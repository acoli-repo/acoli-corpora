## The three little men in the wood 

There was once a man, whose wife was dead, and a woman, whose husband
was dead; and the man had a daughter, and so had the woman. The girls
were acquainted with each other, and used to play together sometimes in
the woman's house. So the woman said to the man's daughter, "Listen
to me, tell your father that I will marry him, and then you shall have
milk to wash in every morning and wine to drink, and my daughter shall
have water to wash in and water to drink." The girl went home and told
her father what the woman had said.

The man said, "What shall I do! Marriage is a joy, and also a
torment." At last, as he could come to no conclusion, he took off his
boot, and said to his daughter, "Take this boot, it has a hole in the
sole; go up with it into the loft, hang it on the big nail and pour
water in it. If it holds water, I will once more take to me a wife; if
it lets out the water, so will I not."

The girl did as she was told, but the water held the hole together, and
the boot was full up to the top. So she went and told her father how it
was. And he went up to see with his own eyes, and as there was no
mistake about it, he went to the widow and courted her, and then they
had the wedding.

The next morning, when the two girls awoke, there stood by the bedside
of the man's daughter milk to wash in and wine to drink, and by the
bedside of the woman's daughter there stood water to wash in and water
to drink. On the second morning there stood water to wash in and water
to drink for both of them alike. On the third morning there stood water
to wash in and water to drink for the man's daughter, and milk to wash
in and wine to drink for the woman's daughter; and so it remained ever
after. The woman hated her stepdaughter, and never knew how to treat her
badly enough from one day to another. And she was jealous because her
stepdaughter was pleasant and pretty, and her real daughter was ugly and
hateful.

Once in winter, when it was freezing hard, and snow lay deep on hill and
valley, the woman made a frock out of paper, called her stepdaughter,
and said, "Here, put on this frock, go out into the wood and fetch me a
basket of strawberries; I have a great wish for some."

"Oh dear," said the girl, "there are no strawberries to be found in
winter; the ground is frozen, and the snow covers everything. And why
should I go in the paper frock? it is so cold out of doors that one's
breath is frozen; the wind will blow through it, and the thorns will
tear it off my back!"

"How dare you contradict me!" cried the stepmother, "be off, and
don't let me see you again till you bring me a basket of
strawberries." Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and
said, "That will do for you to eat during the day," and she thought to
herself, "She is sure to be frozen or starved to death out of doors,
and I shall never set eyes on her again."

So the girl went obediently, put on the paper frock, and started out
with the basket. The snow was lying everywhere, far and wide, and there
was not a blade of green to be seen. When she entered the wood she saw a
little house with three little men peeping out of it. She wished them
good day, and knocked modestly at the door. They called her in, and she
came into the room and sat down by the side of the oven to warm herself
and eat her breakfast. The little men said, "Give us some of it."

"Willingly," answered she, breaking her little piece of bread in two,
and giving them half. They then said, "What are you doing here in the
wood this winter time in your little thin frock?"

"Oh," answered she, "I have to get a basket of strawberries, and I
must not go home without them." When she had eaten her bread they gave
her a broom, and told her to go and sweep the snow away from the back
door. When she had gone outside to do it the little men talked among
themselves about what they should do for her, as she was so good and
pretty, and had shared her bread with them. Then the first one said,
"She shall grow prettier every day." The second said, "Each time she
speaks a piece of gold shall fall from her mouth." The third said, "A
king shall come and take her for his wife."

In the meanwhile the girl was doing as the little men had told her, and
had cleared the snow from the back of the little house, and what do you
suppose she found? fine ripe strawberries, showing dark red against the
snow! Then she joyfully filled her little basket full, thanked the
little men, shook hands with them all, and ran home in haste to bring
her stepmother the thing she longed for. As she went in and said, "Good
evening," a piece of gold fell from her mouth at once. Then she related
all that had happened to her in the wood, and at each word that she
spoke gold pieces fell out of her mouth, so that soon they were
scattered all over the room.

"Just look at her pride and conceit!" cried the stepsister, "throwing
money about in this way!" but in her heart she was jealous because of
it, and wanted to go too into the wood to fetch strawberries. But the
mother said, "No, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, you will be
frozen to death." But she left her no peace, so at last the mother gave
in, got her a splendid fur coat to put on, and gave her bread and butter
and cakes to eat on the way.

The girl went into the wood and walked straight up to the little house.
The three little men peeped out again, but she gave them no greeting,
and without looking round or taking any notice of them she came stumping
into the room, sat herself down by the oven, and began to eat her bread
and butter and cakes.

"Give us some of that," cried the little men, but she answered,
"I've not enough for myself; how can I give away any?" Now when she
had done with her eating, they said, "Here is a broom, go and sweep all
clean by the back door."

"Oh, go and do it yourselves," answered she; "I am not your
housemaid." But when she saw that they were not going to give her
anything, she went out to the door. Then the three little men said among
themselves, "What shall we do to her, because she is so unpleasant, and
has such a wicked jealous heart, grudging everybody everything?" The
first said, "She shall grow uglier every day." The second said, "Each
time she speaks a toad shall jump out of her mouth at every word." The
third said, "She shall die a miserable death."

The girl was looking outside for strawberries, but as she found none,
she went sulkily home. And directly she opened her mouth to tell her
mother what had happened to her in the wood a toad sprang out of her
mouth at each word, so that every one who came near her was quite
disgusted.

The stepmother became more and more set against the man's daughter,
whose beauty increased day by day, and her only thought was how to do
her some injury. So at last she took a kettle, set it on the fire, and
scalded some yarn in it. When it was ready she hung it over the poor
girl's shoulder, and gave her an axe, and she was to go to the frozen
river and break a hole in the ice, and there to rinse the yarn. She
obeyed, and went and hewed a hole in the ice, and as she was about it
there came by a splendid coach, in which the King sat. The coach stood
still, and the King said, "My child, who art thou, and what art thou
doing there?"

She answered, "I am a poor girl, and am rinsing yarn." Then the King
felt pity for her, and as he saw that she was very beautiful, he said,
"Will you go with me?"

"Oh yes, with all my heart," answered she; and she felt very glad to
be out of the way of her mother and sister.

So she stepped into the coach and went off with the King; and when they
reached his castle the wedding was celebrated with great splendour, as
the little men in the wood had foretold.
At the end of a year the young Queen had a son; and as the stepmother
had heard of her great good fortune she came with her daughter to the
castle, as if merely to pay the King and Queen a visit. One day, when
the King had gone out, and when nobody was about, the bad woman took the
Queen by the head, and her daughter took her by the heels, and dragged
her out of bed, and threw her out of the window into a stream that
flowed beneath it. Then the old woman put her ugly daughter in the bed,
and covered her up to her chin.

When the King came back, and wanted to talk to his wife a little, the
old woman cried, "Stop, stop! she is sleeping nicely; she must be kept
quiet to day." The King dreamt of nothing wrong, and came again the
next morning; and as he spoke to his wife, and she answered him, there
jumped each time out of her mouth a toad instead of the piece of gold as
heretofore. Then he asked why that should be, and the old woman said it
was because of her great weakness, and that it would pass away.

But in the night, the boy who slept in the kitchen saw how something in
the likeness of a duck swam up the gutter, and said,

"My King, what mak'st thou?
Sleepest thou, or wak'st thou?"

But there was no answer. Then it said,

"What cheer my two guests keep they?"

So the kitchen-boy answered,

"In bed all soundly sleep they."

It asked again,

"And my little baby, how does he?"

And he answered,

"He sleeps in his cradle quietly."

Then the duck took the shape of the Queen and went to the child, and
gave him to drink, smoothed his little bed, covered him up again, and
then, in the likeness of a duck, swam back down the gutter. In this way
she came two nights, and on the third she said to the kitchen-boy, "Go
and tell the King to brandish his sword three times over me on the
threshold!" Then the kitchen-boy ran and told the King, and he came
with his sword and brandished it three times over the duck, and at the
third time his wife stood before him living, and hearty, and sound, as
she had been before.

The King was greatly rejoiced, but he hid the Queen in a chamber until
the Sunday came when the child was to be baptized. And after the baptism
he said, "What does that person deserve who drags another out of; bed
and throws him in the water?"

And the old woman answered, "No better than to be put into a cask with
iron nails in it, and to be rolled in it down the hill into the water."
Then said the King, "You have spoken your own sentence;"and he ordered
a cask to be fetched, and the old woman and her daughter were put into
it, and the top hammered down, and the cask was rolled down the hill
into the river.
