## Sleeping Beauty (Little Briar Rose) 

In times past there lived a king and queen, who said to each other every
day of their lives, "Would that we had a child!" and yet they had
none. But it happened once that when the queen was bathing, there came a
frog out of the water, and he squatted on the ground, and said to her:
"Thy wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, thou shalt
bring a daughter into the world."

And as the frog foretold, so it happened; and the queen bore a daughter
so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he
ordained a great feast. Not only did he bid to it his relations,
friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be
kind and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his
kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to
eat from, one of them had to be left out.

However, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to
an end, the wise women stood forward to present to the child their
wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so
on, whatever there is in the world to wish for. And when eleven of them
had said their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, burning to revenge
herself, and without greeting or respect, she cried with a loud voice:
"In the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with
a spindle and shall fall down dead." And without speaking one more word
she turned away and left the hall. Every one was terrified at her
saying, when the twelfth came forward, for she had not yet bestowed her
gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she
could soften it, so she said: "The princess shall not die, but fall
into a deep sleep for a hundred years."

Now the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this
misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should
be burnt up. The maiden grew up, adorned with all the gifts of the wise
women; and she was so lovely, modest, sweet, and kind and clever, that
no one who saw her could help loving her. It happened one day, she being
already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the
maiden was left behind alone in the castle. She wandered about into all
the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the
fancy took her, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed the
narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key
sticking out of the lock; she turned the key, and the door opened, and
there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently
spinning her flax.

"Good day, mother," said the princess, "what are you doing?" - "I
am spinning," answered the old woman, nodding her head. "What thing is
that that twists round so briskly?" asked the maiden, and taking the
spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had she touched
it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with
it. In that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there, and
lay in a deep sleep.

And this sleep fell upon the whole castle; the king and queen, who had
returned and were in the great hall, fell fast asleep, and with them the
whole court. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the
pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, the very fire that flickered
on the hearth, became still, and slept like the rest; and the meat on
the spit ceased roasting, and the cook, who was going to pull the
scullion's hair for some mistake he had made, let him go, and went to
sleep. And the wind ceased, and not a leaf fell from the trees about the
castle. Then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker
every year, until at last the whole castle was hidden from view, and
nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof.

And a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping
Rosamond, for so was the princess called; and from time to time many
kings' sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge; but it
was impossible for them to do so, for the thorns held fast together like
strong hands, and the young men were caught by them, and not being able
to get free, there died a lamentable death.

Many a long year afterwards there came a king's son into that country,
and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing behind
the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named
Rosamond had slept for a hundred years, and with her the king and queen,
and the whole court. The old man had been told by his grandfather that
many king's sons had sought to pass the thorn-hedge, but had been
caught and pierced by the thorns, and had died a miserable death. Then
said the young man: "Nevertheless, I do not fear to try; I shall win
through and see the lovely Rosamond." The good old man tried to
dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words. For now the hundred
years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be
awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns, it was changed
into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to
let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge. When he
reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs
lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads
under their wings. And when he came indoors, the flies on the wall were
asleep, the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the
scullion, and the kitchen-maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to
pluck.

Then he mounted higher, and saw in the hall the whole court lying
asleep, and above them, on their thrones, slept the king and the queen.
And still he went farther, and all was so quiet that he could hear his
own breathing; and at last he came to the tower, and went up the winding
stair, and opened the door of the little room where Rosamond lay. And
when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away
his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her.

And she awaked, and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And
she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and
whole court waked up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of
wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the
hounds sprang up and wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew
their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the
field, the flies on the wall crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire
leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to
roast, the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared
out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl.

Then the wedding of the Prince and Rosamond was held with all splendour,
and they lived very happily together until their lives' end.
