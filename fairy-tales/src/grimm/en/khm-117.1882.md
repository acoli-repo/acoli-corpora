## The wilful child 

Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not dowh
at her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and
let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short
time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave,
and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again,
and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh
earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out
again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and
strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in,
and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground.
