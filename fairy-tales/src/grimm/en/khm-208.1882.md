## Our lady's little glass 

Once upon a time a waggoner's cart which was heavily laden with wine
had stuck so fast that in spite of all that he could do, he could not
get it to move again. Then it chanced that Our Lady just happened to
come by that way, and when she perceived the poor man's distress, she
said to him, "I am tired and thirsty, give me a glass of wine, and I
will set thy cart free for thee." - "Willingly," answered the
waggoner, "but I have no glass in which I can give thee the wine."
Then Our Lady plucked a little white flower with red stripes, called
field bindweed, which looks very like a glass, and gave it to the
waggoner. He filled it with wine, and then Our Lady drank it, and in the
self-same instant the cart was set free, and the waggoner could drive
onwards. The little flower is still always called Our Lady's Little
Glass.
