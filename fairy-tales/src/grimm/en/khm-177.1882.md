## The duration of life 

When God had created the world and was about to fix the length of each
creature's life, the ass came and asked, "Lord, how long shall I
live?" - "Thirty years," replied God; "does that content thee?" -
"Ah, Lord," answered the ass, "that is a long time. Think of my
painful existence! To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag
sacks of corn to the mill, that others may eat bread, to be cheered and
refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks. Relieve me of a portion of
this long time." Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen
years. The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared. "How long
wouldst thou like to live?" said God to him. "Thirty years are too
many for the ass, but thou wilt be satisfied with that." - "Lord,"
answered the dog, "is that thy will? Consider how I shall have to run,
my feet will never hold out so long, and when I have once lost my voice
for barking, and my teeth for biting, what will be left for me to do but
run from one corner to another and growl?" God saw that he was right,
and released him from twelve years of life. Then came the monkey. "Thou
wilt certainly live thirty years willingly?" said the Lord to him.
"Thou hast no need to work as the ass and the dog have to do, and wilt
always enjoy thyself." - "Ah! Lord," he answered, "it may seem as if
that were the case, but it is quite different. When it rains porridge I
have no spoon. I am always to play merry pranks, and make faces which
force people to laugh, and if they give me an apple, and I bite into it,
why it is sour! How often sadness hides itself behind mirth! I shall
never be able to hold out for thirty years." God was gracious and took
off ten.
At last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to
appoint his time for him. "Thirty years shalt thou live," said the
Lord. "Is that enough for thee?" - "What a short time," cried man,
"when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own hearth; when I
have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit, and am just intending
to enjoy my life, I am to die! O Lord, lengthen my time." - "I will
add to it the ass's eighteen years," said God. "That is not enough,"
replied the man. "Thou shalt also have the dog's twelve years." -
"Still too little!" - "Well, then," said God, "I will give thee the
monkey's ten years also, but more thou shalt not have." The man went
away, but was not satisfied.

So man lives seventy years. The first thirty are his human years, which
are soon gone; then is he healthy, merry, works with pleasure, and is
glad of his life. Then follow the ass's eighteen years, when one burden
after another is laid on him, he has to carry the corn which feeds
others, and blows and kicks are the reward of his faithful services.
Then come the dog's twelve years, when he lies in the corner, and
growls and has no longer any teeth to bite with, and when this time is
over the monkey's ten years form the end. Then man is weak- headed and
foolish, does silly things, and becomes the jest of the children.
