## How children played slaughter with each other 

I

In a city named Franecker, located in West Friesland, some young boys
and girls between the ages of five and six happened to be playing with
one another. They chose one boy to play a butcher, another boy to play
was to be a cook, and a third boy was to be a pig. Then they chose one
girl to be a cook and another girl her assistant. The assistant was to
catch the blood of the pig in a little bowl so they could make sausages.
As agreed, the butcher now fell upon the little boy playing the pig,
threw him to the ground, and slit his throat open with a knife, while
the assistant cook caught the blood in her little bowl. A councilman was
walking nearby and saw this wretched act. He immediately took the
butcher with him and led him into the house of the mayor, who instantly
summoned the entire council. They deliberated about this incident and
did not know what they should do to the boy, for they realized it had
all been part of a children's game. One of the councilmen, an old wise
man, advised the chief judge to take a beautiful red apple in one hand
and a Rhenish gulden in the other. Then he was to call the boy and
stretch out his hands to him. If the boy took the apple, he was to be
set free. If he took the gulden, he was to be killed. The judge took the
wise man's advice, and the boy grabbed the apple with a laugh. Thus he
was set free without any punishment.

There once was a father who slaughtered a pig, and his children saw
that. In the afternoon, when they began playing, one child said to the
other, "you be the little pig, and I'll be the butcher." He then took
a shiny knife and slit his little brother's throat. Their mother was
upstairs in a room bathing another child, and when she heard the cries
of her son, she immediately ran downstairs. Upon seeing what had
happened, she took the knife out of her son's throat and was so enraged
that she stabbed the heart of the other boy, who had been playing the
butcher. Then she quickly ran back to the room to tend to her child in
the bathtub, but while she was gone, he had drowned in the tub. Now the
woman became so frightened and desperate that she did not allow the
neighbors to comfort her and finally hung herself. When her husband came
back from the fields and saw everything, he became so despondent that he
died soon after.
