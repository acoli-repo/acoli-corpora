## Frau Trude 

There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive, and when
her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them, so how could
she fare well? One day she said to her parents, "I have heard so much
of Frau Trude, I will go to her some day. People say that everything
about her does look so strange, and that there are such odd things in
her house, that I have become quite curious!" Her parents absolutely
forbade her, and said, "Frau Trude is a bad woman, who does wicked
things, and if thou goest to her; thou art no longer our child." But
the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parent's
prohibition, and still went to Frau Trude. And when she got to her, Frau
Trude said, "Why art thou so pale?" - "Ah," she replied, and her
whole body trembled, "I have been so terrified at what I have seen." -
"What hast thou seen?" - "I saw a black man on your steps." - "That
was a collier." - "Then I saw a green man." - "That was a
huntsman." - "After that I saw a blood-red man." - "That was a
butcher." - "Ah, Frau Trude, I was terrified; I looked through the
window and saw not you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with
a head of fire." - "Oho!" said she, "then thou hast seen the witch
in her proper costume. I have been waiting for thee, and wanting thee a
long time already; thou shalt give me some light." Then she changed the
girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the fire. And when it was
in full blaze she sat down close to it, and warmed herself by it, and
said, "That shines bright for once in a way."
