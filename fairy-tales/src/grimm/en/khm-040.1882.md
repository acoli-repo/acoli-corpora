## The robber bridegroom 

There was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she was
grown up he became anxious that she should be well married and taken
care of; so he thought, "If a decent sort of man comes and asks her in
marriage, I will give her to him." Soon after a suitor came forward who
seemed very well to do, and as the miller knew nothing to his
disadvantage, he promised him his daughter. But the girl did not seem to
love him as a bride should love her bridegroom; she had no confidence in
him; as often as she saw him or thought about him, she felt a chill at
her heart. One day he said to her, "You are to be my bride, and yet you
have never been to see me." The girl answered, "I do not know where
your house is." Then he said, "My house is a long way in the wood."
She began to make excuses, and said she could not find the way to it;
but the bridegroom said, "You must come and pay me a visit next Sunday;
I have already invited company, and I will strew ashes on the path
through the wood, so that you will be sure to find it."

When Sunday came, and the girl set out on her way, she felt very uneasy
without knowing exactly why; and she filled both pockets full of peas
and lentils. There were ashes strewed on the path through the wood, but,
nevertheless, at each step she cast to the right and left a few peas on
the ground. So she went on the whole day until she came to the middle of
the wood, where it was the darkest, and there stood a lonely house, not
pleasant in her eyes, for it was dismal and unhomelike. She walked in,
but there was no one there, and the greatest stillness reigned. Suddenly
she heard a voice cry,

"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,
Within this house thou must not bide,
For here do evil things betide."

The girl glanced round, and perceived that the voice came from a bird
who was hanging in a cage by the wall. And again it cried,

"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,
Within this house thou must not bide,
For here do evil things betide."

Then the pretty bride went on from one room into another through the
whole house, but it was quite empty, and no soul to be found in it. At
last she reached the cellar, and there sat a very old woman nodding her
head. "Can you tell me," said the bride, "if my bridegroom lives
here?" - "Oh, poor child," answered the old woman, "do you know what
has happened to you? You are in a place of cutthroats. You thought you
were a bride, and soon to be married, but death will be your spouse.
Look here, I have a great kettle of water to set on, and when once they
have you in their power they will cut you in pieces without mercy, cook
you, and eat you, for they are cannibals. Unless I have pity on you, and
save you, all is over with you!"

Then the old woman hid her behind a great cask, where she could not be
seen. "Be as still as a mouse," said she; "do not move or go away, or
else you are lost. At night, when the robbers are asleep, we will
escape. I have been waiting a long time for an opportunity." No sooner
was it settled than the wicked gang entered the house. They brought
another young woman with them, dragging her along, and they were drunk,
and would not listen to her cries and groans. They gave her wine to
drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of
yellow, and then they cut her in pieces. The poor bride all the while
shaking and trembling when she saw what a fate the robbers had intended
for her. One of them noticed on the little finger of their victim a
golden ring, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took an axe and
chopped it off, but the finger jumped away, and fell behind the cask on
the bride's lap. The robber took up a light to look for it, but he
could not find it. Then said one of the others, "Have you looked behind
the great cask?" But the old woman cried, "Come to supper, and leave
off looking till to-morrow; the finger cannot run away."

Then the robbers said the old woman was right, and they left off
searching, and sat down to eat, and the old woman dropped some sleeping
stuff into their wine, so that before long they stretched themselves on
the cellar floor, sleeping and snoring. When the bride heard that, she
came from behind the cask, and had to make her way among the sleepers
lying all about on the ground, and she felt very much afraid lest she
might awaken any of them. But by good luck she passed through, and the
old woman with her, and they opened the door, and they made all haste to
leave that house of murderers. The wind had carried away the ashes from
the path, but the peas and lentils had budded and sprung up, and the
moonshine upon them showed the way. And they went on through the night,
till in the morning they reached the mill. Then the girl related to her
father all that had happened to her.

When the wedding-day came, the friends and neighbours assembled, the
miller having invited them, and the bridegroom also appeared. When they
were all seated at table, each one had to tell a story. But the bride
sat still, and said nothing, till at last the bridegroom said to her,
"Now, sweetheart, do you know no story? Tell us something." She
answered, "I will tell you my dream. I was going alone through a wood,
and I came at last to a house in which there was no living soul, but by
the wall was a bird in a cage, who cried,

"Turn back, turn back, thou pretty bride,
Within this house thou must not bide,
For evil things do here betide."

And then again it said it. Sweetheart, the dream is not ended. Then I
went through all the rooms, and they were all empty, and it was so
lonely and wretched. At last I went down into the cellar, and there sat
an old old woman, nodding her head. I asked her if my bridegroom lived
in that house, and she answered, ' Ah, poor child, you have come into a
place of cut-throats; your bridegroom does live here, but he will kill
you and cut you in pieces, and then cook and eat you.' Sweetheart, the
dream is not ended. But the old woman hid me behind a great cask, and no
sooner had she done so than the robbers came home, dragging with them a
young woman, and they gave her to drink wine thrice, white, red, and
yellow. Sweetheart, the dream is not yet ended. And then they killed
her, and cut her in pieces. Sweetheart, my dream is not yet ended. And
one of the robbers saw a gold ring on the finger of the young woman, and
as it was difficult to get off, he took an axe and chopped off the
finger, which jumped upwards, and then fell behind the great cask on my
lap. And here is the finger with the ring!" At these words she drew it
forth, and showed it to the company.

The robber, who during the story had grown deadly white, sprang up, and
would have escaped, but the folks held him fast, and delivered him up to
justice. And he and his whole gang were, for their evil deeds, condemned
and executed.
