## The fox and the geese 

The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on
which he smiled and said, "I come in the nick of time, you are sitting
together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the
other." The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and
beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and
said, "There is no mercy to be had! You must die." At length one of
them took heart and said, "If we poor geese are to yield up our
vigorous young lives, show us the only possible favour and allow us one
more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place
ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the
fattest." - "Yes," said the fox, "that is reasonable, and a pious
request. Pray away, I will wait till you are done." Then the first
began a good long prayer, for ever saying, "Ga! Ga!" and as she would
make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began
also, "Ga! Ga!" The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were
all cackling together.

When they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but
at present they are still praying without stopping."
