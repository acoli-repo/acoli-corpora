## The brother and sister 

The brother took his sister's hand and said to her, "Since our mother
died we have had no good days; our stepmother beats us every day, and if
we go near her she kicks us away; we have nothing to eat but hard crusts
of bread left over; the dog under the table fares better," he gets a
good piece every now and then. If our mother only knew, how she would
pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide world!" So they
went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony
places, and if it rained the sister said, "The skies and we are weeping
together." In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so
weary with hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a
high tree and fell asleep.

The next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone
brightly through the leaves. Then said the brother, "Sister, I am
thirsty; if I only knew where to find a brook, that I might go and
drink! I almost think that I hear one rushing."

So the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to
seek the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known
quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after
them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the
forest.

So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles,
the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said
in its rushing, "He a tiger will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me
a tiger will be!"

Then the sister cried, "Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will
become a wild beast, and will tear me in pieces."

So the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and
he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. When they came to
a second brook the sister heard it say, "He a wolf will be who drinks
of me, Who drinks of me a wolf will be!"

Then the sister cried, "Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will
be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!"

So the brother refrained from drinking, and said, "I will wait until we
come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; my
thirst is so great."

And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its
rushing it said, "Who drinks of me a fawn will be, He a fawn will be
who drinks of me!"

Then the sister said, "O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be
turned into a fawn, and run away far from me."

But he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and
drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a
fawn.

And the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also,
and stayed sadly beside her. At last the maiden said, "Be comforted,
dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you." Then she untied her golden
girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck, and went and gathered rushes
to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; and then she led him on,
and they went deeper into the forest. And when they had gone a long long
way, they came at last to a little house, and the maiden looked inside,
and as it was empty she thought, "We might as well live here." And she
fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every
morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for
herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy,
frolicking round her. At night, when the sister was tired, and had said
her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for
a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got
back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life.

So they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. Now it happened that
the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. The blowing of
the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen
sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be
among them.

"Oh," said he to his sister," do let me go to the hunt; I cannot stay
behind any longer," and begged so long that at last she consented.

"But mind," said she to him," come back to me at night. I must lock
my door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you
must knock and say, ' Little sister, let me in,' and unless I hear
that I shall not unlock the door." Then the fawn sprang out, and felt
glad and merry in the open air. The King and his huntsmen saw the
beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not
come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him
he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared. As soon as it was dark
he went back to the little house, knocked at the door, and said,
"Little sister, let me in." Then the door was opened to him, and he
went in, and rested the whole night long on his soft bed.

The next morning the hunt began anew, and when the fawn heard the
hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer,
and said, "Little sister, let me out, I must go"

The sister opened the door and said, "Now, mind you must come back at
night and say the same words." When the King and his hunters saw the
fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was
too nimble and swift for them. This lasted the whole day, and at last
the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little,
so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. Then a hunter slipped
after him to the little house, and heard how he called out," Little
sister, let me in," and saw the door open and shut again after him
directly., The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and
told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the King, "To-morrow we
will hunt again."

But the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was
wounded. She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said,"
Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well."
The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next
morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said,
"I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily
again!"

The sister began to weep, and said, "I know you will be killed, and I
left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. I cannot let
you go!"

"Then I shall die here with longing," answered the fawn;" when I hear
the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin."

Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with
a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and
merry.

When the King saw him, he said to his hunters, "Now, follow him up all
day long till the night comes, and see that you do him no hurt." So as
soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen:" Now,
come and show me the little house in the wood." And when he got to the
door he knocked at it, and cried, "Little sister, let me in!" Then the
door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more
beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out when she
saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his
head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said,
"Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?"

"Oh yes," answered the maiden, "but the fawn must come too. I could
not leave him." And the King said, "He shall remain with you as long
as you live, and shall lack nothing." Then the fawn came bounding in,
and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him, and led him by her own
hand out of the little house.

The King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his
castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; so she became lady
Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; the fawn was
well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden. Now
the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven
out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up
by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a
fawn, had been slain by the hunters. But when she heard that they were
so happy, and that things had gone so well with them, jealousy and envy
arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her chief thought was how
to bring misfortune upon them. Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin,
and had only one eye, complained to her, and said, "I never had the
chance of being a Queen."

"Never mind," said the old woman, to satisfy her;" when the time
comes, I shall be at hand." After a while the Queen brought a beautiful
baby-boy into the world, and that day the King was out hunting. The old
witch took the shape of the bedchamber woman, and went into the room
where the Queen lay, and said to her, "Come, the bath is ready; it will
give you refreshment and new strength. Quick, or it will be cold." Her
daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the
bath-room, and left her there. And in the bath-room they had made a
great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen.

When that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on
her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen's place, gave her also the
Queen's form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye.
So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the
side where there was no eye. In the evening, when the King came home and
heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart,
and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did.
Then the old woman cried hastily, "For your life, do not draw back the
curtains, to let in the light upon her; she must be kept quiet." So the
King went away, and never knew that a false Queen was lying in the bed.

Now, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was
sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the
door open, and the true Queen come in. She took the child out of the
cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. Then she shook out its little
pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. She
did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the
corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence
out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any
one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen
no one.

And the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; the nurse saw her
always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one.

After some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find
voice, and said one night,

"My child my fawn twice more I come to see,
Twice more I come, and then the end must be."

The nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she
went to the King and told him all. The King said, "Ah, heaven! what do
I hear! I will myself watch by the child to-morrow night." So at
evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen appeared,
and said,

"My child my fawn once more I come to see,
Once more I come, and then the end must be."

And she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she
vanished. The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the
following night, and heard her say,

"My child my fawn this once I come to see,
This once I come, and now the end must be."

Then the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her,
saying, "You are no other than my dear wife!"

Then she answered, "Yes, I am your dear wife," and in that moment, by
the grace of heaven, her life returned to her, and she was once more
well and strong. Then she told the King the snare that the wicked witch
and her daughter had laid for her.

The King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence was passed upon
them. The daughter was sent away into the wood, where she was devoured
by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended miserably. And
as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn,
and he took human shape again; and then the sister and brother lived
happily together until the end.
