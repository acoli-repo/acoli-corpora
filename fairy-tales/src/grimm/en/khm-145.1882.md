## The ungrateful son 

A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house, and
they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about to eat it
together. Then the man saw that his aged father was coming, and hastily
took the chicken and hid it, for he would not permit him to have any of
it. The old man came, took a drink, and went away. Now the son wanted to
put the roasted chicken on the table again, but when he took it up, it
had become a great toad, which jumped into his face and sat there and
never went away again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked
venomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no one would
venture to touch it. And the ungrateful son was forced to feed the toad
every day, or else it fed itself on his face; and thus he went about the
world without knowing rest.
