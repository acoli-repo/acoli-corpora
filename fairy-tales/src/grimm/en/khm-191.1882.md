## The crumbs on the table 

A countryman one day said to his little puppies: "Come into the parlour
and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table; your
mistress has gone out to pay some visits." Then the little dogs said:
"No, no, we will not go. If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat
us." The countryman said: "She will know nothing about it. Do come;
after all, she never gives you anything good." Then the little dogs
again said: "Nay, nay, we must let it alone; we must not go." But the
countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on
the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might. But at that
very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and
beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the
house, the little dogs said to the countryman: "Dost, dost, dost, dost,
dost thou see?" Then the countryman laughed and said: "Didn't,
didn't, didn't, you expect it?" So they just had to run away.
