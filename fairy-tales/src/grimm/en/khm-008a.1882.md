## The hand with the knife 

There once lived a girl who had three brothers. The boys meant
everything to their mother, and the girl was always put at a
disadvantage and treated badly. Every day she had to go out to a barren
heath to dig peat, which was used for cooking and heating. A dull old
tool was all she had for that nasty work.

The little girl had an admirer, an elf who lived in a hill near her
mother's house. Whenever she passed by that hill, the elf would stretch
his hand out of a boulder and hold out a very sharp knife that had
special powers and could cut through anything. She was able to dig out
the peat quickly with that knife, go home with the required amount, and
when she got to the boulder, she tapped on it twice. The hand would then
reach out to take back the knife.

When the mother began to notice how quickly and effortlessly the girl
brouhgt home the peat, she told the brothers that someone else had to be
helping her with the work, otherwise it wouldn't be possible. The
brothers stealthily followed her and saw how she got the magical knife,
then caught up with her and forced her to give it to them. They headed
back, struck the rock as the girl had done, and when the good elf
stretched his hand out, they cut it off with his own knife. The bloody
arm pulled back, and because the elf believed that his beloved had
betrayed him, he was never seen again.
