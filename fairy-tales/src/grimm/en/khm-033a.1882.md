## Puss in Boots 

A miller had three sons, his mill, a donkey and a tom cat; the sons had
to grind, the donkey had to get grain and carry flour away and the cat
had to catch the mice away. When the miller died, the three brothers
divided their inheritance, the oldest received the mill, the second the
donkey and the third the tom cat, further was nothing left for him.
Thereon he was sad ans spoke to himself: "But I have gotten all the
worst, my oldest brother can mill, my second can ride on his donkey,
what can I start with the tom cat? Let me make a pair of fur gloves out
of his pelt, so it's over."

"Listen," said the tom cat, who had understood everything, what he
said, "you do not need to kill me, to get a pair of bad gloves from my
pelt, let only a pair of boots be made for me, that I can go out, and be
seen among the people, then you will soon be helped." The miller's son
was in wonderment, that the tom cat so spoke, but because the shoemaker
just walked by, he called him in, and let a pair of boots be measured
for him. When they were ready, the tom cat put them on, took a sack,
made the bottom of the same full of corn, but on the top a string, with
which one could pull it closed, then he threw it over his back and went
on two legs, like a human, out the door.

In those days reigned a king in the land, he liked to eat partridges so
much: there was a need, that none were to be gotten. The whole forest
was full, but they were so shy, that no hunter could reach them. The tom
cat knew that and considered to do his matter better; when he came into
the forest, he made the sack open, spread the corn apart, but the cord
he laid into the grass and led it behind a hedge. There he hid himself,
snuck around and lurked. The partridges soon came running, and one after
the other hopped into the sack. When a good quantity was in it, the tom
cat pulled the cord closed, ran to and twisted their heads around; then
he threw the sack over his shoulder and went straight away to the
king's palace. The watch cried: "Halt! Whereto?" - "To the king,"
answered the tom cat quickly. - "Are you crazed, a tom cat to the
king?" - "Just let him go, said another, the king has often boredom,
maybe the tom cat makes him amused with his humming and spinning. When
the tom cat came in front of the king, he made a Reverence and said:
"My Herr, the Graf, with that he named his long and distinguished name,
lets himself be recommended to the Herr King and sends him these
partridges, that he just caught in slings. The king astonished over the
beautiful fat partridges, knew not out of pleasure how to contain
himself, and commanded that the tom cat be given as much gold out of the
treasure chamber into his sack, as he could carry: "That bring to your
Herren and thank him again many times for his gift."

But the poor miller's son sat at home at the window, supported his head
an his hand and thought, that he had spent his last for the tom cat's
boots, and what large things will he be able to bring back. Thereon the
tom cat stepped in, threw the sack from his hack, untied it open and
shook the gold in front of the miller: "There you have something for
the hoots, the king also greets you and says many thanks to you." The
miller was glad over the wealth, without understanding rightly, how it
came to be. But the tom cat, as he took off his boots, told him
everything, then he said: "You do have money enough now, but it should
not stay with that, tomorrow I will put my boots on again, you will
become richer still, I also told the king, that you are a Graf." On the
next day the torn cat went, as he had said, well booted to hunting
again, and brought the king a rich catch. So it went all days, and the
tom cat brought gold home all days, and was so popular as one by the
king, that he was allowed to come in and go out and prowl around in the
palace, where he wanted. One time the tom cat stood in the king's
kitchen by the stove and warmed himself, thereon came the coach man and
cursed: "I wish king and the princess were at the executioner! I wanted
to go to Wirtshaus and drink once and play cards, there I should drive
them spazieren at the lake." As the tom cat heard that, he snuck home
and told his Herrn: "If a Graf you want to be and become rich, so come
outside with me to the lake and bathe yourself therein." The miller did
not know, what he should say to that, but followed the tom cat, went
with him, undressed splinter naked and sprang into the water. But the
tom cat took his clothes, carried them away and hid them. No sooner was
he finished with that, thereon came the king driving by; the tom cat
immediately began, pathetically to lament: "Ach! All merciful king!
Mein Herr, bathed himself here in the lake, thereon a thief came and
stole his clothes, that lay on the shore, now the Herr Graf is in the
water and can not come out, and if he stays in longer he will calch cold
and die." When the king heard that, he called halt and one of his
people had to chase back and of the king's clothes bring hack. The Herr
Graf put on the magnificent clothes, and because the king anyway for the
partridges, that he thought to have received from him, held his worth,
so he had to sit with them in the carriage. The princess was also not
upset over it, because the Graf was young and handsome, and she liked
him quite well.

But the tom cat went ahead and came to a large grass field, where over a
hundred people were making hay. "Who does this grass field belong to,
you people?" said the tom cat. - "The great magician." - "Listen,
the king will soon drive by, when he asks, who the grass field belongs
to, so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do that, you will all be
struck dead." Thereon the tom cat went further and came to a grain
field, so large, that no one could oversee it, there stood more than two
hundred people and cut the grain. "Who's grain is this you people?" -
"The magician." - "Listen, the king will drive by now, when he asks,
who the grain belongs to, so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do
that, vou will all be struck dead." - Finally the tom cat came to a
magnificent forest, there stood more than three hundred people, felled
the big oaks and made wood. - "Who's forest is this, you people?" -
"The magician." - "Listen, the king will drive by now, when he asks,
who the forest belongs to so answer: the Grafen; and if you do not do
that, you will all be killed." The tom cat went still furlher, the
people all looked after him, and because he looked so wonderly, and as a
human walked in the boots, they were afraid of him. He soon came to the
magicians palace, stepped boldly in and in front of him. The magician
looked at him contemptuously, and asked him, what he wanted. The tom cat
made a Reverenz and said: "I have beard, that vou could transform
yourself into every animal you chose by your own will; what a hound,
fox, or even wolf concerns, that I will well believe, but of an
elephant, that seems to me quite impossible, and therefore I have come
to convince myself." The magician said proudly: "That is a trifle to
me," and in that wink-of-an-eye was transformed into an elephant.
"That is much, but also in a lion?" - "That is also nothing," said
the magician and stood as a lion in front of the tom cat. The tom cat
made as if startled, and cried: "That is unbelievable and unheard of,
the same I would never had dreamt of coming into my thoughts; but more
still, all else, it would be, if you could transform yourself into such
a small animal, as a mouse is, you can certainly do more, than any other
magician in the world, but that will be certainly too high for you. The
magician was very friendly from the sweet words and said: "O'ja, dear
cat-let, that I can also," and sprang as a mouse around the room. The
tom cat was after him, caught the mouse with one jump and ate him up.

But the king was still driving spazieren with the Grafen and the
princess, and came to the large field. "Who does the hay belong to?"
asked the king - "The Herr Grafen" - cried all, as the tom cat had
commanded them. - "Thou have a pretty piece of land, Herr Graf," said
he. Thereafter they came to the large grain field: "Who does the grain
belong to, you people?" - "The Herrn Grafen." - "Ei! Herr Graf!
large, big estates!" - "Thereon to the forest: "who does the wood
belong to, you people?" - "The Herrn Grafen." - The king was
astonished even more and said: "Thou must be a rich man, Herr Graf, I
do not believe, that I have such a magnificent forest." Finally they
came to the palace, the tom cat stood on top of the stairs, and as the
wagon stopped below, he sprang down, opened the door and said: "Herr
King, thou comest to the palace of my Herr, the Graf, that this honors
him and makes him happv his life day long." The king stepped out and
marveled at the magnificent building, that was almost larger and more
beautiful, than his own palace; but the Graf led the princess up the
stairs into the hall, that was shimmering with gold and precious stones.

Thereon the princess was promised to the Graf, and when the king died,
he was king, but the booted tom cat became first minister.
