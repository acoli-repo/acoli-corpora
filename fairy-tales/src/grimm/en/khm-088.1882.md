## The singing, springing lark 

There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long
journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should
bring back with him for them. Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls,
the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, "Dear father, I
should like a singing, soaring lark." The father said, "Yes, if I can
get it, you shall have it," kissed all three, and set out. Now when the
time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls
and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain
for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy
about it, for she was his favorite child. Then his road lay through a
forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the
castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing,
soaring lark. "Aha, you come just at the right moment!" he said, quite
delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little
creature. But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it,
shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled. "He
who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark," he cried, "will I
devour." Then the man said, "I did not know that the bird belonged to
thee. I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself
with a large sum of money, only spare my life." The lion said,
"Nothing can save thee, unless thou wilt promise to give me for mine
own what first meets thee on thy return home; and if thou wilt do that,
I will grant thee thy life, and thou shalt have the bird for thy
daughter, into the bargain." But the man hesitated and said, "That
might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to
meet me on my return home." The servant, however, was terrified and
said, "Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might
as easily be a cat, or dog?" Then the man allowed himself to be
over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the
lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home.
When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no
other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up,
kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a
singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy. The father,
however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, "My dearest
child, I have bought the little bird dear. In return for it, I have been
obliged to promise thee to a savage lion, and when he has thee he will
tear thee in pieces and devour thee," and he told her all, just as it
had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might. But she
consoled him and said, "Dearest father, indeed your promise must be
fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return
to thee safely." Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took
leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest. The lion, however, was
an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions
with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. On
her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle. When night
came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was
celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together,
remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime. One day he came and
said, "To-morrow there is a feast in thy father's house, because your
eldest sister is to be married, and if thou art inclined to go there, my
lions shall conduct thee." She said, "Yes, I should very much like to
see my father again," and went thither, accompanied by the lions. There
was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had
been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live. But she
told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was,
remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back
again to the forest. When the second daughter was about to be married,
and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, "This
time I will not be alone, thou must come with me." The lion, however,
said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a
burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for
seven years long would have to fly about with the doves. She said, "Ah,
but do come with me, I will take great care of thee, and guard thee from
all light." So they went away together, and took with them their little
child as well. She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that
no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when
the candles were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of
green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.
The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession
with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by
this apartment, a ray about the bredth of a hair fell on the King's
son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant,
and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a
white dove was sitting there. The dove said to her, "For seven years
must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I
will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will
show thee the way, and if thou followest the trace thou canst release
me." Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and
at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather
fell down and showed her the way.

So she went continually further and further in the wide world, never
looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then
she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they
were so far from it! Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little
feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the
dove had disappeared. And as she thought to herself, "In this no man
can help thee," she climbed up to the sun, and said to him, "Thou
shinest into every crevice, and over every peak, hast thou not seen a
white dove flying?" - "No," said the sun, "I have seen none, but I
present thee with a casket, open it when thou art in sorest need." Then
she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon
appeared; she then asked her, "Thou shinest the whole night through,
and on every field and forest, hast thou not seen a white dove
flying?" - "No," said the moon, "I have seen no dove, but here I
give thee an egg, break it when thou art in great need." She thanked
the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then
she said to it, "Thou blowest over every tree and under every leaf,
hast thou not seen a white dove flying?" - "No," said the night wind,
"I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they
have seen it." The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen
nothing, but the south wind said, "I have seen the white dove, it has
flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven
years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the
dragon, however, is an enchanted princess." The night wind then said to
her, "I will advise thee; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some
tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon
with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will
regain their human form. After that, look round and thou wilt see the
griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing thyself, with thy beloved, on to
his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home.
Here is a nut for thee, when thou are above the center of the sea, let
the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will
grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot
rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if thou
forgettest to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea."

Then she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said.
She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the
dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both
of them regained their human shapes. But when the princess, who had
before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the
youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off
with her. There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was
again forsaken. She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and
said, "Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock
crows, until I find him," and she went forth by long, long roads, until
at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together;
there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would
celebrate their wedding, but she said, "God still helps me," and
opened the casket that the sun had given her. A dress lay therein as
brilliant as the sun itself. So she took it out and put it on, and went
up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her
with astonishment. The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought
it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale? "Not
for money or land," answered she, "but for flesh and blood." The
bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said, "Let me sleep a
night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps." The bride would not,
yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the
page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught. When it was night,
therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the
chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said, "I have followed after
thee for seven years. I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four
winds, and have enquired for thee, and have helped thee against the
dragon; wilt thou, then quite forget me?" But the prince slept so
soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside
in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and
had to give up the golden dress. And as that even had been of no avail,
she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept. While she
was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her;
she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens
all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old
hen's wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world! Then
she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride
looked out of the window. The little chickens pleased her so much that
she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale. "Not for
money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in
the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps." The bride said, "Yes,"
intending to cheat her as on the former evening. But when the prince
went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the
night had been? On this the page told all; that he had been forced to
give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in
the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night. The prince
said, "Pour out the draught by the bed-side." At night, she was again
led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he
immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and
cried, "Now I really am released! I have been as it were in a dream,
for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled
to forget thee, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right
time." Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they
feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated
themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when
they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall
nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home,
where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they
lived thenceforth happily until their death.
