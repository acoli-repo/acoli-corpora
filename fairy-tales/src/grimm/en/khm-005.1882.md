## The wolf and the seven young kids 

There was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of
them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the
wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her. "Dear
children," said she, "I am going out into the wood; and while I am
gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get
inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often
disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and
black paws." - "Dear mother," answered the kids, "you need not be
afraid, we will take good care of ourselves." And the mother bleated
good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind.

It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and
crying out: "Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back,
and has brought each of you something." But the little kids knew it was
the wolf by the hoarse voice. "We will not open the door," cried they;
"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your
voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf." Then off went the wolf to a
shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice
soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried:
"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought
each of you something." But the wolf had put up his black paws against
the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, "We will not open the
door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf." The
wolf then ran to a baker. "Baker," said he, "I am hurt in the foot;
pray spread some dough over the place." And when the baker had
plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. "Miller," said he, "strew
me some white meal over my paws." But the miller refused, thinking the
wolf must be meaning harm to some one. "If you don't do it," cried
the wolf, "I'll eat you up!" And the miller was afraid and did as he
was told. And that just shows what men are.

And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. "Open,
children!" cried he. "Your dear mother has come home, and brought you
each something from the wood." - "First show us your paws," said the
kids, "so that we may know if you are really our mother or not." And
he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were
white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was
inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to
hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed,
the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the
cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other
he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case.
And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the
green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.

Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a
sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and
stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the
bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called
to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name
of the youngest. "Here I am, mother," a little voice cried, "here, in
the clock case." And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had
come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the
loss of her dear children.

At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid
with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf
lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother
goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something
inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it
be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still
alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of
shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf's body open, and
no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the
kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little
kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had
swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted
their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. "Now
fetch some good hard stones," said the mother, "and we will fill his
body with them, as he lies asleep." And so they fetched some in all
haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly
again that he was none the wiser.

When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him
feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they
struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:

"What is this I feel inside me
Knocking hard against my bones?
How should such a thing betide me!
They were kids, and now they're stones."

So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones
weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And
when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. "The wolf is
dead, the wolf is dead!" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with
their mother all about the place.
