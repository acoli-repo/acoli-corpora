## A riddling tale 

Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one
of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day
was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the
field and become a flower again, she said to her husband: "If thou wilt
come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth
stay with thee." And he did so. Now the question is, how did her
husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any
difference?

Answer: "As she was at her home during the night and not in the field,
no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew
her."
