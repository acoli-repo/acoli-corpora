# title: The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood

There were formerly a King and a Queen, who were so sorry that they had
no children, so sorry that it cannot be expressed. They went to all the
waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried and all to
no purpose. At last, however, the Queen proved with child, and was
brought to bed of a daughter. There was a very fine christening; and the
Princess had for her godmothers all the Fairies they could find in the
whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them might give her
a gift, as was the custom of Fairies in those days, and that by this
means the Princess might have all the perfections imaginable.

After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company
returned to the King\'s palace, where was prepared a great feast for the
Fairies. There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover
with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife and fork, all
of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting
down at table, they saw come into the hall a very old Fairy whom they
had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out
of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or inchanted.
The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of
gold as the others, because they had seven only made for the seven
Fairies. The old Fairy  fancied she was
slighted, and muttered some threat between her teeth. One of the young
Fairies, who sat by her, overheard how she grumbled; and judging that
she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as
they rose from the table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she
might speak last, and repair, as much as possible she could, the evil
which the old Fairy might intend.

In the mean while all the Fairies began to give their gifts to the
Princess. The youngest gave her for gift, that she should be the most
beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of
an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in every
thing she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; the
fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she
should play upon all kinds of music to the utmost perfection.

The old Fairy\'s turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite
than age, she said, that the Princess should have her hand pierced with
a spindle, and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole
company tremble, and every body fell a-crying.

At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings,
and spake these words aloud:

\"Be reassured, O King and Queen; your daughter shall not die of this
disaster: it is true, I have no power to undo intirely what my elder has
done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but
instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall
last a hundred  years; at the expiration of
which a king\'s son shall come and awake her.\"

The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused
immediately proclamations to be made, whereby every-body was forbidden,
on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle or to have so much
as any spindle in their houses.

About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being gone to
one of their houses of pleasure, the young Princess happened one day to
divert herself running up and down the palace; when going up from one
apartment to another, she came into a little room on the top of a tower,
where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle. This good
woman had never heard of the King\'s proclamation against spindles.

\"What are you doing there, Goody?\" said the Princess.

\"I am spinning, my pretty child,\" said the old woman, who did not know
who she was.

\"Ha!\" said the Princess, \"this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give
it to me, that I may see if I can do so.\" She had no sooner taken the
spindle into her hand, than, whether being very hasty at it, somewhat
unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran into
her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.

The good old woman not knowing very well what to do in this affair,
cried out for help. People came in from
every  quarter in great numbers; they threw
water upon the Princess\'s face, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of
her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but nothing would
bring her to herself.

And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the
prediction of the Fairies, and judging very well that this must
necessarily come to pass, since the Fairies had said it, caused the
Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to
be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver. One would have
taken her for an angel, she was so very beautiful; for her swooning away
had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her cheeks were carnation,
and her lips like coral; indeed her eyes were shut, but she was heard to
breathe softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead.
The King commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep
quietly till her hour of awakening was come.

The good Fairy, who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a
hundred years, was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues
off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly
informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that
is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground at one
stride. The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour
after, in a fiery chariot, drawn by dragons. The King handed her out of
the chariot, and she approved every thing he had done; but, as she had a
very great fore sight, she thought, when
the Princess should awake, she might not know what to do with herself,
being all alone in this old palace; and this was what she did: She
touched with her wand every thing in the palace (except the King and the
Queen), governesses, maids of honour, ladies of the bedchamber,
gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, under-cooks, scullions, guards,
with their beef-eaters, pages, footmen; she likewise touched all the
horses which were in the stables, as well as their grooms, the great
dogs in the outward court, and pretty little Mopsey too, the Princess\'s
little spaniel-bitch, which lay by her on the bed.

Immediately upon her touching them, they all fell asleep, that they
might not awake before their mistress, and that they might be ready to
wait upon her when she wanted them. The very spits at the fire, as full
as they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep, and the
fire likewise. All this was done in a moment. Fairies are not long in
doing their business.

And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without
waking her, went out of the palace, and put forth a proclamation, that
nobody should dare to come near it. This, however, was not necessary;
for, in a quarter of an hour\'s time, there grew up, all round about the
park, such a vast number of trees, great and small, bushes and brambles,
twining one within another, that neither man nor beast could pass
thro\'; so that nothing could be seen but the very top of the towers of
the palace; and that too, not unless  it
was a good way off. Nobody doubted but the Fairy gave herein a sample of
her art, that the Princess, while she continued sleeping, might have
nothing to fear from any curious people.

When a hundred years were gone and past, the son of the King then
reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping
Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked, what
were those towers which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?
Every one answered according as they had heard; some said that it was a
ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits; others, that all the sorcerers
and witches of the country kept there their sabbath, or nights meeting.
The common opinion was that an
Ogre[]{#FNanchor_1_1}[\[1\]](#Footnote_1_1){.fnanchor .pginternal} lived
there, and that he carried thither all the little children he could
catch, that he might eat them up at his leisure, without any-body\'s
being able to follow him, as having himself, only, the power to pass
thro\' the wood.


The Prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very aged
countryman spake to him thus: \"May it please your Royal Highness, it is
now above fifty years since I heard my father, who had heard my
grandfather, say that there then was in this castle, a Princess, the
most beautiful was ever seen; that she must sleep there a hundred years,
and should be awaked by a king\'s son; for whom she was reserved.\" The
young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without a
moment\'s doubt, that he could put an end to this rare adventure; and
pushed on by love and honour resolved that moment to look into it.

Scarce had he advanced towards the wood, when all the great trees, the
bushes and brambles, gave way of themselves to let him pass thro\'; he
walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which
he went into; and what a little surprised him was, that he saw none of
his people could follow him, because the trees closed again, as soon as
he had pass\'d thro\' them. However, he did not cease from continuing
his way; a young and amorous Prince is always valiant. He came into a
spacious outward court, where everything he saw might have frozen up the
most fearless person with horror. There reigned over all a most
frightful silence; the image of death everywhere shewed itself, and
there was nothing to be seen but stretched out bodies of men and
animals, all seeming to be dead. He, however, very well knew, by the
ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beef-eaters, that they were only
asleep; and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine,
shewed plainly, that they fell asleep in their cups.

He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs, and came
into the guard-chamber, where the guards were standing in their ranks,
with their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they
could. After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and
ladies, all asleep, some standing, others sitting. At last he came into
a  chamber all gilded with gold, where he
saw, upon a bed, the curtains of which were all open, the finest sight
was ever beheld: a Princess, who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen
years of age, and whose bright, and in a manner resplendent beauty, had
somewhat in it divine. He approached with trembling and admiration, and
fell down before her upon his knees.

And now, as the inchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and
looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to
admit of: \"Is it you, my Prince,\" said she to him, \"you have tarried
long.\"

The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in
which they were spoken, knew not how to shew his joy and gratitude; he
assured her, that he loved her better than he did himself; his discourse
was not well connected, but it pleased her all the more; little
eloquence, a great deal of love. He was more at a loss than she, and we
need not wonder at it; she had time to think on what to say to him; for
it is very probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the
good Fairy, during so long a sleep, had entertained her with pleasant
dreams. In short, when they talked four hours together, they said not
half what they had to say.

In the mean while, all the palace awaked; every one thought upon their
particular business; and as all of them were not in love, they were
ready to die for hunger; the chief lady of honour, being as sharp set as
other folks, grew very  impatient, and told
the Princess aloud, That supper was served up. The Prince helped the
Princess to rise, she was entirely dressed, and very magnificently, but
his Royal Highness took care not to tell her that she was dressed like
his great grand-mother, and had a point-band peeping over a high collar;
she looked not a bit the less beautiful and charming for all that.

They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and
were served by the Princess\'s officers; the violins and hautboys played
old tunes, but very excellent, tho\' it was now above a hundred years
since they had been played; and after supper, without losing any time,
the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief
lady of honour drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep; the
Princess had no occasion, and the Prince left her next morning to return
into the city, where his father must needs have been anxious on his
account. The Prince told him that he lost his way in the forest, as he
was hunting, and that he had lain at the cottage of a collier, who gave
him cheese and brown bread.

The King his father, who was of an easy disposition, believed him; but
his mother could not be persuaded this was true; and seeing that he went
almost every day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready
when he had laid out three or four nights together, she no longer
doubted he had some little amour, for he lived with the Princess above
two whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest
of  which, who was a daughter, was named
Aurora, and the youngest, who was a son, they called Day, because he was
even handsomer and more beautiful than his sister.

The Queen said more than once to her son, in order to bring him to speak
freely to her, that a young man must e\'en take his pleasure; but he
never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared her, tho\' he loved
her; for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the King would never have
married her, had it not been for her vast riches; it was even whispered
about the court, that she had Ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever
she saw little children passing by, she had all the difficulty in the
world to refrain from falling upon them. And so the Prince would never
tell her one word.

But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterwards;
and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and
he went in great ceremony to fetch his Queen from the castle. They made
a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two
children.

Some time after, the King went to make war with the Emperor
Cantalabutte, his neighbour. He left the government of the kingdom to
the Queen his mother, and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and
children. He was like to be at war all the summer, and as soon as he
departed, the Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law and her children to
a country-house among the woods, that she might with the more ease
gratify her horrible longing. 

Some few days afterwards she went thither herself, and said to her clerk
of the kitchen:

\"I have a mind to eat little Aurora for my dinner to morrow.\"

\"Ah! Madam,\" cried the clerk of the kitchen.

\"I will have it so,\" replied the Queen (and this she spake in the tone
of an Ogress, who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat), \"and will eat
her with a Sauce
Robert.\" 

The poor man knowing very well that he must not play tricks with
Ogresses, took his great knife and went up into little Aurora\'s
chamber. She was then four years old, and came up to him jumping and
laughing, to take him about the neck, and ask him for some sugar-candy.
Upon which he began to weep, the great knife fell out of his hand, and
he went into the back-yard, and killed a little lamb, and dressed it
with such good sauce, that his mistress assured him she had never eaten
anything so good in her life. He had at the same time taken up little
Aurora, and carried her to his wife, to conceal her in the lodging he
had at the end of the court yard.

About eight days afterwards, the wicked Queen said to the clerk of the
kitchen:

\"I will sup upon little Day.\"

He answered not a word, being resolved to cheat her, as he had done
before. He went to find out little Day, and saw
 him with a little foil in his hand, with
which he was fencing with a great monkey; the child being then only
three years of age. He took him up in his arms, and carried him to his
wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along with his sister,
and in the room of little Day cooked up a young kid very tender, which
the Ogress found to be wonderfully good.

This was hitherto all mighty well: but one evening this wicked Queen
said to her clerk of the kitchen:

\"I will eat the Queen with the same sauce I had with her children.\"

It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able to
deceive her. The young Queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the
hundred years she had been asleep: her skin was somewhat tough, tho\'
very fair and white; and how to find in the yard a beast so firm, was
what puzzled him. He took then a resolution, that he might save his own
life, to cut the Queen\'s throat; and going up into her chamber, with
intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great a fury as he could
possibly, and came into the young Queen\'s room with his dagger in his
hand. He would not, however, surprise her, but told her, with a great
deal of respect, the orders he had received from the Queen-mother.

\"Do it, do it,\" said she stretching out her neck, \"execute your
orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom
I so much and so tenderly loved,\" for she 
thought them dead ever since they had been taken away without her
knowledge.

\"No, no, Madam,\" cried the poor clerk of the kitchen, all in tears,
\"you shall not die, and yet you shall see your children again; but it
must be in my lodgings, where I have concealed them, and I shall deceive
the Queen once more, by giving her in your stead a young hind.\"

Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber; where leaving her
to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a
hind, which the Queen had for her supper, and devoured it with the same
appetite, as if it had been the young Queen. Exceedingly was she
delighted with her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the
King, at his return, how ravenous wolves had eaten up the Queen his
wife, and her two children.

One evening, as she was, according to her custom, rambling round about
the courts and yards of the palace, to see if she could smell any fresh
meat, she heard, in a ground-room little Day crying, for his mamma was
going to whip him, because he had been naughty; and she heard, at the
same time, little Aurora begging pardon for her brother.

The Ogress presently knew the voice of the Queen and her children, and
being quite mad that she had been thus deceived, she commanded next
morning, by break of day (with a most horrible voice, which made every
body tremble) that they should bring into the middle of the great court
a large tub, which she caused to be filled with toads,
vipers,  snakes, and all sorts of serpents,
in order to have thrown into it the Queen and her children, the clerk of
the kitchen, his wife and maid; all whom she had given orders should be
brought thither with their hands tied behind them.

They were brought out accordingly, and the executioners were just going
to throw them into the tub, when the King (who was not so soon expected)
entered the court on horse-back (for he came post) and asked, with the
utmost astonishment, what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle? No
one dared to tell him; when the Ogress, all inraged to see what had
happened, threw herself head-foremost into the tub, and was instantly
devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it for
others. The King could not but be very sorry, for she was his mother;
but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife, and his pretty
children.

**The Moral**

To get as prize a husband rich and gay. /
Of humour sweet, with many years to stay, /
Is natural enough, \'tis true; /
To wait for him a hundred years, /
And all that while asleep, appears /
A thing entirely new. /
Now at this time of day, /
Not one of all the sex we see /
Doth sleep with such profound tranquillity: /
But yet this Fable seems to let us know /
That very often Hymen\'s blisses sweet, /
Altho\' some tedious obstacles they meet, /
Are not less happy for approaching slow. /
\'Tis nature\'s way that ladies fair /
Should yearn conjugal joys to share; /
And so I\'ve not the heart to preach /
A moral that\'s beyond their reach.
