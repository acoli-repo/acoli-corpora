# title: Riquet with the Tuft

There was, once upon a time, a Queen, who was brought to bed of a son, so
hideously ugly, that it was long disputed, whether he had human form. A
Fairy, who was at his birth, affirmed, he would be very lovable for all
that, since he should be indowed with abundance of wit. She even added,
that it would be in his power, by virtue of a gift she had just then
given him, to bestow on the person he most loved as much wit as he
pleased. All this somewhat comforted the poor Queen, who was under a
grievous affliction for having brought into the world such an ugly brat.
It is true, that this child no sooner began to prattle, but he said a
thousand pretty things, and that in all his actions there was something
so taking, that he charmed every-body. I forgot to tell you, that he
came into the world with a little tuft of hair upon his head, which made
them call him Riquet with the Tuft, for Riquet was the family name.

Seven or eight years after this, the Queen of a neighbouring kingdom was
delivered of two daughters at a birth. The first-born of these was
beautiful beyond compare, whereat the Queen was so very glad, that those
present were afraid that her excess of joy would do her harm. The same
Fairy, who had assisted at the birth of little Riquet with the Tuft, was
here also; and, to moderate the Queen\'s gladness, she declared, that
this little Princess should have no wit at
all,  but be as stupid as she was pretty.
This mortified the Queen extreamly, but some moments afterwards she had
far greater sorrow; for, the second daughter she was delivered of, was
very ugly.

\"Do not afflict yourself so much, Madam,\" said the Fairy; \"your
daughter shall have so great a portion of wit, that her want of beauty
will scarcely be perceived.\"

\"God grant it,\" replied the Queen; \"but is there no way to make the
eldest, who is so pretty, have some little wit?\"

\"I can do nothing for her, Madam, as to wit,\" answered the Fairy,
\"but everything as to beauty; and as there is nothing but what I would
do for your satisfaction, I give her for gift, that she shall have the
power to make handsome the person who shall best please her.\"

As these Princesses grew up, their perfections grew up with them; all
the public talk was of the beauty of the eldest, and the wit of the
youngest. It is true also that their defects increased considerably with
their age; the youngest visibly grew uglier and uglier, and the eldest
became every day more and more stupid; she either made no answer at all
to what was asked her, or said something very silly; she was with all
this so unhandy, that she could not place four pieces of china upon the
mantlepiece, without breaking one of them, nor drink a glass of water
without spilling half of it upon her cloaths. Tho\' beauty is a very
great advantage in young people, yet here the youngest sister bore away
the bell, almost  always, in all companies
from the eldest; people would indeed, go first to the Beauty to look
upon, and admire her, but turn aside soon after to the Wit, to hear a
thousand most entertaining and agreeable turns, and it was amazing to
see, in less than a quarter of an hour\'s time, the eldest with not a
soul with her and the whole company crowding about the youngest. The
eldest, tho\' she was unaccountably dull, could not but notice it, and
would have given all her beauty to have half the wit of her sister. The
Queen, prudent as she was, could not help reproaching her several times,
which had like to have made this poor Princess die for grief.

One day, as she retired into the wood to bewail her misfortune, she saw,
coming to her, a little man, very disagreeable, but most magnificently
dressed. This was the young Prince Riquet with the Tuft, who having
fallen in love with her, by seeing her picture, many of which went all
the world over, had left his father\'s kingdom, to have the pleasure of
seeing and talking with her.

Overjoyed to find her thus all alone, he addressed himself to her with
all imaginable politeness and respect. Having observed, after he had
made her the ordinary compliments, that she was extremely melancholy, he
said to her:

\"I cannot comprehend, Madam, how a person so beautiful as you are, can
be so sorrowful as you seem to be; for tho\' I can boast of having seen
infinite numbers of ladies exquisitely charming, I can say that I never
beheld any one whose beauty approaches
yours.\" 

\"You are pleased to say so,\" answered the Princess, and here she
stopped.

\"Beauty,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"is such a great advantage,
that it ought to take the place of all things; and since you possess
this treasure, I see nothing that can possibly very much afflict you.\"

\"I had far rather,\" cried the Princess, \"be as ugly as you are, and
have wit, than have the beauty I possess, and be so stupid as I am.\"

\"There is nothing, Madam,\" returned he, \"shews more that we have wit,
than to believe we have none; and it is the nature of that excellent
quality, that the more people have of it, the more they believe they
want it.\"

\"I do not know that,\" said the Princess; \"but I know, very well, that
I am very senseless, and thence proceeds the vexation which almost kills
me.\"

\"If that be all, Madam, which troubles you, I can very easily put an
end to your affliction.\"

\"And how will you do that?\" cried the Princess.

\"I have the power, Madam,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"to give to
that person whom I shall love best, as much wit as can be had; and as
you, Madam, are that very person, it will be your fault only, if you
have not as great a share of it as any one living, provided you will be
pleased to marry me.\"

The Princess remained quite astonished, and answered not a
word. 


\"I see,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"that this proposal makes you
very uneasy, and I do not wonder at it, but I will give you a whole year
to consider of it.\"

The Princess had so little wit, and, at the same time, so great a
longing to have some, that she imagined the end of that year would never
be; therefore she accepted the proposal which was made her. She had no
sooner promised Riquet with the Tuft that she would marry him on that
day twelvemonth, than she found herself quite otherwise than she was
before; she had an incredible facility of speaking whatever she pleased,
after a polite, easy, and natural manner; she began that moment a very
gallant conversation with Riquet with the Tuft, wherein she tattled at
such a rate, that Riquet with the Tuft believed he had given her more
wit than he had reserved for himself.

When she returned to the palace, the whole Court knew not what to think
of such a sudden and extraordinary change; for they heard from her now
as much sensible discourse, and as many infinitely witty turns, as they
had stupid and silly impertinences before. The whole Court was overjoyed
at it beyond imagination; it pleased all but her younger sister; because
having no longer the advantage of her in respect of wit, she appeared,
in comparison of her, a very disagreeable, homely puss. The King
governed himself by her advice, and would even sometimes hold a council
in her apartment. The noise of this change spreading every where, all
the young Princes of the neighbouring kingdoms strove all they
could  to gain her favour, and almost all
of them asked her in marriage; but she found not one of them had wit
enough for her, and she gave them all a hearing, but would not engage
herself to any.

However, there came one so powerful, rich, witty and handsome, that she
could not help having a good inclination for him. Her father perceived
it, and told her that she was her own mistress as to the choice of a
husband, and that she might declare her intentions. As the more wit we
have, the greater difficulty we find to make a firm resolution upon such
affairs, this made her desire her father, after having thanked him, to
give her time to consider of it.

She went accidentally to walk in the same wood where she met Riquet with
the Tuft, to think, the more conveniently, what she ought to do. While
she was walking in a profound meditation, she heard a confused noise
under her feet, as it were of a great many people who went backwards and
forwards, and were very busy. Having listened more attentively, she
heard one say:

\"Bring me that pot\"; another \"Give me that kettle\"; and a third,
\"Put some wood upon the fire.\"

The ground at the same time opened, and she seemingly saw under her
feet, a great kitchen full of cooks, scullions, and all sorts of
servants necessary for a magnificent entertainment. There came out of it
a company of roasters, to the number of twenty, or thirty, who went to
plant themselves in a fine alley of wood, about a very long table, with
their  larding pins in their hands, and
skewers in their caps, who began to work, keeping time, to the tune of a
very harmonious song.

The Princess, all astonished at this sight, asked them who they worked
for.

\"For Prince Riquet with the Tuft,\" said the chief of them, \"who is to
be married to-morrow.\"

The Princess was more surprised than ever, and recollecting that it was
now that day twelvemonth on which she had promised to marry Riquet with
the Tuft, she was like to sink into the ground.

What made her forget this was that, when she made this promise, she was
very silly, and having obtained that vast stock of wit which the Prince
had bestowed on her, she had intirely forgot her stupidity. She
continued walking, but had not taken thirty steps before Riquet with the
Tuft presented himself to her, bravely and most magnificently dressed,
like a Prince who was going to be married.

\"You see, Madam,\" said he, \"I am very exact in keeping my word, and
doubt not, in the least, but you are come hither to perform yours, and
to make me, by giving me your hand, the happiest of men.\"

\"I shall freely own to you,\" answered the Princess, \"that I have not
yet taken any resolution on this affair, and believe I never shall take
such a one as you desire.\"

\"You astonish me, Madam,\" said Riquet with the Tuft.

\"I believe it,\" said the Princess, \"and surely if I had
to  do with a clown, or a man of no wit,
I should find myself very much at a loss. \'A Princess always observes
her word,\' would he say to me, \'and you must marry me, since you
promised to do so.\' But as he whom I talk to is the man of the world
who is master of the greatest sense and judgment, I am sure he will hear
reason. You know, that when I was but a fool, I could, notwithstanding,
never come to a resolution to marry you; why will you have me, now I
have so much judgment as you gave me, and which makes me a more
difficult person than I was at that time, to come to such a resolution,
which I could not then determine to agree to? If you sincerely thought
to make me your wife, you have been greatly in the wrong to deprive me
of my dull simplicity, and make me see things much more clearly than I
did.\"

\"If a man of no wit and sense,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"would
be entitled, as you say, to reproach you for breach of your word, why
will you not let me, Madam, do likewise in a matter wherein all the
happiness of my life is concerned? Is it reasonable that persons of wit
and sense should be in a worse condition than those who have none? Can
you pretend this; you who have so great a share, and desired so
earnestly to have it? But let us come to fact, if you please. Setting
aside my ugliness and deformity, is there any thing in me which
displeases you? Are you dissatisfied with my birth, my wit, humour, or
manners?\"

\"Not at all,\" answered the Princess; \"I love you and respect you in
all that you mention.\" \"If it be so,\" said
 Riquet with the Tuft, \"I am like to be
happy, since it is in your power to make me the most lovable of men.\"

\"How can that be?\" said the Princess.

\"It will come about,\" said Riquet with the Tuft; \"if you love me
enough to wish it to be so; and that you may no ways doubt, Madam, of
what I say, know that the same Fairy, who, on my birth-day, gave me for
gift the power of making the person who should please me extremely witty
and judicious, has, in like manner, given you for gift the power of
making him, whom you love, and would grant that favour to, extremely
handsome.\"

\"If it be so,\" said the Princess, \"I wish, with all my heart, that
you may be the most lovable Prince in the world, and I bestow it on you,
as much as I am able.\"

The Princess had no sooner pronounced these words, but Riquet with the
Tuft appeared to her the finest Prince upon earth; the handsomest and
most amiable man she ever saw. Some affirm that it was not the
enchantments of the Fairy which worked this change, but that love alone
caused the metamorphosis. They say, that the Princess, having made due
reflection on the perseverance of her lover, his discretion, and all the
good qualities of his mind, his wit and judgment, saw no longer the
deformity of his body, nor the ugliness of his face; that his hump
seemed to her no more than the homely air of one who has a broad back;
and that whereas till then she saw him limp horribly, she found it
nothing more than a certain sidling air, which charmed
her.  They say farther, that his eyes,
which were very squinting, seemed to her all the more bright and
sparkling; that their irregularity passed in her judgment for a mark of
a violent excess of love; and, in short, that his great red nose had, in
her opinion, somewhat of the martial and heroic.

Howsoever it was, the Princess promised immediately to marry him, on
condition he obtained her father\'s consent. The King being acquainted
that his daughter had abundance of esteem for Riquet with the Tuft, whom
he knew otherwise for a most sage and judicious Prince, received him for
his son-in-law with pleasure; and the next morning their nuptials were
celebrated, as Riquet with the Tuft had foreseen, and according to the
orders he had a long time before given.

**The Moral**

What in this little Tale we find, /
Is less a fable than real truth. /
In those we love appear rare gifts of mind, /
And body too: wit, judgment, beauty, youth.

**Another**

A countenance whereon, by natures hand, /
Beauty is trac\'d, also the lively stain /
Of such complexion art can ne\'er attain, /
With all these gifts hath not so much command /
On hearts, as hath one secret charm alone. /
Love finds that out, to all besides unknown.
