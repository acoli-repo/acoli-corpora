# title: Cinderilla or The Little Glass Slipper

Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest
and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband,
two daughters of her own humour and they were indeed exactly like her in
all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of
unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her
mother, who was the best creature in the world.

No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over, but the stepmother
began to shew herself in her colours. She could not bear the good
qualities of this pretty girl; and the less, because they made her own
daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work
of the house; she scoured the dishes, tables, &c. and rubbed Madam\'s
chamber, and those of Misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry
garret, upon a wretched straw-bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms,
with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where
they had looking-glasses so large, that they might see themselves at
their full length, from head to foot.

The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who
would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him intirely. When she
had done her work, she used to go  into the
chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her
commonly be called Cinder-breech; but the youngest, who was not so rude
and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderilla. However, Cinderilla,
notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her
sisters, tho\' they were always dressed very richly.

It happened that the King\'s son gave a ball, and invited all persons of
fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited; for they cut a very
grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this
invitation, and wonderfully busy in chusing out such gowns, petticoats,
and head-clothes as might best become them. This was a new trouble to
Cinderilla; for it was she who ironed her sisters\' linen, and plaited
their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should
be dressed. \"For my part,\" said the eldest, \"I will wear my red
velvet suit, with French trimming.\" \"And I,\" said the youngest,
\"shall only have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that,
I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which
is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.\" They sent for
the best tire-woman they could get, to make up their head-dresses, and
adjust their
double-pinners,[]{#FNanchor_3_3}[\[3\]](#Footnote_3_3){.fnanchor
.pginternal} and they had their red brushes, and patches from the
fashionable maker.

Cinderilla was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these
matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the
best, nay and offered her service to dress their heads, which they were
very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:

\"Cinderilla, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\"

\"Ah!\" said she, \"you only jeer at me; it is not for such as I am to
go thither.\"

\"Thou art in the right of it,\" replied they, \"it would make the
people laugh to see a Cinder-breech at a ball.\"

Any one but Cinderilla would have dressed their heads awry, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly well. They were almost two days
without eating, so much they were transported with joy; they broke above
a dozen of laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a
fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At
last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderilla followed
them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of
them she fell a-crying.

Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.

\"I wish I could------, I wish I could---;\" she was not able to speak
the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.

This godmother of hers, who was a Fairy, said to her:

\"Thou wishest thou couldest go to the ball, is it not so?\"

\"Y---es,\" cried Cinderilla, with a great sigh.

\"Well,\" said her godmother, \"be but a good girl, and I will contrive
that thou shalt go.\" Then she took her into her chamber, and said to
her: 

\"Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\"

Cinderilla went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and
brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin
could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside
of it, leaving nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her
wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all
over with gold.

She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice all
alive, and ordered Cinderilla to lift up a little the trap-door, when
giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse
was at that moment turned into a fair horse, which altogether made a
very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-coloured dapple-grey.

Being at a loss for a coachman, \"I will go and see,\" says Cinderilla,
\"if there be never a rat in the rat-trap, that we may make a coachman
of him.\"

\"Thou art in the right,\" replied her godmother; \"go and look.\"

Cinderilla brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge
rats. The Fairy made choice of one of the three, which had the largest
beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat
jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.

After that, she said to her:

\"Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the
watering pot; bring them to me.\" 

She had no sooner done so, but her godmother turned them into six
footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their
liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind
it, as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy then
said to Cinderilla:

\"Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not
pleased with it?\"

\"O yes,\" cried she, \"but must I go thither as I am, in these poison
nasty rags?\"

Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same
instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all
beset with jewels. This done she gave her a pair of
glass-slippers,[]{#FNanchor_4_4}[\[4\]](#Footnote_4_4){.fnanchor
.pginternal} the prettiest in the whole world.

Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother,
above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight, telling
her, at the same time, that if she stayed at the ball one moment longer,
her coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat,
her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before.

 

She promised her godmother, she would not fail of leaving the ball
before midnight; and then away she drove, scarce able to contain herself
for joy. The King\'s son, who was told that a great Princess, whom
nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as
she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the hall, among all the
company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off
dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was every one to
contemplate the singular beauty of this unknown new comer. Nothing was
then heard but a confused noise of,

\"Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!\"

The King himself, old as he was, could not help ogling her, and telling
the Queen softly, \"that it was a long time since he had seen so
beautiful and lovely a creature.\" All the ladies were busied in
considering her clothes and head-dress, that they might have some made
next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine
materials, and as able hands to make them.

The King\'s son conducted her to the most honourable seat, and
afterwards took her out to dance with him: she danced so very
gracefully, that they all more and more admired her. A fine collation
was served up, whereof the young Prince ate not a morsel, so intently
was he busied in gazing on her. She went and sat down by her sisters,
shewing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of
the  oranges and citrons which the Prince
had presented her with; which very much surprised them, for they did not
know her.

While Cinderilla was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock
strike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately made a
curtesy to the company, and hasted away as fast as she could.

Being got home, she ran to seek out her godmother, and after having
thanked her, she said, \"she could not but heartily wish she might go
next day to the ball, because the King\'s son had desired her.\" As she
was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her
two sisters knocked at the door which Cinderilla ran and opened.

\"How long you have stayed,\" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes, and
stretching herself as if she had been just awaked out of her sleep; she
had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went
from home.

\"If thou hadst been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"thou
wouldst not have been tired with it; there came thither the finest
Princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she shewed
us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\" Cinderilla
was transported with joy; she asked them the name of that Princess; but
they told her they did not know it; and that the King\'s son was very
anxious to learn it, and would give all the world to know who she was.
At this Cinderilla, smiling, replied:

\"She must then be very beautiful indeed; Lord! how happy have you been;
could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss 
Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of cloaths which you wear every
day!\"

\"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte, \"lend my cloaths to such a
dirty Cinder-breech as thou art; who\'s the fool then?\"

Cinderilla, indeed, expected some such answer, and was very glad of the
refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it, if her sister had lent
her what she asked for jestingly.

The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderilla,
but dressed more magnificently than before. The King\'s son was always
by her, and never ceased his compliments and amorous speeches to her; to
whom all this was so far from being tiresome, that she quite forgot what
her godmother had recommended to her, so that she, at last, counted the
clock striking twelve, when she took it to be no more than eleven; she
then rose up, and fled as nimble as a deer.

The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of
her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got
home, but quite out of breath, without coach or footmen, and in her
nasty old cloaths, having nothing left her of all her finery, but one of
the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards at the
palace gate were asked if they had not seen a Princess go out; who said,
they had seen nobody go out, but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and
who had more the air of a poor country wench, than a
gentle-woman. 

When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderilla asked them if
they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there. They
told her, Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck
twelve, and with so much haste, that she dropped one of her little glass
slippers, the prettiest in the world, and which the King\'s son had
taken up; that he had done nothing but look at it during all the latter
part of the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with
the beautiful person who owned the little slipper.

What they said was very true; for a few days after, the King\'s son
caused it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her
whose foot this slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to
try it on upon the Princesses, then the duchesses, and all the Court,
but in vain. It was brought to the two sisters, who did all they
possibly could to thrust their feet into the slipper, but they could not
effect it.

Cinderilla, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them
laughing:

\"Let me see if it will not fit me?\"

Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman
who was sent to try the slipper, looked earnestly at Cinderilla, and
finding her very handsome, said it was but just that she should try, and
that he had orders to let every one make tryal. He invited Cinderilla to
sit down, and putting the slipper to her foot, he found it
went  on very easily, and fitted her, as if
it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was
excessively great, but still abundantly greater, when Cinderilla pulled
out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon,
in came her godmother, who having touched, with her wand, Cinderilla\'s
cloaths, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had
before.

And now her two sisters found her to be that fine beautiful lady whom
they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet, to beg
pardon for all the ill treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderilla
took them up, and as she embraced them, cried that she forgave them with
all her heart, and desired them always to love her.

She was conducted to the young Prince, dressed as she was; he thought
her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.

Cinderilla, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters
lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two
great lords of the court.

**The Moral**

Beauty\'s to the sex a treasure, /
Still admir\'d beyond all measure, /
And never yet was any known, /
By still admiring, weary grown. /
But that rare quality call\'d grace, /
Exceeds, by far, a handsome face; /
Its lasting charms surpass the other, /
And this rich gift her kind godmother /
Bestow\'d on Cinderilla fair, /
Whom she instructed with such care. /
She gave to her such graceful mien, /
That she, thereby, became a queen. /
For thus (may ever truth prevail) /
We draw our moral from this tale. /
This quality, fair ladies, know /
Prevails much more (you\'ll find it so) /
T\'ingage and captivate a heart, /
Than a fine head dress\'d up with art. /
The fairies\' gift of greatest worth /
Is grace of bearing, not high birth; /
Without this gift we\'ll miss the prize; /
Possession gives us wings to rise.

**Another**

A great advantage \'tis, no doubt, to man, /
To have wit, courage, birth, good sense, and brain, /
And other such-like qualities, which we /
Receiv\'d from heaven\'s kind hand, and destiny. /
But none of these rich graces from above, /
To your advancement in the world will prove /
If godmothers and sires you disobey, /
Or \'gainst their strict advice too long you stay.
