## The windmill 

A windmill stood upon the hill, proud to look at, and it was proud too.

"I am not proud at all," it said, "but I am very much enlightened
without and within. I have sun and moon for my outward use, and for
inward use too; and into the bargain I have stearine candles, train oil
and lamps, and tallow candles. I may well say that I'm enlightened.
I'm a thinking being, and so well constructed that it's quite
delightful. I have a good windpipe in my chest, and I have four wings
that are placed outside my head, just beneath my hat. The birds have
only two wings, and are obliged to carry them on their backs. I am a
Dutchman by birth, that may be seen by my figure-- a flying Dutchman.
They are considered supernatural beings, I know, and yet I am quite
natural. I have a gallery round my chest, and house-room beneath it;
that's where my thoughts dwell. My strongest thought, who rules and
reigns, is called by others 'The Man in the Mill.' He knows what he
wants, and is lord over the meal and the bran; but he has his companion,
too, and she calls herself 'Mother.' She is the very heart of me. She
does not run about stupidly and awkwardly, for she knows what she wants,
she knows what she can do, she's as soft as a zephyr and as strong as a
storm; she knows how to begin a thing carefully, and to have her own
way. She is my soft temper, and the father is my hard one. They are two,
and yet one; they each call the other 'My half.' These two have some
little boys, young thoughts, that can grow. The little ones keep
everything in order. When, lately, in my wisdom, I let the father and
the boys examine my throat and the hole in my chest, to see what was
going on there,-- for something in me was out of order, and it's well
to examine one's self,-- the little ones made a tremendous noise. The
youngest jumped up into my hat, and shouted so there that it tickled me.
The little thoughts may grow-- I know that very well; and out in the
world thoughts come too, and not only of my kind, for as far as I can
see, I cannot discern anything like myself; but the wingless houses,
whose throats make no noise, have thoughts too, and these come to my
thoughts, and make love to them, as it is called. It's wonderful
enough-- yes, there are many wonderful things. Something has come over
me, or into me,-- something has changed in the mill-work. It seems as if
the one half, the father, had altered, and had received a better temper
and a more affectionate helpmate-- so young and good, and yet the same,
only more gentle and good through the course of time. What was bitter
has passed away, and the whole is much more comfortable." - "The days
go on, and the days come nearer and nearer to clearness and to joy; and
then a day will come when it will be over with me; but not over
altogether. I must be pulled down that I may be built up again; I shall
cease, but yet shall live on. To become quite a different being, and yet
remain the same! That's difficult for me to understand, however
enlightened I may be with sun, moon, stearine, train oil, and tallow. My
old wood-work and my old brick-work will rise again from the dust!" -
"I will hope that I may keep my old thoughts, the father in the mill,
and the mother, great ones and little ones-- the family; for I call them
all, great and little, the company of thoughts, because I must, and
cannot refrain from it." - "And I must also remain 'myself,' with my
throat in my chest, my wings on my head, the gallery round my body; else
I should not know myself, nor could the others know me, and say,
'There's the mill on the hill, proud to look at, and yet not proud at
all.'"

That is what the mill said. Indeed, it said much more, but that is the
most important part.

And the days came, and the days went, and yesterday was the last day.

Then the mill caught fire. The flames rose up high, and beat out and in,
and bit at the beams and planks, and ate them up. The mill fell, and
nothing remained of it but a heap of ashes. The smoke drove across the
scene of the conflagration, and the wind carried it away.

Whatever had been alive in the mill remained, and what had been gained
by it has nothing to do with this story. The miller's family-- one
soul, many thoughts, and yet only one-- built a new, a splendid mill,
which answered its purpose. It was quite like the old one, and people
said, "Why, yonder is the mill on the hill, proud to look at!" But
this mill was better arranged, more according to the time than the last,
so that progress might be made. The old beams had become worm-eaten and
spongy-- they lay in dust and ashes. The body of the mill did not rise
out of the dust as they had believed it would do. They had taken it
literally, and all things are not to be taken literally.
