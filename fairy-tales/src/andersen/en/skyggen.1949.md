## The shadow 

In very hot climates, where the heat of the sun has great power, people
are usually as brown as mahogany; and in the hottest countries they are
negroes, with black skins. A learned man once travelled into one of
these warm climates, from the cold regions of the north, and thought he
would roam about as he did at home; but he soon had to change his
opinion. He found that, like all sensible people, he must remain in the
house during the whole day, with every window and door closed, so that
it looked as if all in the house were asleep or absent. The houses of
the narrow street in which he lived were so lofty that the sun shone
upon them from morning till evening, and it became quite unbearable.
This learned man from the cold regions was young as well as clever; but
it seemed to him as if he were sitting in an oven, and he became quite
exhausted and weak, and grew so thin that his shadow shrivelled up, and
became much smaller than it had been at home. The sun took away even
what was left of it, and he saw nothing of it till the evening, after
sunset. It was really a pleasure, as soon as the lights were brought
into the room, to see the shadow stretch itself against the wall, even
to the ceiling, so tall was it; and it really wanted a good stretch to
recover its strength. The learned man would sometimes go out into the
balcony to stretch himself also; and as soon as the stars came forth in
the clear, beautiful sky, he felt revived. People at this hour began to
make their appearance in all the balconies in the street; for in warm
climates every window has a balcony, in which they can breathe the fresh
evening air, which is very necessary, even to those who are used to a
heat that makes them as brown as mahogany; so that the street presented
a very lively appearance. Here were shoemakers, and tailors, and all
sorts of people sitting. In the street beneath, they brought out tables
and chairs, lighted candles by hundreds, talked and sang, and were very
merry. There were people walking, carriages driving, and mules trotting
along, with their bells on the harness, "tingle, tingle," as they
went. Then the dead were carried to the grave with the sound of solemn
music, and the tolling of the church bells. It was indeed a scene of
varied life in the street. One house only, which was just opposite to
the one in which the foreign learned man lived, formed a contrast to all
this, for it was quite still; and yet somebody dwelt there, for flowers
stood in the balcony, blooming beautifully in the hot sun; and this
could not have been unless they had been watered carefully. Therefore
some one must be in the house to do this. The doors leading to the
balcony were half opened in the evening; and although in the front room
all was dark, music could be heard from the interior of the house. The
foreign learned man considered this music very delightful; but perhaps
he fancied it; for everything in these warm countries pleased him,
excepting the heat of the sun. The foreign landlord said he did not know
who had taken the opposite house-- nobody was to be seen there; and as
to the music, he thought it seemed very tedious, to him most uncommonly
so.

"It is just as if some one was practising a piece that he could not
manage; it is always the same piece. He thinks, I suppose, that he will
be able to manage it at last; but I do not think so, however long he may
play it."

Once the foreigner woke in the night. He slept with the door open which
led to the balcony; the wind had raised the curtain before it, and there
appeared a wonderful brightness over all in the balcony of the opposite
house. The flowers seemed like flames of the most gorgeous colors, and
among the flowers stood a beautiful slender maiden. It was to him as if
light streamed from her, and dazzled his eyes; but then he had only just
opened them, as he awoke from his sleep. With one spring he was out of
bed, and crept softly behind the curtain. But she was gone-- the
brightness had disappeared; the flowers no longer appeared like flames,
although still as beautiful as ever. The door stood ajar, and from an
inner room sounded music so sweet and so lovely, that it produced the
most enchanting thoughts, and acted on the senses with magic power. Who
could live there? Where was the real entrance? for, both in the street
and in the lane at the side, the whole ground floor was a continuation
of shops; and people could not always be passing through them.

One evening the foreigner sat in the balcony. A light was burning in his
own room, just behind him. It was quite natural, therefore, that his
shadow should fall on the wall of the opposite house; so that, as he sat
amongst the flowers on his balcony, when he moved, his shadow moved
also.

"I think my shadow is the only living thing to be seen opposite," said
the learned man; "see how pleasantly it sits among the flowers. The
door is only ajar; the shadow ought to be clever enough to step in and
look about him, and then to come back and tell me what he has seen. You
could make yourself useful in this way," said he, jokingly; "be so
good as to step in now, will you?" and then he nodded to the shadow,
and the shadow nodded in return. "Now go, but don't stay away
altogether."

Then the foreigner stood up, and the shadow on the opposite balcony
stood up also; the foreigner turned round, the shadow turned; and if any
one had observed, they might have seen it go straight into the
half-opened door of the opposite balcony, as the learned man re-entered
his own room, and let the curtain fall. The next morning he went out to
take his coffee and read the newspapers.

"How is this?" he exclaimed, as he stood in the sunshine. "I have
lost my shadow. So it really did go away yesterday evening, and it has
not returned. This is very annoying."

And it certainly did vex him, not so much because the shadow was gone,
but because he knew there was a story of a man without a shadow. All the
people at home, in his country, knew this story; and when he returned,
and related his own adventures, they would say it was only an imitation;
and he had no desire for such things to be said of him. So he decided
not to speak of it at all, which was a very sensible determination.

In the evening he went out again on his balcony, taking care to place
the light behind him; for he knew that a shadow always wants his master
for a screen; but he could not entice him out. He made himself little,
and he made himself tall; but there was no shadow, and no shadow came.
He said, "Hem, a-hem;" but it was all useless. That was very
vexatious; but in warm countries everything grows very quickly; and,
after a week had passed, he saw, to his great joy, that a new shadow was
growing from his feet, when he walked in the sunshine; so that the root
must have remained. After three weeks, he had quite a respectable
shadow, which, during his return journey to northern lands, continued to
grow, and became at last so large that he might very well have spared
half of it. When this learned man arrived at home, he wrote books about
the true, the good, and the beautiful, which are to be found in this
world; and so days and years passed-- many, many years.

One evening, as he sat in his study, a very gentle tap was heard at the
door. "Come in," said he; but no one came. He opened the door, and
there stood before him a man so remarkably thin that he felt seriously
troubled at his appearance. He was, however, very well dressed, and
looked like a gentleman. "To whom have I the honor of speaking?" said
he.

"Ah, I hoped you would recognize me," said the elegant stranger; "I
have gained so much that I have a body of flesh, and clothes to wear.
You never expected to see me in such a condition. Do you not recognize
your old shadow? Ah, you never expected that I should return to you
again. All has been prosperous with me since I was with you last; I have
become rich in every way, and, were I inclined to purchase my freedom
from service, I could easily do so." And as he spoke he rattled between
his fingers a number of costly trinkets which hung to a thick gold
watch-chain he wore round his neck. Diamond rings sparkled on his
fingers, and it was all real.

"I cannot recover from my astonishment," said the learned man. "What
does all this mean?"

"Something rather unusual," said the shadow; "but you are yourself an
uncommon man, and you know very well that I have followed in your
footsteps ever since your childhood. As soon as you found that I have
travelled enough to be trusted alone, I went my own way, and I am now in
the most brilliant circumstances. But I felt a kind of longing to see
you once more before you die, and I wanted to see this place again, for
there is always a clinging to the land of one's birth. I know that you
have now another shadow; do I owe you anything? If so, have the goodness
to say what it is."

"No! Is it really you?" said the learned man. "Well, this is most
remarkable; I never supposed it possible that a man's old shadow could
become a human being."

"Just tell me what I owe you," said the shadow, "for I do not like to
be in debt to any man."

"How can you talk in that manner?" said the learned man. "What
question of debt can there be between us? You are as free as any one. I
rejoice exceedingly to hear of your good fortune. Sit down, old friend,
and tell me a little of how it happened, and what you saw in the house
opposite to me while we were in those hot climates."

"Yes, I will tell you all about it," said the shadow, sitting down;
"but then you must promise me never to tell in this city, wherever you
may meet me, that I have been your shadow. I am thinking of being
married, for I have more than sufficient to support a family."

"Make yourself quite easy," said the learned man; "I will tell no one
who you really are. Here is my hand,-- I promise, and a word is
sufficient between man and man."

"Between man and a shadow," said the shadow; for he could not help
saying so.

It was really most remarkable how very much he had become a man in
appearance. He was dressed in a suit of the very finest black cloth,
polished boots, and an opera crush hat, which could be folded together
so that nothing could be seen but the crown and the rim, besides the
trinkets, the gold chain, and the diamond rings already spoken of. The
shadow was, in fact, very well dressed, and this made a man of him.
"Now I will relate to you what you wish to know," said the shadow,
placing his foot with the polished leather boot as firmly as possible on
the arm of the new shadow of the learned man, which lay at his feet like
a poodle dog. This was done, it might be from pride, or perhaps that the
new shadow might cling to him, but the prostrate shadow remained quite
quiet and at rest, in order that it might listen, for it wanted to know
how a shadow could be sent away by its master, and become a man itself.
"Do you know," said the shadow, "that in the house opposite to you
lived the most glorious creature in the world? It was poetry. I remained
there three weeks, and it was more like three thousand years, for I read
all that has ever been written in poetry or prose; and I may say, in
truth, that I saw and learnt everything."

"Poetry!" exclaimed the learned man. "Yes, she lives as a hermit in
great cities. Poetry! Well, I saw her once for a very short moment,
while sleep weighed down my eyelids. She flashed upon me from the
balcony like the radiant aurora borealis, surrounded with flowers like
flames of fire. Tell me, you were on the balcony that evening; you went
through the door, and what did you see?"

"I found myself in an ante-room," said the shadow. "You still sat
opposite to me, looking into the room. There was no light, or at least
it seemed in partial darkness, for the door of a whole suite of rooms
stood open, and they were brilliantly lighted. The blaze of light would
have killed me, had I approached too near the maiden myself, but I was
cautious, and took time, which is what every one ought to do."

"And what didst thou see?" asked the learned man.

"I saw everything, as you shall hear. But-- it really is not pride on
my part, as a free man and possessing the knowledge that I do, besides
my position, not to speak of my wealth-- I wish you would say you to me
instead of thou."

"I beg your pardon," said the learned man; "it is an old habit, which
it is difficult to break. You are quite right; I will try to think of
it. But now tell me everything that you saw."

"Everything," said the shadow; "for I saw and know everything."

"What was the appearance of the inner rooms?" asked the scholar. "Was
it there like a cool grove, or like a holy temple? Were the chambers
like a starry sky seen from the top of a high mountain?"

"It was all that you describe," said the shadow; "but I did not go
quite in-- I remained in the twilight of the ante-room-- but I was in a
very good position,-- I could see and hear all that was going on in the
court of poetry."

"But what did you see? Did the gods of ancient times pass through the
rooms? Did old heroes fight their battles over again? Were there lovely
children at play, who related their dreams?"

"I tell you I have been there, and therefore you may be sure that I saw
everything that was to be seen. If you had gone there, you would not
have remained a human being, whereas I became one; and at the same
moment I became aware of my inner being, my inborn affinity to the
nature of poetry. It is true I did not think much about it while I was
with you, but you will remember that I was always much larger at sunrise
and sunset, and in the moonlight even more visible than yourself, but I
did not then understand my inner existence. In the ante-room it was
revealed to me. I became a man; I came out in full maturity. But you had
left the warm countries. As a man, I felt ashamed to go about without
boots or clothes, and that exterior finish by which man is known. So I
went my own way; I can tell you, for you will not put it in a book. I
hid myself under the cloak of a cake woman, but she little thought who
she concealed. It was not till evening that I ventured out. I ran about
the streets in the moonlight. I drew myself up to my full height upon
the walls, which tickled my back very pleasantly. I ran here and there,
looked through the highest windows into the rooms, and over the roofs. I
looked in, and saw what nobody else could see, or indeed ought to see;
in fact, it is a bad world, and I would not care to be a man, but that
men are of some importance. I saw the most miserable things going on
between husbands and wives, parents and children,-- sweet, incomparable
children. I have seen what no human being has the power of knowing,
although they would all be very glad to know-- the evil conduct of their
neighbors. Had I written a newspaper, how eagerly it would have been
read! Instead of which, I wrote directly to the persons themselves, and
great alarm arose in all the town I visited. They had so much fear of
me, and yet how dearly they loved me. The professor made me a professor.
The tailor gave me new clothes; I am well provided for in that way. The
overseer of the mint struck coins for me. The women declared that I was
handsome, and so I became the man you now see me. And now I must say
adieu. Here is my card. I live on the sunny side of the street, and
always stay at home in rainy weather." And the shadow departed.

"This is all very remarkable," said the learned man.

Years passed, days and years went by, and the shadow came again. "How
are you going on now?" he asked.

"Ah!" said the learned man; "I am writing about the true, the
beautiful, and the good; but no one cares to hear anything about it. I
am quite in despair, for I take it to heart very much."

"That is what I never do," said the shadow; "I am growing quite fat
and stout, which every one ought to be. You do not understand the world;
you will make yourself ill about it; you ought to travel; I am going on
a journey in the summer, will you go with me? I should like a travelling
companion; will you travel with me as my shadow? It would give me great
pleasure, and I will pay all expenses."

"Are you going to travel far?" asked the learned man.

"That is a matter of opinion," replied the shadow. "At all events, a
journey will do you good, and if you will be my shadow, then all your
journey shall be paid."

"It appears to me very absurd," said the learned man.

"But it is the way of the world," replied the shadow, "and always
will be." Then he went away.

Everything went wrong with the learned man. Sorrow and trouble pursued
him, and what he said about the good, the beautiful, and the true, was
of as much value to most people as a nutmeg would be to a cow. At length
he fell ill. "You really look like a shadow," people said to him, and
then a cold shudder would pass over him, for he had his own thoughts on
the subject.

"You really ought to go to some watering-place," said the shadow on
his next visit. "There is no other chance for you. I will take you with
me, for the sake of old acquaintance. I will pay the expenses of your
journey, and you shall write a description of it to amuse us by the way.
I should like to go to a watering-place; my beard does not grow as it
ought, which is from weakness, and I must have a beard. Now do be
sensible and accept my proposal; we shall travel as intimate friends."

And at last they started together. The shadow was master now, and the
master became the shadow. They drove together, and rode and walked in
company with each other, side by side, or one in front and the other
behind, according to the position of the sun. The shadow always knew
when to take the place of honor, but the learned man took no notice of
it, for he had a good heart, and was exceedingly mild and friendly.

One day the master said to the shadow, "We have grown up together from
our childhood, and now that we have become travelling companions, shall
we not drink to our good fellowship, and say thee and thou to each
other?"

"What you say is very straightforward and kindly meant," said the
shadow, who was now really master. "I will be equally kind and
straightforward. You are a learned man, and know how wonderful human
nature is. There are some men who cannot endure the smell of brown
paper; it makes them ill. Others will feel a shuddering sensation to
their very marrow, if a nail is scratched on a pane of glass. I myself
have a similar kind of feeling when I hear any one say thou to me. I
feel crushed by it, as I used to feel in my former position with you.
You will perceive that this is a matter of feeling, not pride. I cannot
allow you to say thou to me; I will gladly say it to you, and therefore
your wish will be half fulfilled." Then the shadow addressed his former
master as thou.

"It is going rather too far," said the latter, "that I am to say you
when I speak to him, and he is to say thou to me." However, he was
obliged to submit.

They arrived at length at the baths, where there were many strangers,
and among them a beautiful princess, whose real disease consisted in
being too sharp-sighted, which made every one very uneasy. She saw at
once that the new comer was very different to every one else. "They say
he is here to make his beard grow," she thought; "but I know the real
cause, he is unable to cast a shadow." Then she became very curious on
the matter, and one day, while on the promenade, she entered into
conversation with the strange gentleman. Being a princess, she was not
obliged to stand upon much ceremony, so she said to him without
hesitation, "Your illness consists in not being able to cast a
shadow."

"Your royal highness must be on the high road to recovery from your
illness," said he. "I know your complaint arose from being too
sharp-sighted, and in this case it has entirely failed. I happen to have
a most unusual shadow. Have you not seen a person who is always at my
side? Persons often give their servants finer cloth for their liveries
than for their own clothes, and so I have dressed out my shadow like a
man; nay, you may observe that I have even given him a shadow of his
own; it is rather expensive, but I like to have things about me that are
peculiar."

"How is this?" thought the princess; "am I really cured? This must be
the best watering-place in existence. Water in our times has certainly
wonderful power. But I will not leave this place yet, just as it begins
to be amusing. This foreign prince-- for he must be a prince-- pleases
me above all things. I only hope his beard won't grow, or he will leave
at once."

In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large
assembly rooms. She was light, but he was lighter still; she had never
seen such a dancer before. She told him from what country she had come,
and found he knew it and had been there, but not while she was at home.
He had looked into the windows of her father's palace, both the upper
and the lower windows; he had seen many things, and could therefore
answer the princess, and make allusions which quite astonished her. She
thought he must be the cleverest man in all the world, and felt the
greatest respect for his knowledge. When she danced with him again she
fell in love with him, which the shadow quickly discovered, for she had
with her eyes looked him through and through. They danced once more, and
she was nearly telling him, but she had some discretion; she thought of
her country, her kingdom, and the number of people over whom she would
one day have to rule. "He is a clever man," she thought to herself,
"which is a good thing, and he dances admirably, which is also good.
But has he well-grounded knowledge? that is an important question, and I
must try him." Then she asked him a most difficult question, she
herself could not have answered it, and the shadow made a most
unaccountable grimace.

"You cannot answer that," said the princess.

"I learnt something about it in my childhood," he replied; "and
believe that even my very shadow, standing over there by the door, could
answer it."

"Your shadow," said the princess; "indeed that would be very
remarkable."

"I do not say so positively," observed the shadow; "but I am inclined
to believe that he can do so. He has followed me for so many years, and
has heard so much from me, that I think it is very likely. But your
royal highness must allow me to observe, that he is very proud of being
considered a man, and to put him in a good humor, so that he may answer
correctly, he must be treated as a man."

"I shall be very pleased to do so," said the princess. So she walked
up to the learned man, who stood in the doorway, and spoke to him of the
sun, and the moon, of the green forests, and of people near home and far
off; and the learned man conversed with her pleasantly and sensibly.

"What a wonderful man he must be, to have such a clever shadow!"
thought she. "If I were to choose him it would be a real blessing to my
country and my subjects, and I will do it." So the princess and the
shadow were soon engaged to each other, but no one was to be told a word
about it, till she returned to her kingdom.

"No one shall know," said the shadow; "not even my own shadow;" and
he had very particular reasons for saying so.

After a time, the princess returned to the land over which she reigned,
and the shadow accompanied her.

"Listen my friend," said the shadow to the learned man; "now that I
am as fortunate and as powerful as any man can be, I will do something
unusually good for you. You shall live in my palace, drive with me in
the royal carriage, and have a hundred thousand dollars a year; but you
must allow every one to call you a shadow, and never venture to say that
you have been a man. And once a year, when I sit in my balcony in the
sunshine, you must lie at my feet as becomes a shadow to do; for I must
tell you I am going to marry the princess, and our wedding will take
place this evening."

"Now, really, this is too ridiculous," said the learned man. "I
cannot, and will not, submit to such folly. It would be cheating the
whole country, and the princess also. I will disclose everything, and
say that I am the man, and that you are only a shadow dressed up in
men's clothes."

"No one would believe you," said the shadow; "be reasonable, now, or
I will call the guards."

"I will go straight to the princess," said the learned man.

"But I shall be there first," replied the shadow, "and you will be
sent to prison." And so it turned out, for the guards readily obeyed
him, as they knew he was going to marry the king's daughter.

"You tremble," said the princess, when the shadow appeared before her.
"Has anything happened? You must not be ill to-day, for this evening
our wedding will take place."

"I have gone through the most terrible affair that could possibly
happen," said the shadow; "only imagine, my shadow has gone mad; I
suppose such a poor, shallow brain, could not bear much; he fancies that
he has become a real man, and that I am his shadow."

"How very terrible," cried the princess; "is he locked up?"

"Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never recover."

"Poor shadow!" said the princess; "it is very unfortunate for him; it
would really be a good deed to free him from his frail existence; and,
indeed, when I think how often people take the part of the lower class
against the higher, in these days, it would be policy to put him out of
the way quietly."

"It is certainly rather hard upon him, for he was a faithful servant,"
said the shadow; and he pretended to sigh.

"Yours is a noble character," said the princess, and bowed herself
before him.

In the evening the whole town was illuminated, and cannons fired
"boom," and the soldiers presented arms. It was indeed a grand
wedding. The princess and the shadow stepped out on the balcony to show
themselves, and to receive one cheer more. But the learned man heard
nothing of all these festivities, for he had already been executed.
