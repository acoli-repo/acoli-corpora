## The Phoenix bird 

In the Garden of Paradise, beneath the Tree of Knowledge, bloomed a rose
bush. Here, in the first rose, a bird was born. His flight was like the
flashing of light, his plumage was beauteous, and his song ravishing.
But when Eve plucked the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, when she and Adam were driven from Paradise, there fell from the
flaming sword of the cherub a spark into the nest of the bird, which
blazed up forthwith. The bird perished in the flames; but from the red
egg in the nest there fluttered aloft a new one-- the one solitary
Phoenix bird. The fable tells that he dwells in Arabia, and that every
hundred years, he burns himself to death in his nest; but each time a
new Phoenix, the only one in the world, rises up from the red egg.

The bird flutters round us, swift as light, beauteous in color, charming
in song. When a mother sits by her infant's cradle, he stands on the
pillow, and, with his wings, forms a glory around the infant's head. He
flies through the chamber of content, and brings sunshine into it, and
the violets on the humble table smell doubly sweet.

But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone. He wings his way in the
glimmer of the Northern Lights over the plains of Lapland, and hops
among the yellow flowers in the short Greenland summer. Beneath the
copper mountains of Fablun, and England's coal mines, he flies, in the
shape of a dusty moth, over the hymnbook that rests on the knees of the
pious miner. On a lotus leaf he floats down the sacred waters of the
Ganges, and the eye of the Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds
him.

The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? The Bird of Paradise, the holy
swan of song! On the car of Thespis he sat in the guise of a chattering
raven, and flapped his black wings, smeared with the lees of wine; over
the sounding harp of Iceland swept the swan's red beak; on
Shakspeare's shoulder he sat in the guise of Odin's raven, and
whispered in the poet's ear "Immortality!" and at the minstrels'
feast he fluttered through the halls of the Wartburg.

The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? He sang to thee the
Marseillaise, and thou kissedst the pen that fell from his wing; he came
in the radiance of Paradise, and perchance thou didst turn away from him
towards the sparrow who sat with tinsel on his wings.

The Bird of Paradise-- renewed each century-- born in flame, ending in
flame! Thy picture, in a golden frame, hangs in the halls of the rich,
but thou thyself often fliest around, lonely and disregarded, a myth--
"The Phoenix of Arabia."

In Paradise, when thou wert born in the first rose, beneath the Tree of
Knowledge, thou receivedst a kiss, and thy right name was given thee--
thy name, Poetry.
