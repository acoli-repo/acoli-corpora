## The beetle 

The Emperor's horse was shod with gold - a golden shoe on each of its
feet.

And why was he getting golden shoes?

He was a magnificent-looking animal, with slender legs, intelligent
eyes, and a mane that hung down his neck like a soft veil of silk. He
had carried his master through the smoke and flame of battle and heard
the bullets sing and whistle around him; he had kicked and bitten those
about him and done his share of the fighting whenever the enemy
advanced; he had leaped, carrying his master on his back, over the
enemy's fallen horse and had saved the Emperor's red gold crown, saved
the life of the Emperor, which was much more valuable than the red gold;
and that's why the Emperor's horse had golden shoes, a golden shoe on
each of his feet.

And the Beetle came creeping out.

"First the big ones," he said, "and then the little ones; but size
isn't the only thing that does it." Then he stretched out his thin
legs.

"And what do you want?" demanded the Blacksmith.

"Golden shoes," replied the Beetle.

"Why, you must be crazy!" said the Blacksmith. "Do you want golden
shoes, too?"

"Golden shoes," said the Beetle. "I'm just as good as that great
creature that is waited on, currycombed, and brushed, and served with
food and drink. Don't I belong to the imperial stable, too?"

"But why does the horse have golden shoes?" asked the Blacksmith.
"Don't you understand that?"

"Understand? I understand that it is a personal insult to me," said
the Beetle. "It's just done to annoy me, so I'm going out into the
world."

"Get out of here!" said the Blacksmith.

"What a rude person!" said the Beetle as he left the stable. He flew a
little way and presently found himself in a beautiful flower garden, all
fragrant with roses and lavender.

"Isn't it lovely here?" asked one of the little Ladybirds that were
flying about, with black spots on their red shieldlike wings. "How
sweet it smells here and how beautiful it is!"

"I'm used to much better things," said the Beetle. "Do you call this
beautiful? Why, there isn't so much as a manure pile here!"

Then he went on and got into the shadow of a large Gillyflower. A
Caterpillar was crawling along on it.

"How beautiful the world is!" said the Caterpillar. "The sun is so
warm, and everything is so pleasant! And when my time comes and I must
die, as people call it, I'll wake up again, and I'll be a butterfly!"

"What conceit!" said the Beetle. "You fly about like a butterfly,
indeed! I'm from the stable of the Emperor, and no one there, not even
the Emperor's favorite horse - who wears my castoff golden shoes - has
any idea like that! Get wings! Fly! Why, I can fly already!" and then
the Beetle flew away. "I don't really want to be annoyed, and yet I am
annoyed."

Soon afterward he settled on a large lawn. Here he lay quietly for a
while, and then he fell asleep.

My goodness! The rain came down in buckets! The noise woke up the
Beetle, and he wanted to get down into the earth at once, but he
couldn't. He tumbled over; sometimes he was swimming on his stomach,
sometimes on his back, and it was out of the question to try to fly;
would he ever escape from there with his life? So he just lay where he
was and remained lying there.

When the rain had let up a little, and the Beetle had blinked the water
from his eyes, he saw something gleaming white. It was linen that had
been put out there to bleach; he managed to make his way to it and creep
into a fold of the damp cloth. Certainly this place wasn't as
comfortable as the warm stable, but there was nothing better, and so he
stayed there for a whole day and a whole night, while the rain stayed,
too. The next morning he crept out, very much annoyed with the weather.

Two frogs were sitting on the linen, their bright eyes shining with
pleasure.

"What wonderful weather this is!" one of them said. "How refreshing!
And this linen holds the water together so perfectly! My hind legs are
tickling as if I were going to swim."

"I'd like to know," said the other Frog, "whether the swallow, who
flies so far in her many trips to foreign countries, ever finds a better
climate than ours. Such a storm, and such a downpour! You really might
think you were lying in a wet ditch. Anybody that doesn't enjoy this
weather certainly doesn't love his native country!"

"Have you ever been in the Emperor's stable?" asked the Beetle. "The
dampness there is both warm and refreshing. That's what I am used to;
that's the climate for me; but one can't take it along on a journey.
Isn't there a nice hotbed here in the garden, where persons of rank,
like me, can find a place to live and make himself at home?"

But the Frogs either didn't or wouldn't understand him.

"I never ask a question twice," said the Beetle, after he had already
asked three times without getting any answer.

He went on a little farther and bumped against a piece of broken
pottery. It certainly shouldn't have been lying there, but since it was
it gave good shelter. Several families of Earwigs lived here, and they
didn't need very much room; but they liked company. The females were
full of the most devoted mother love, and so each one considered her own
child the most beautiful and clever of all.

"Our son has become engaged!" said one mother. "The sweet, innocent
baby! His greatest ambition is to creep someday into a clergyman's ear!
He's such a lovely boy. And being engaged will keep him out of
mischief. What joy for a mother!"

"Our son," said another mother, "had hardly crept from the egg before
he got into mischief. He's so full of life and spirits he'll run his
horns off! What joy that is for a mother! Isn't that true, Mr.
Beetle?" for she had recognized the stranger by his shape.

"You're both quite right," said the Beetle; so they invited him to
walk in - that is, to come as far as he could under the broken
flowerpot.

"Now you ought to see my little earwig!" observed a third mother, and
a fourth. "They're such lovely children, and so amusing! They never
behave badly, except when they have a stomach-ache, but that happens
pretty often at their age."

Then each mother spoke of her own youngster, and the youngsters joined
in the conversation, and used the little forks in their tails to pull
the Beetle's mustache.

"The little scamps, they're always up to something!" said the
mothers, beaming with maternal love. But the Beetle was bored by all
this, and so he asked how far it was to the nearest hotbed.

"Oh, that's way out in the world, on the other side of the ditch,"
said an Earwig. "I hope none of my children ever goes that far - it
would be the death of me."

"Just the same I'll try to go that far," said the Beetle, and then he
went off without taking any formal leave, for that's considered the
politest thing to do. And by the ditch he met several of his kind - all
Beetles.

"We live here," they said. "And we're very cozy here, too. May we
invite you to step down into this rich soil? The journey must have tired
you out."

"Indeed it has," said the Beetle. "I've been lying on linen out in
the rain, and cleanliness tires me very much. I also have rheumatism in
my wing joints, from standing in a draft under a broken flowerpot. It's
really very relaxing to be among one's own kind again."

"Perhaps you come from the hotbed?" asked the oldest of them.

"Oh, I come from a much higher place," said the Beetle. "I come from
the Emperor's stable, where I was born with golden shoes on! I'm
traveling on a secret mission. You mustn't ask me any questions, for I
won't tell you anything."

And so the Beetle stepped down into the rich soil. There sat three young
lady Beetles, and they tittered because they didn't know what to say.

"They are not engaged yet," said their mother, and then the young lady
Beetles tittered again, this time from embarrassment.

"I have never seen greater beauties even in the Emperor's stables!"
said the traveling Beetle.

"Now don't you spoil my daughters," said the mother, "and please
don't speak to them unless you have serious intentions. But of course
your intentions are honorable, and so I give you my blessing!"

"Hurrah!" cried all the other Beetles at once, and so the Beetle was
engaged. First the engagement, then the wedding; there was nothing to
wait for.

The following day passed pleasantly, and the next was fair enough, but
by the third day it was time to think of food for the wife and perhaps
for children.

"I've let them put something over on me," he said, "and now the only
thing to do is put something over on them in return."

And that he did. Away he went, away all day, and away all night, while
his wife was left a widow.

The other Beetles said that they had taken nothing more than a complete
tramp into the family and now his wife was left a burden on their hands.

"Well, then, she shall be unmarried again," said her mother, "and sit
here among my unmarried daughters. Shame on that disgusting rascal who
deserted her!"

Meanwhile the Beetle had been traveling on, and had sailed across the
ditch on a cabbage leaf. That morning two persons came by, and when they
saw the Beetle they picked him up, turned him over and over, and both
looked very learned - especially one of them, a boy.

"Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and in the black
mountain," he said. "Isn't that in the Koran?" Then he translated
the Beetle's name into Latin and discoursed upon its nature and family
history. The older scholar was opposed to carrying him home, saying they
had just as good a specimen there. This, the Beetle thought, was a very
rude thing to say, consequently he suddenly flew out of the speaker's
hand. As his wings were dry now, he flew a considerable distance and
reached a greenhouse, where he found a sash of the glass roof partly
open, so, with the greatest of ease, he slipped in and buried himself in
the manure.

"It's very comfortable here," he remarked.

Soon he feel asleep and dreamed that the Emperor's horse had fallen
down and that Mr. Beetle had been given its golden shoes, with the
promise that he should have two more.

It was all very charming. And when the Beetle woke up he crept out and
looked around him. What splendor there was in the greenhouse! Great palm
trees were growing high, and the sun made them look transparent. And
beneath them what a riot of green, and blooming flowers, red as fire,
yellow as amber, or white as freshly fallen snow!

"What magnificent plants! How delicious they'll taste when they're
nice and decayed!" said the Beetle. "This is a splendid larder! I am
sure some of my relatives live here; I'll just see if I can find anyone
fit to associate with. I'm proud, and I'm proud of being that way."

So he thought of the dream he had had about the dying horse and the
golden shoes he had won. But suddenly a hand seized the Beetle and
squeezed him and turned him over and over.

The gardener's little son and his playmate had come to the greenhouse
and, seeing the Beetle, had decided to have some fun with him. First he
was wrapped in a vine leaf and then shoved down into a warm trousers
pocket. He squirmed and wriggled, but he got a good squeezing from the
boy's hand. The boy went rapidly toward the great lake at the bottom of
the garden. Here they put the Beetle in an old broken wooden shoe, with
the top part missing. A little stick was placed upright for a mast, and
to this the Beetle was bound with a woolen thread. Now he was a skipper
and had to sail away.

The lake was very large, and to the Beetle it seemed a vast ocean; he
was so amazed at its size that he fell over on his back and kicked out
with all his legs.

The wooden shoe sailed away. The current bore it along, but whenever it
went too far from shore one of the boys would roll up his trousers, go
in after it, and bring it back. However, just as it sailed merrily out
to sea again, the boys were called away, and quite sharply, too, so that
they ran away from the lake, leaving the wooden shoe to its fate. It
drifted away from the shore, farther and farther out; it was a terrible
situation for the Beetle; he couldn't fly, for he was bound tightly to
the mast.

Then a Fly paid him a visit.

"What beautiful weather we're having!" said the Fly. "I'll rest
here; I can take a sun bath here. You're certainly having a nice time
of it!"

"You don't know what you're talking about," replied the Beetle.
"Can't you see I'm tied up?"

"I'm not a prisoner," said the Fly, and promptly flew away.

"Well, now I guess I know the world," the Beetle said. "And it's a
mean place. I'm the only honest person in it. First, they won't give
me my golden shoes, then I have to lie on wet linen and stand in a
draft, and as a climax they hitch a wife to me. Then, when I made a
quick move out into the world, and found out how people live, and how I
ought to live, one of these human puppies comes and ties me up and
leaves me to the mercy of the wild ocean, while the Emperor's horse
prances about proudly in golden shoes. That's what annoys me more than
anything else! But you mustn't expect sympathy in this world! My career
has been very interesting, but what's the good of that, if nobody knows
about it? The world doesn't deserve to know about it, for it should
have given me golden shoes when the Emperor's horse was shod and I
stretched out my feet to be shod, too. If they'd given me golden shoes
I'd have been an honor to the stable. Now the stable has lost me, and
the world has lost me! It's all over!"

But it wasn't all over yet. Some young girls came rowing up in a boat.

"There's an old wooden shoe sailing along over there!" said one of
them.

"And there's a little animal tied fast in it!" said another.

Their boat came quite close to the wooden shoe, and they fished him out
of the water. One of the girls took out a tiny pair of scissors and cut
the woolen thread without hurting the Beetle; and when she stepped on
shore she placed him down on the grass.

"Crawl, crawl, fly, fly away if you can!" she said. "Freedom is a
precious thing!"

And the Beetle flew straight through the open window of a large
building, and there he sank down, tired and exhausted, in the long,
fine, soft mane of the Emperor's favorite horse, which was standing in
the stable where he and the Beetle lived. He clung fast to the mane and
sat there a little while until he had collected himself.

"Here I am sitting on the Emperor's favorite horse! Yes, sitting on
him as his rider! But what am I saying? Oh, yes, now it's clear to me;
yes, it's a good idea and quite right. Why did the horse get golden
shoes, the blacksmith asked me. Now I know the answer. They were given
to the horse on my account!"

That put the Beetle in good spirits again.

"Traveling broadens the mind," he said.

The sun's rays streamed in on him and shone very brightly.

"On the whole, the world isn't so bad, after all!" said the Beetle.
"But you must know how to take it!"

The world was wonderful, because the Emperor's favorite horse had
golden shoes and because the Beetle was its rider.

"Now I am going down to the other beetles and tell them about all the
pleasures I have enjoyed on my trip abroad, and I am going to say that
now I'm going to stay at home until the horse has worn out his golden
shoes."
