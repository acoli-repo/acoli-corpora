## A picture from the ramparts 

It is autumn. We stand on the ramparts, and look out over the sea. We
look at the numerous ships, and at the Swedish coast on the opposite
side of the sound, rising far above the surface of the waters which
mirror the glow of the evening sky. Behind us the wood is sharply
defined; mighty trees surround us, and the yellow leaves flutter down
from the branches. Below, at the foot of the wall, stands a gloomy
looking building enclosed in palisades. The space between is dark and
narrow, but still more dismal must it be behind the iron gratings in the
wall which cover the narrow loopholes or windows, for in these dungeons
the most depraved of the criminals are confined.

A ray of the setting sun shoots into the bare cells of one of the
captives, for God's sun shines upon the evil and the good. The hardened
criminal casts an impatient look at the bright ray. Then a little bird
flies towards the grating, for birds twitter to the just as well as to
the unjust. He only cries, "Tweet, tweet," and then perches himself
near the grating, flutters his wings, pecks a feather from one of them,
puffs himself out, and sets his feathers on end round his breast and
throat. The bad, chained man looks at him, and a more gentle expression
comes into his hard face. In his breast there rises a thought which he
himself cannot rightly analyze, but the thought has some connection with
the sunbeam, with the bird, and with the scent of violets, which grow
luxuriantly in spring at the foot of the wall. Then there comes the
sound of the hunter's horn, merry and full. The little bird starts, and
flies away, the sunbeam gradually vanishes, and again there is darkness
in the room and in the heart of that bad man. Still the sun has shone
into that heart, and the twittering of the bird has touched it.

Sound on, ye glorious strains of the hunter's horn; continue your
stirring tones, for the evening is mild, and the surface of the sea,
heaving slowly and calmly, is smooth as a mirror.
