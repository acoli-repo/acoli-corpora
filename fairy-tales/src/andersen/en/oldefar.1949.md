## Great-Grandfather 

Great-Grandfather was so lovable, wise and good. All of us looked up to
Great-Grandfather. As far back as I can remember, he was really called
"Father's Father," and "Mother's Father" as well, but when my
Brother Frederick's little son came along he was promoted, and got the
title of "Great-Grandfather." He could not expect to go any higher
than that.

He was very fond of us all, but he did not appear to be fond of our
times. "Old times were the good times," he used to say. "Quiet and
genuine they were. In these days there's too much hurrying and turning
everything upside down. The young folk lay down the law, and even speak
about the Kings as if they are their equals. Any ne'er-do-well can sop
a rag in dirty water and wring it out over the head of an honorable
man."

Great-Grandfather would get angry and red in the face when he talked of
such things, but soon he would smile his kindly, sympathetic smile, and
say, "Oh, well! I may be a bit wrong. I belong to the old days, and I
can't quite get a foothold in the new. May God guide us and show us the
right way to go."

When Great-Grandfather got started on the old days, it seemed to me as
if they came back. I would imagine myself riding along in a gilded
coach, with footmen in fine livery. I saw the guilds move their signs
and march in procession with their banners aloft, preceded by music. And
I attended the merry Christmas festivities, where people in fancy dress
played games of forfeit.

True enough, in the old days dreadfully cruel and horrible things used
to be done. There was torture, rack and wheel, and bloodshed, but even
these horrible things had an excitement about them that fascinated me.
But I also thought of many pleasant things. I used to imagine how things
were when the Danish nobility freed the peasants, and when the Danish
Crown Prince abolished slave trading. It was marvelous to hear
Great-Grandfather talk of all these things, and to hear him tell of the
days of his youth. But I think the times even earlier than that were the
very best times of all - so mighty and glorious.

"They were barbarous times," Brother Frederick said. "Thank heaven we
are well rid of them." He used to say this right out to
Great-Grandfather. This was most improper, I know, but just the same I
always had great respect for Frederick. He was my oldest brother, and he
used to say he was old enough to be my father - but then he was always
saying the oddest things. He had graduated with the highest honors, and
was so quick and clever in his work at Father's office that Father
meant to make him a partner before long. Of us all, he was the one with
whom Great-Grandfather talked most, but they always began to argue, for
they did not get along well together. They did not understand each
other, those two, and the family said they never would, but even as
young as I was, I soon felt that they were indispensable to each other.
Great-Grandfather would listen with the brightest look in his eyes while
Frederick spoke of or read aloud about scientific progress, and new
discoveries in the laws of nature, and about all the other marvels of
our times.

"The human race gets cleverer, but it doesn't get better,"
Great-Grandfather would say. "People invent the most terrible and
harmful weapons with which to kill and injure each other."

"Then the war will be over that much sooner," Frederick would tell
him. "No need now for us to wait seven years for the blessings of
peace. The world is full-blooded, and it needs to be bled now and then.
That is a necessity."

One day Frederick told him of something that actually happened in a
small country and in our own times. The mayor's clock - the large one
on the town hall - kept time for the whole town and for everyone who
lived there. The clock did not run very well, but that didn't matter
nor did it keep anyone from looking to it for the time. But by and by
railroads were built in that country, and in all countries railroads run
by the clock. One must therefore be sure of the time, and know it
exactly, or there will be collisions. At the railroad station they had a
clock that was absolutely reliable, and exactly in accord with the sun.
But as the mayor's was not, everyone went by the railroad clock.

I laughed, and thought the story a funny one, but Great-Grandfather did
not laugh. He became very serious.

"There is a profound meaning in what you have told me," he declared,
"and I understood the thought that prompted you to tell me the story.
There's a moral in the clockwork. It reminds me of another clock - my
parents' simple, old-fashioned Bornholm clock, with lead weights. It
measured out the time of their lives and of my childhood. Perhaps it
didn't run any too well, but it ran just the same. We would look at the
hour hand and believe in it, with never a thought about the works
inside. In those days the machinery of government was like that old
clock. Everybody believed in it and only looked at the hour hand. Now
government machinery is like a clock in a glass case, so that one can
look directly into the works and see the wheels turning and whizzing
around. Sometimes we become quite frightened over this spring or that
wheel, and then I wonder how it is possible for all these complicated
parts to tell the right time. I have lost my childish belief in the
rightness of the old clock. That is the weakness of this age."

Great-Grandfather would talk on until he became quite angry. He and
Frederick could not agree, yet they could not bear to be separated -
"just like old times and new." Both of them felt this - and so did our
whole family - when Frederick was to set out on his journey to far-away
America. It was on business for the Company, so the journey had to be
made. To Great-Grandfather, it was a sad parting, and it seemed a long,
long journey - all the way across a great ocean, and to the other side
of the globe.

"You shall get a letter from me every fortnight," Frederick promised.
"And faster than any letter can go, you shall hear from me by
telegraph. The days will be like hours, and the hours like minutes."

By telegraph we received Frederick's greeting to us from England, just
as he boarded the steamship. Sooner than any letter could reach us, even
though the swift sailing clouds had been our postman, came greetings
from America, where Frederick had landed only a few hours before.

"What a glorious and divine inspiration has been granted our age,"
said Great-Grandfather. "It is a true blessing to the human race."

"And it was in our country," I said, "that the natural principle
underlying the telegraph was first understood and stated. Frederick told
me so."

"Yes," Great-Grandfather said, and he kissed me. "Yes, and I once
looked into the kindly eyes that were the first to see and understand
this marvelous law of nature - his were the eyes of a child, like
yours - and I have shaken his hand." Then he kissed me again.

More than a month had gone by, when a letter came from Frederick with
the news that he was engaged to a beautiful and lovable young lady. He
was sure that everyone in our family would be delighted with her, and he
sent us her photograph. We looked at it first with our bare eyes, and
then with a magnifying glass, for the advantage of photographs is not
only that they stand close inspection through the strongest glass, but
that then you see the full likeness even better. No painter has ever
been able to do that, even in the greatest of the ages past.

"If only this discovery had been made earlier, then we could have seen
the world's greatest and most illustrious men, face to face. How gentle
and good this young girl looks," Great-Grandfather said, and stared
through the glass.

"Now I know her face, and I shall recognize her the moment she comes in
the door."

But that very nearly failed to happen. Fortunately, at home we did not
hear of the danger until it had passed.

After a safe and pleasant trip, the young couple reached England. From
there, they were to come by steamship to Copenhagen. When they came in
sight of the Danish coast- the white sand dunes along the western shore
of Jutland - a heavy sea arose and dashed the ship against the shore.
The enormous waves threatened to break the grounded ship in pieces.

No lifeboat could reach them. Night fell, but out of the darkness burst
a brightly flashing rocket from the shore. It shot far out over the
grounded ship, and brought a line to those on board. Once this
connection between ship and shore was made fast, a rescue buoy was
carefully drawn through the rough, tumultuous sea, to the shore. In it
was a lovely young woman, safe and sound, and marvelously happy when she
and her young husband again stood together on the shore. Every soul on
board was saved before the break of day.

Here in Copenhagen we were sound asleep, dreaming neither of grief nor
of danger. When we were gathered at the breakfast table, we heard a
rumor that an English steamship had been wrecked on the west coast. We
grew heartsick with anxiety, but within an hour we received a telegram
from those who were dear to us. Frederick and his young bride were
saved - they would soon be with us.

Everyone cried, and I cried too. Great-Grandfather cried and clasped his
hands. I am sure he gave thanks for the age in which we live, for that
very day he gave two hundred dollars toward raising a monument to Hans
Christian Oersted. When Frederick came home with his bride, and heard of
it, he said, "That was right, Great-Grandfather. Now let me read to you
what Oersted wrote, a great many years ago, about the old times and the
new."
