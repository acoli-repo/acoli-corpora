## Two maidens 

Have you ever seen "a maiden"? I am referring to what road pavers call
a "maiden," a thing used for ramming down the paving stones. "She"
is made entirely of wood, broad at the bottom, with iron hoops around
it, and a stick run through it at the upper, narrower end, which gives
the maiden arms.

Two maidens like this were once standing in the yard shed, among
shovels, measuring tapes, and wheelbarrows. Now, there was a rumor going
around that they were no longer to be called "maidens," but "stamps"
or "hand rammers"; and this is the newest and only correct term in
road pavers' language for what we all in olden times called "a
maiden."

There are among us human beings certain individuals we call
"emancipated women," such as institution superintendents, midwives,
ballet dancers, milliners, and nurses; and with this group of
"emancipated," the two "maidens" in the yard shed associated
themselves. They were known as "maidens" among the road pavers and
would under no circumstances give up their good old name and let
themselves be called "stamps" or "hand rammers."

Maiden is a human name," they said, "but a 'stamp' or a 'hand
rammer' is a thing, and we certainly do not want to be called things;
that's insulting us!"

"My betrothed is liable to break off our engagement," said the younger
of the two, who was engaged to a ramming block, a large machine used to
drive stakes into the ground. In fact, he did on a larger scale the same
sort of work that she did on a smaller. "He'll take me as a
'maiden,' but I'm sure he won't have me as a 'stamp' or ' hand
rammer,' and so I'll not permit them to change my name."

"As for me, I'd just as soon have both my arms broken off!" said the
elder.

But the wheelbarrow had a different idea, and the wheelbarrow was really
somebody! He considered himself a quarter of a carriage because he went
about on one wheel. "I must, however, tell you that it's common enough
to be called 'maidens'; that isn't nearly so distinctive a name as
'stamp,' because that belongs under the category of 'seals.' Just
think of the 'royal signet,' and the 'seal of the state.' If I were
you I would give up the name 'maiden.' "

"Never!" said the elder. "I'm much too old for that!"

"You don't seem to understand what is called the European necessity,"
said the honest old measuring tape. "People have to adapt themselves to
circumstances, limit themselves, give in to the needs of the times. And
if there is a law that the 'maidens' are to be called 'stamps' or
'hand rammers,' then by that new name she must be called. There is a
measuring tape for everything."

"Well, if there must be a change," said the younger, "I'd rather be
called 'miss,' for 'miss' reminds one a little of 'maiden.' "

"But I'd rather be chopped up for firewood than change at all," said
the old "maiden."

Now it was time for work. The "maidens" rode; they were put in the
wheelbarrow, which was respectful treatment, but they were now called
"stamps."

"Maid--!" they cried as they stamped on the paving stones.
"Maid--!" They almost said the whole word "maiden," but they
didn't finish; they had decided not to say any more about it. But among
themselves they always spoke of each other as "maidens," and praised
the good old days when things were called by their proper names and
those who were "maidens" were called "maidens."

And "maidens" they both remained, for the ramming block, the big
machine I told you about, did break off his engagement with the younger;
he would have nothing to do with a "stamp" or "hand rammer"!
