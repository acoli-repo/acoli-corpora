## The comet 

Now there came a comet with its shiny nucleus and its menacing tail.
People from the great castles and people from the poor huts gazed at it.
So did the crowd in the street, and so did the man who went his solitary
way across the pathless heath. Everyone had his own thoughts. "Come and
look at the omen from heaven. Come out and see this marvelous sight,"
they cried, and everyone hastened to look.

But a little boy and his mother still stayed inside their room. The
tallow candle was burning and the mother thought she saw a bit of
wood-shaving in the light. The tallow formed a jagged edge around the
candle, and then it curled. The mother believed these were signs that
her son would soon die. The wood-shaving was circling toward him. This
was an old superstition, but she believed it. The little boy lived many
more years on earth. Indeed he lived to see the comet return sixty years
later.

The boy did not see the wood-shaving in the candle-light, and his
thoughts were not about the comet which then, for the first time in his
life, shone brightly in the sky. He sat quietly with an earthenware bowl
before him. The bowl was filled with soapy water, into which he dipped
the head of a clay pipe. Then he put the pipe stem in his mouth, and
blew soap bubbles, large and small. They quivered and spun in beautiful
colors. They changed from yellow to red, and from red to purple or blue
and then they turned bright green, like leaves when the sun shines
through them.

The boy's mother said, "May God grant you many more years on earth -
as many years as the bubbles you are blowing."

"So many, so many!" he cried. "I can never blow all the soapy water
into bubbles. There goes one year, there goes another one; see how they
fly!" he exclaimed, as bubbles came loose from his pipe and floated
away. A few of them blew into his eye, where they burned, and smarted,
and made his tears flow. In every bubble he saw a picture of the future,
glimmering and glistening.

"This is the time to look at the comet," cried their neighbors. "Come
outdoors. Don't sit in your room."

The mother took her boy by the hand. He had to put aside his clay pipe,
and stop playing with the soap bubbles, because there was a comet to
see.

The boy saw the bright ball of fire, with its shining tail. Some said it
was three yards long, while others insisted it was several million yards
long - such a difference.

Most of the people who said these things were dead and buried when the
comet came again. But the little boy, toward whom the wood-shaving had
circled, and of whom his mother thought, "He will soon die," still
lived on, though he had grown old and his hair was white. "White hairs
are the flowers of age," the saying goes, and he had many such flowers.
He was an old schoolmaster. The school children thought him very wise
and learned, because he knew history, and geography, and all there is to
be known about the heavens and the stars.

"Everything comes again," he said. "If you will pay attention to
people and events, you will learn that they always come back. There may
be a hundred years between, or many hundreds of years, but once again we
shall see the same character, in another coat and in another country."
And the schoolmaster then told them about William Tell, who was forced
to shoot an apple from his son's head, but before he shot the arrow he
hid another one in his shirt, to shoot into the heart of the wicked
Gessler. This happened in Switzerland. But many years before, the same
thing happened in Denmark to Palnatoke. He too was forced to shoot an
apple from his son's head, and he too hid an arrow in his shirt to
avenge the cruelty. And more than a thousand years before that, the same
story was written in Egypt. It happened before and will happen again,
just as sure as the comet returns. "Off it flies into space, and is
gone for years, but still it comes back." He spoke of the comet that
was expected, the same comet he had seen as a boy.

The schoolmaster knew what went on in the skies, and he thought much
about it too, but he did not neglect history and geography. His garden
was laid out in the shape of a map of Denmark. In it grew herbs and
flowers which flourished in different parts of the land.

"Fetch me peas," he said, and they went to the garden bed that
represented Laaland. "Fetch me buckwheat," he said, and they fetched
it from Langeland. Lovely blue gentian was planted in Skagen, and the
shining Christthorn in Silkeborg. Towns and cities were marked with
small statues. Here was the dragon and St. Knud, who stood for Odense.
Absalon with the bishop's staff stood for Sor√∂. The little boat with
oars marked the site of Aarhus. In the schoolmaster's garden you could
learn the geography of Denmark, but first you had to be instructed by
him and that was a pleasure.

Now that the comet was expected again, he told about it, and he told
what people had said in the old days when it last was seen. They had
said that a comet year was a good year for wine, and that water could be
mixed with this wine without being detected. Therefore the wine
merchants thought well of a comet year.

For fourteen days and fourteen nights the sky was clouded over. They
could not see the comet, and yet it was there. The old schoolmaster sat
in his little chamber next to the schoolroom. The old Bornholm clock of
his grandfather's time stood in the corner, though its heavy lead
weights moved neither up nor down, nor did its pendulum ever swing. The
little cuckoo, that used to come out to call the passing hours, had long
ago stopped doing his duty. The clock neither struck nor ticked. The
clock was decidedly out of order.

But the old clavichord at which he sat had been made in his parents'
time, and it still had a tune or two left in it. The strings could still
play. Tremulous though they were, they could play for him the melodies
of a whole lifetime. As the old man heard them, he remembered many
things, both pleasant and sad, that had happened in the long years which
had gone by since he was a little boy and saw the comet. Now that the
comet had come again, he remembered what his mother had said about the
wood-shaving circling toward him. He remembered the fine soap bubbles he
had blown, one for every year of his life he had said as he looked at
them glistening and gleaming in wonderful colors. He saw in them all his
pleasures and sorrow - everything, both the good and the bad. He saw the
child at his play, and the youth with his fancies. His whole life,
iridescent and bright, floated before his eyes. And in that splendor he
saw his future too, in bubbles of time to come.

First the old man heard from the strings of the clavichord the melodies
of times past, and saw the bubbles of years gone by, colored with
memories. He heard his grandmother's knitting song:

"Surely no Amazon
The first stockings knit."
And then the strings played the songs his old nurse used to sing for
him:

"There were so many dangers
In this world to pass through
For people who were young
And only little knew."
Now the melodies of his first ball were playing, for the minuet and
molinasky - soft melancholy tunes that brought tears to the old man's
eyes. A roaring war-march, then a psalm, then happy tunes. The years
whirled past as if they were those bubbles he blew when he was a little
boy.

His eyes were turned towards the window. A cloud billowed across the
sky, and as it passed he saw the comet with its shining nucleus and its
shining, misty veil. It seemed to him as though it were only yesterday
evening when he had last seen that comet, yet a whole busy lifetime lay
between that evening and this. Then he was a child, looking through
bubbles into the future; now those bright bubbles were all behind him.
Once more he had a child's outlook and a child's faith. His eyes
sparkled, and his hands struck the keys. There was the sound of a
breaking string.

"Come out and see," cried his neighbors. "The comet is here, and the
sky is clear. Come out and look!"

The old schoolmaster did not answer. He had gone where he could see more
clearly. His soul was on a journey far greater than the comet's, and
the realm to which it went was far more spacious than that in which the
comet moved.

Again the comet was seen from the high castle and from the lowly hut.
The crowd in the street gazed up at it, and so did the man who went his
solitary way across the pathless heath. But the schoolmaster's soul was
seen by God, and by those dear ones who had gone before him, and whom he
longed to see.
