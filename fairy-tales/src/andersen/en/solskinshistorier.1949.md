## Sunshine stories 

"I'll tell you a story," said the wind. "Kindly remember," said the
Rain, "that it's my turn to talk. You've been howling around the
corner at the top of your voice quite long enough."

"Is that the thanks I get for all of the favors I've done you?" the
Wind blustered. "Many an umbrella I've turned inside out, or even
blown to tatters, when people tried to avoid you."

"Be silent! It is I who shall speak," said the Sunshine, who spoke
with such brilliance and warmth that the weary Wind fell flat on his
back, and the Rain shook him and tried to rouse him, crying: "We won't
stand for it. This Madam Sunshine is forever interrupting us. Don't
lets listen to her. What she says is not worth hearing."

And the Sunshine began: "A beautiful swan flew over the rolling,
tossing waves of the ocean. Each of its feathers shone like gold. One
feather drifted down above a great merchant ship that sailed the sea
with all its canvas spread. The feather came to rest upon the curly hair
of a young overseer who looked after the goods aboard that ship -
supercargo they called him. The bird of fortune's feather touched his
forehead, became a quill pen in his hand, and brought him such luck that
he soon became a merchant, a man of wealth, a man so rich that he could
wear spurs of gold and change a golden dish into a nobleman's shield. I
know - I have shone on it," said the Sunshine.

"The swan flew far away, over a green meadow where a little shepherd
boy, not more than seven years old, lay in the shade of an old tree, the
only tree in that meadow. As the swan flew past it, she brushed one leaf
from the tree. This leaf fell into the boy's hands, where it turned
into three leaves, ten leaves - yes, it turned into all the leaves of a
book. In this book he read of the many wonderful things that are in
nature, about his native language, about faith, and about knowledge.
Before he went to sleep he laid the book under his pillow to keep from
forgetting what he had learned during the day. The wonderful book led
him first to school, and then far into the fields of learning. I have
seen his name where they carve the names of great scholars," the
Sunshine said.

"The swan flew over the forest, where it was lonely and quiet. She came
to rest on a deep blue lake, where the water lilies grow, where wild
apple trees flourish along the shore, and where the cuckoo and wild
pigeon make their nests.

"A poor woman was in the forest, gathering fallen branches. She carried
them on her back, and held a baby in her arms. She saw the golden swan,
that bird of fortune, rise from the rush-covered shore. What was this
glittering thing the swan had left? It was a golden egg, still warm. She
put it in her bosom, and the warmth stayed in it. Truly there was life
in that egg. Yes, she heard a tapping inside the shell, but it was so
faint that she mistook it for the sound of her own heartbeat.

"When she came home to her own poor cottage, she took the egg out to
look at it. 'Tick,' it said, 'tick,' as if it had been a costly gold
watch. But it was no watch. It was an egg, just about to hatch. The
shell cracked open, and a dear little baby swan looked out. It was fully
feathered, all in gold, and around its neck were four gold rings. As the
poor woman had four boys - three at home and the baby she had carried in
her arms - she knew that one of the rings was meant for each of her
sons. As soon as she realized this, the little golden bird flew away.
She kissed all of the rings, and she made each son kiss one of them,
touch it against his heart, and wear it on his finger. I saw all this,"
said the Sunshine, "and I saw what came of it.

"As one of the boys played in the bed of a stream, he picked up a
handful of clay. He turned it, and twisted it, and he shaped it in his
fingers until he had made a statue of Jason. Like Jason, the young
sculptor had found the golden fleece he sought.

"The second boy ran across the meadow, where there were flowers of
every hue. He gathered a handful, and squeezed them so tightly that the
colored juices wet his ring and splashed in his eye. They stuck to his
fingers and colored his thoughts. The days went by, and the years went
past, until people in the big city came to speak of him as 'the great
painter.'

"The third boy clenched his ring in his teeth so tightly that it echoed
the song that lay deep in his heart. The things he thought and the
things he felt were turned to music. The rose like singing swans, and
like swans they plunged down as deep as the depths of the sea, 'the
deep Sea of Thoughts.' He became a great musician, a great composer of
whom every land has the right to say: 'He belongs to me.'

"The fourth boy - the baby - was an outcast. They said he had the pip,
and that like a sick little chicken he should be dosed with butter and
pepper. They gave him pepper enough with his butter, but I gave him
warmth and the kiss of the sun," said the Sunshine. "He got ten kisses
for one that the other children received. He was a poet, who met with a
blow and a kiss, all his life long. But he had something that no one
could take from him. He had the ring of fame from the golden swan of
fortune. There were golden wings to his thoughts. Up they flew and away
they went, like golden butterflies, which are the symbol of things
immortal."

"What an extremely long story," said the Wind.

"And so awfully dull," the Rain agreed. "Fan me, if you please, so I
may revive a little."

The Wind blew again, and the Sunshine said: "The swan of fortune flew
over the deep gulf, where fishermen spread their nets. The poorest of
the fishermen thought of getting married, and marry he did. And to him
the swan brought a lump of amber. Amber has the power to draw things to
it, and it drew the hearts to the fisherman's home. Amber makes the
most wonderful incense, and there came a fragrant air as from a church,
like a balmy breeze from God's nature. So the fisherman and his bride
were happy and thankful in their quiet home. They were content with what
little they had, and their life became a complete sunshine story."

"I think," said the Wind, "that these stories should stop. The
Sunshine has talked long enough, and I am very bored."

"So am I," said the Rain.

And what do we others who knew this story say?

We say: "Now it's out."
