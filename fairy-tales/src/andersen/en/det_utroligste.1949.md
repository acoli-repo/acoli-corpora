## The most incredible thing 

Whosoever could do the most incredible thing was to have the King's
daughter and half of his kingdom.

The young men, yes, and the old ones too, bent their heads, their
muscles, and their hearts upon winning. To do what they thought was the
most incredible thing, two ate themselves to death, and one died of
overdrinking. Even the boys in the street practiced spitting on their
own backs, which they supposed was the most incredible thing anyone
could do.

On a certain day there was to be an exhibition of things most incredible
and everyone showed his best work. Judges were appointed, ranging from
children of three to old men of ninety. It was a grand exposition of
things out of the ordinary, but everybody promptly agreed that most
incredible of all was a great hall clock - an extraordinary contraption,
outside and in.

When the clock struck, out came lifelike figures to tell the hour. There
were twelve separate performances of these moving figures, with speaking
and singing. People said that nothing so incredible had ever before been
seen.

The clock struck one, and there stood Moses on the mountain, writing in
the tablets of the law the first great commandment: "There is only one
true God." The clock struck two, and there were Adam and Eve, just as
they first met in the Garden of Eden. Were ever two people so lucky!
They didn't own so much as a clothes-closet, and they didn't need one.
At the stroke of three the three Holy Kings appeared. One was as black
as a coal, but he couldn't help that. The sun had blackened him. These
kings brought incense and precious gifts. When the stroke of four
sounded, the seasons advanced in their order. Spring carried a budding
bough of beech, on which a cuckoo sang. Summer had for her sign a
grasshopper on a ripening ear of wheat. Autumn had only an empty
stork's nest, for the birds had flown away. Winter's tame crow perched
on the corner of the stove, and told old tales of bygone days. At five
o'clock there was a procession of the five senses. Sight was
represented by a man who made spectacles. Hearing was a noisy
coppersmith. Smell was a flower girl with violets for sale. Taste came
dressed as a cook. Feeling was a mourner, with crape down to his heels.
As the clock struck six, there sat a gambler, throwing dice for the
highest cast of all, and they fell with the sixes up. Then came the
seven days of the week, or they might be the seven deadly sins. People
could not be sure which they were, for they were not easy to
distinguish. Next came a choir of monks, to sing the eight o'clock
evensong. At the stroke of nine, the nine muses appeared. One was an
astronomer, one kept the books of history, and the others were connected
with the theater. Ten o'clock struck, and Moses came forth again, this
time with the tables in which were written all ten of God's
commandments. When the clock struck again, boys and girls danced out.
They played and sang this song:

"All the way to heaven
The clock struck eleven."
And eleven it struck. Then came the stroke of twelve. Out marched the
night watchman, wearing his cap and carrying his morning star - which is
a truncheon tipped with spikes. He sang the old watch song:

"'Twas at the midnight hour
Our Savior He was born-"
and as he sang the roses about him unfolded into the heads of angels,
with rainbow-tinted wings.

It was good to hear. It was charming to see. The whole thing was a work
of extraordinary craftsmanship, and everyone agreed that it was the most
incredible thing. The artist who had made it was young, generous, and
sincere, a true friend, and a great help to his poor father and mother.
He was altogether worthy of the Princess and of half the kingdom.

On the day that they were to proclaim who had won, the whole town was
bedecked and be-draped. The Princess sat on her throne. It had been
newly stuffed with horsehair for the occasion, but it was still far from
comfortable or pleasant. The judges winked knowingly at the man they had
chosen, who stood there so happy and proud. His fortune was made, for
had he not done the most incredible thing!

"No!" a tall, bony, powerful fellow bawled out. "Leave it to me, I am
the man to do the most incredible thing," and then he swung his ax at
the craftsman's clock. Crack, crash, smash! There lay the whole thing.
Here rolled the wheels, and there flew the hairsprings. It was wrecked
and ruined. "I did that," said the lout. "My work beat his, and
bowled you over, all in one stroke. I have done the most incredible
thing."

"To destroy such a work of art!" said the judges. "Why it's the most
incredible thing we've ever seen." And the people said so too. So he
was awarded the Princess and half the kingdom, because a law is a law,
even if it happens to be a most incredible one.

They blew trumpets from the ramparts and the city towers, and they
announced, "The wedding will now take place." The Princess was not
especially happy about it, but she looked pretty and she wore her most
expensive clothes. The church was at its best by candle-light, late in
the evening. The ladies of the court sang in processions, and escorted
the bride. The lords sung, and accompanied the groom. From the way he
strutted and swaggered along, you'd think that nothing could ever bowl
him over.

Then the singing stopped. It was so still that you could have heard a
pin fall in the street. But it was not quiet for long. Crash! crash! the
great church doors flew open, and boom! boom! all the works of the clock
came marching down the church aisle and halted between the bride and the
groom.

Dead men cannot walk the earth. That's true, but a work of art does not
die. Its shape may be shattered, but the spirit of art cannot be broken.
The spirit of art jested, and that was no joke.

. To all appearances it stood there as if it were whole, and had never
been wrecked. The clock struck one hour right after another, from one to
twelve, and all the figures poured forth. First Moses came, shining as
if bright flames issued from his forehead. He cast the heavy stone
tablets of the law at the bridegroom's feet, and tied them to the
church floor. "I cannot lift them again," said Moses, "for you have
broken my arms. Stand where you are!"

Then came Adam and Eve, the three Wise Men of the East, and the four
Seasons. Each told him the disagreeable truth. "Shame on you!" But he
was not ashamed.

All the figures of all the hours marched out of the clock, and they grew
wondrous big. There was scarcely room for the living people. And at the
stroke of twelve out strode the watchman, with his cap and his
many-spiked morning star. There was a strange commotion. The watchman
went straight to the bridegroom, and smote him on the forehead with his
morning star.

"Lie where you are," said the watchman. "A blow for a blow. We have
taken out vengeance and the master's too, so now we will vanish."

And vanish they did, every cogwheel and figure. But the candles of the
church flared up like flowers of fire, and the gilded stars under the
roof cast down long clear shafts of light, and the organ sounded though
no man had touched it. The people all said that they had lived to see
the most incredible thing.

"Now," the Princess commanded, "summon the right man, the craftsman
who made the work of art. He shall be my husband and my lord."

He stood beside her in the church. All the people were in his train.
Everyone was happy for him, everyone blessed him, and there was no one
who was envious. And that was the most incredible thing.
