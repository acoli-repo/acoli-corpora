## The shepherdess and the sweep 

Have you ever seen an old wooden cupboard quite black with age, and
ornamented with carved foliage and curious figures? Well, just such a
cupboard stood in a parlor, and had been left to the family as a legacy
by the great-grandmother. It was covered from top to bottom with carved
roses and tulips; the most curious scrolls were drawn upon it, and out
of them peeped little stags' heads, with antlers. In the middle of the
cupboard door was the carved figure of a man most ridiculous to look at.
He grinned at you, for no one could call it laughing. He had goat's
legs, little horns on his head, and a long beard; the children in the
room always called him, "Major general-field-sergeant-commander
Billy-goat's-legs." It was certainly a very difficult name to
pronounce, and there are very few who ever receive such a title, but
then it seemed wonderful how he came to be carved at all; yet there he
was, always looking at the table under the looking-glass, where stood a
very pretty little shepherdess made of china. Her shoes were gilt, and
her dress had a red rose or an ornament. She wore a hat, and carried a
crook, that were both gilded, and looked very bright and pretty. Close
by her side stood a little chimney-sweep, as black as coal, and also
made of china. He was, however, quite as clean and neat as any other
china figure; he only represented a black chimney-sweep, and the china
workers might just as well have made him a prince, had they felt
inclined to do so.

He stood holding his ladder quite handily, and his face was as fair and
rosy as a girl's; indeed, that was rather a mistake, it should have had
some black marks on it. He and the shepherdess had been placed close
together, side by side; and, being so placed, they became engaged to
each other, for they were very well suited, being both made of the same
sort of china, and being equally fragile.

Close to them stood another figure, three times as large as they were,
and also made of china. He was an old Chinaman, who could nod his head,
and used to pretend that he was the grandfather of the shepherdess,
although he could not prove it. He however assumed authority over her,
and therefore when "Major-general-field-sergeant-commander
Billy-goat's-legs" asked for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he
nodded his head to show that he consented.

"You will have a husband," said the old Chinaman to her, "who I
really believe is made of mahogany. He will make you a lady of
Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs. He has the
whole cupboard full of silver plate, which he keeps locked up in secret
drawers."

"I won't go into the dark cupboard," said the little shepherdess. "I
have heard that he has eleven china wives there already."

"Then you shall be the twelfth," said the old Chinaman. "To-night as
soon as you hear a rattling in the old cupboard, you shall be married,
as true as I am a Chinaman;" and then he nodded his head and fell
asleep.

Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her sweetheart, the
china chimney-sweep.

"I must entreat you," said she, "to go out with me into the wide
world, for we cannot stay here."

"I will do whatever you wish," said the little chimney-sweep; "let us
go immediately: I think I shall be able to maintain you with my
profession."

"If we were but safely down from the table!" said she; "I shall not
be happy till we are really out in the world."

Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her little foot on
the carved edge and gilt-leaf ornaments of the table. He brought his
little ladder to help her, and so they contrived to reach the floor. But
when they looked at the old cupboard, they saw it was all in an uproar.
The carved stags pushed out their heads, raised their antlers, and
twisted their necks. The major-general sprung up in the air; and cried
out to the old Chinaman, "They are running away! they are running
away!"

The two were rather frightened at this, so they jumped into the drawer
of the window-seat.

Here were three or four packs of cards not quite complete, and a doll's
theatre, which had been built up very neatly. A comedy was being
performed in it, and all the queens of diamonds, clubs, and hearts, and
spades, sat in the first row fanning themselves with tulips, and behind
them stood all the knaves, showing that they had heads above and below
as playing cards generally have. The play was about two lovers, who were
not allowed to marry, and the shepherdess wept because it was so like
her own story.

"I cannot bear it," said she, "I must get out of the drawer;" but
when they reached the floor, and cast their eyes on the table, there was
the old Chinaman awake and shaking his whole body, till all at once down
he came on the floor, "plump."

"The old Chinaman is coming," cried the little shepherdess in a
fright, and down she fell on one knee.

"I have thought of something," said the chimney-sweep; "let us get
into the great pot-pourri jar which stands in the corner; there we can
lie on rose-leaves and lavender, and throw salt in his eyes if he comes
near us."

"No, that will never do," said she, "because I know that the Chinaman
and the pot-pourri jar were lovers once, and there always remains behind
a feeling of good-will between those who have been so intimate as that.
No, there is nothing left for us but to go out into the wide world."

"Have you really courage enough to go out into the wide world with
me?" said the chimney-sweep; "have you thought how large it is, and
that we can never come back here again?"

"Yes, I have," she replied.

When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he said, "My way is
through the stove and up the chimney. Have you courage to creep with me
through the fire-box, and the iron pipe? When we get to the chimney I
shall know how to manage very well. We shall soon climb too high for any
one to reach us, and we shall come through a hole in the top out into
the wide world."

So he led her to the door of the stove.

"It looks very dark," said she; still she went in with him through the
stove and through the pipe, where it was as dark as pitch.

"Now we are in the chimney," said he; "and look, there is a beautiful
star shining above it."

It was a real star shining down upon them as if it would show them the
way. So they clambered, and crept on, and a frightful steep place it
was; but the chimney-sweep helped her and supported her, till they got
higher and higher. He showed her the best places on which to set her
little china foot, so at last they reached the top of the chimney, and
sat themselves down, for they were very tired, as may be supposed.

The sky, with all its stars, was over their heads, and below were the
roofs of the town. They could see for a very long distance out into the
wide world, and the poor little shepherdess leaned her head on her
chimney-sweep's shoulder, and wept till she washed the gilt off her
sash; the world was so different to what she expected.

"This is too much," she said; "I cannot bear it, the world is too
large. Oh, I wish I were safe back on the table again, under the looking
glass; I shall never be happy till I am safe back again. Now I have
followed you out into the wide world, you will take me back, if you love
me."

Then the chimney-sweep tried to reason with her, and spoke of the old
Chinaman, and of the Major-general-field-sergeant-commander
Billy-goat's legs; but she sobbed so bitterly, and kissed her little
chimney-sweep till he was obliged to do all she asked, foolish as it
was.

And so, with a great deal of trouble, they climbed down the chimney, and
then crept through the pipe and stove, which were certainly not very
pleasant places. Then they stood in the dark fire-box, and listened
behind the door, to hear what was going on in the room. As it was all
quiet, they peeped out. Alas! there lay the old Chinaman on the floor;
he had fallen down from the table as he attempted to run after them, and
was broken into three pieces; his back had separated entirely, and his
head had rolled into a corner of the room. The major-general stood in
his old place, and appeared lost in thought.

"This is terrible," said the little shepherdess. "My poor old
grandfather is broken to pieces, and it is our fault. I shall never live
after this;" and she wrung her little hands.

"He can be riveted," said the chimney-sweep; "he can be riveted. Do
not be so hasty. If they cement his back, and put a good rivet in it, he
will be as good as new, and be able to say as many disagreeable things
to us as ever."

"Do you think so?" said she; and then they climbed up to the table,
and stood in their old places.

"As we have done no good," said the chimney-sweep, "we might as well
have remained here, instead of taking so much trouble."

"I wish grandfather was riveted," said the shepherdess. "Will it cost
much, I wonder?"

And she had her wish. The family had the Chinaman's back mended, and a
strong rivet put through his neck; he looked as good as new, but he
could no longer nod his head.

"You have become proud since your fall broke you to pieces," said
Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat's-legs. "You have no
reason to give yourself such airs. Am I to have her or not?"

The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked piteously at the old
Chinaman, for they were afraid he might nod; but he was not able:
besides, it was so tiresome to be always telling strangers he had a
rivet in the back of his neck. And so the little china people remained
together, and were glad of the grandfather's rivet, and continued to
love each other till they were broken to pieces.
