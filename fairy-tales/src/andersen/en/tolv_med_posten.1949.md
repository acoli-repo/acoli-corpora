## Twelve by the mail 

It was very frosty, starry clear weather, quiet and calm.

Bump! A pot was thrown against a door. Bang! Fireworks were shot off to
welcome the new year, for it was New Year's Eve; and now the clock
struck twelve!

Trateratra! There came the mail. The big mail coach stopped outside the
gate to the town. It carried twelve people and couldn't hold more, for
all the seats were taken.

"Hurrah! Hurrah!" rang out in the houses, where people were
celebrating New Year's Eve. They arose with full glasses and drank a
toast to the new year.

"Health and good wishes for the new year!" they said. "A pretty
little wife! Lots of money! An end to nonsense!"

Yes, these were their wishes for one another, and glasses were struck
together, while the mail coach stopped in front of the town gate with
the unknown guests, the twelve travelers.

What kind of people were they? They had passports and luggage with them;
yes, even presents for you and me and for all the people in the town.
Who were these strangers? What did they want, and what did they bring?

"Good morning!" they said to the sentry at the town gate.

"Good morning!" said he, as the clock had struck twelve. "Your name?
Your profession?" asked the sentry when the first of them stepped out
of the carriage.

"Look in the passport!" said the man. "I am myself!" And a
splendid-looking fellow he was, too, dressed in a bearskin and fur
boots. "I am the man on whom many people pin their hopes. Come to see
me tomorrow, and I'll give you a real new year! I throw dollars and
cents about, give presents, and, yes, I even give balls, thirty-one of
them; that's all the nights I have to spare. My ships are frozen tight,
but in my office it is warm. I am a merchant, and my name is January. I
have only bills!"

Then came the second. He was a comedian, a theatrical director, the
manager of masked balls, and all the amusements you could think of. His
luggage consisted of a great barrel.

"We'll beat the cat out of the barrel at carnival time!" he said.
"I'll amuse others, and myself, too, for I have the shortest time to
live of the whole family; I get to be only twenty-eight days old. Yes,
sometimes they throw in an extra day, but that doesn't make much
difference. Hurrah!"

"You must not shout so loud!" said the sentry.

"Yes, I may!" said the man. "I am Prince Carnival, and traveling
under the name of February!"

Now came the third. He looked very much like Fasting itself, but
strutted proudly, for he was related to the "Forty Knights," and was a
weather prophet. But that is hardly fattening employment, and for that
reason he approved of Fasting. He had a cluster of violets in his
buttonhole, but they were very small.

"March, March!" shouted the fourth, and pushed the third. "March,
March! Into the guardroom; there's punch there! I can smell it!"

But it wasn't true; he only wanted to make an April fool of him; thus
the fourth began his career in the town. He looked very jolly, did
little work, and had lots of holidays.

"Good humor one day and bad the next!" he said. "Rain and sunshine.
Moving out and moving in. I am also moving-day commissioner; I am an
undertaker. I can both laugh and cry. I have summer clothes in my trunk,
but it would be very foolish to use them now. Here I am! When I dress up
I wear silk stockings and carry a muff!"

Now a lady came out of the carriage. "Miss May," she called herself,
and wore summer clothes and overshoes. She had on a beech-tree-green
silk dress, and anemones in her hair, and she was so scented with wild
thyme that the sentry had to sneeze.

"God bless you!" she said, and that was her greeting.

She was beautiful. And she was a singer; not of the theater, but a
singer of the woodlands; not at county fairs; no, she roamed through the
fresh green forest and sang there for her own entertainment. In her
handbag she had a copy of Christian Winther's Woodcuts, which were like
the beech-tree forest itself, and also Little Poems by Richardt, which
were like the wild thyme.

"Now comes the mistress, the young mistress!" shouted those inside the
carriage.

And then out came the lady, young and delicate, proud and pretty. You
could easily see that she was born to be a lady of leisure. She gave a
great feast on the longest day of the year, so that her guests might
have time to eat the many dishes of food at her table. She could afford
to ride in a carriage of her own, but still she traveled in the mail
coach like the others, for she wanted to show she wasn't too proud. But
she didn't travel alone; with her was her elder brother, July.

' He was a well-fed fellow, in attire, and with a Panama hat. He had
but little baggage with him, because it was a nuisance in the heat. He
had brought only his bathing cap and swimming trunks; that isn't much.

Now came the mother, Madam August, a wholesale fruit dealer, proprietor
of many fish tanks, and landowner, wearing a great crinoline. She was
fat and hot, and took an active part in everything; she herself even
carried beer out to the workmen in the fields.

"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," she said. "That is
written in the Bible. Afterward we can have the picnics and dances in
the woods and the harvest festivals."

Such was the mother.

Now again came a man, a painter by profession, a master of colors, as
the forest soon learned. The leaves had to change their colors - but how
beautifully - whenever he wished it; soon the wood glowed with red,
yellow, and brown. The painter whistled like the black starling bird,
and was a brisk worker. He wound the brown-green hop plants around his
beer jug, which decorated it beautifully; indeed, he had an eye for
decorating. There he stood with his color pot, and that was all the
luggage he had.

Now followed a land proprietor, who was thinking of the grain month, of
the plowing and preparing of the land, and, yes, also a little of the
pleasures of field sports. He had his dog and his gun, and he had nuts
in his game bag. Crack, crack! He had an awful lot of baggage with him,
and even an English plow. And he talked about farming, but you couldn't
hear much of what he said, because of the coughing and gasping.

It was November coming. He had a cold, such a violent cold that he used
a bed sheet instead of a handkerchief; and yet he had to accompany the
servant girls and initiate them into their winter service, he said; but
his cold would go when he went out woodcutting, which he had to do,
because he was master sawyer for the firewood guild. His evenings he
spent cutting soles for skates, knowing that in a few weeks there would
be good use for these amusing shoes.

Now came the last passenger, a little old mother, with her firepot. She
was cold, but her eyes sparkled like two bright stars. She carried a
flowerpot with a little fir tree growing in it.

"I shall guard and nurse this tree, so that it may grow large by
Christmas Eve and reach from the ground right up to the ceiling, and be
covered with lighted candles, golden apples, and little cut-out paper
decorations. This fire-kettle warms like a Stove. I take the storybook
from my pocket and read aloud, so that all the children in the room
become quiet. But the dolls on the tree come to life, and the little wax
angel on top of the tree shakes its golden tinsel wings, flies down from
the green top, and kisses in the room, yes, the poor children, too, who
stand outside and sing the Christmas carol about the star of
Bethlehem."

"And now the coach can drive again," said the sentry. "We have the
twelve. Let another coach drive up!"

"First let the twelve come inside," said the Captain of the Guard, "
one at a time. I'll keep the passports. Each is good for a month; when
that has passed, I'll write a report of their behavior on each
passport. Be so good, Mr. January; please step inside."

And in he went.

When a year has passed, I shall be able to tell you what the twelve have
brought you, me, and all of us. I don't know it now, and they probably
don't know it themselves, for these are strange times we live in.
