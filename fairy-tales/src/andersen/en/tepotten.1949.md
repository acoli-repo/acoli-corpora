## The teapot 

There was a proud Teapot, proud of being made of porcelain, proud of its
long spout and its broad handle. It had something in front of it and
behind it; the spout was in front, and the handle behind, and that was
what it talked about. But it didn't mention its lid, for it was cracked
and it was riveted and full of defects, and we don't talk about our
defects - other people do that. The cups, the cream pitcher, the sugar
bowl - in fact, the whole tea service - thought much more about the
defects in the lid and talked more about it than about the sound handle
and the distinguished spout. The Teapot knew this.

"I know them," it told itself. "And I also know my imperfections, and
I realize that in that very knowledge is my humility and my modesty. We
all have many defects, but then we also have virtues. The cups have a
handle, the sugar bowl has a lid, but of course I have both, and one
thing more, one thing they can never have; I have a spout, and that
makes me the queen of the tea table. The sugar bowl and the cream
pitcher are permitted to be serving maids of delicacies, but I am the
one who gives forth, the adviser. I spread blessings abroad among
thirsty mankind. Inside of me the Chinese leaves give flavor to boiling,
tasteless water."

This was the way the Teapot talked in its fresh young life. It stood on
the table that was prepared for tea and it was lifted up by the most
delicate hand. But that most delicate hand was very awkward. The Teapot
was dropped; the spout broke off, and the handle broke off; the lid is
not worth talking about; enough has been said about that. The Teapot lay
in a faint on the floor, while the boiling water ran out of it. It was a
great shock it got, but the worst thing of all was that the others
laughed at it - and not at the awkward hand.

"I'll never be able to forget that!" said the Teapot, when later on
it talked to itself about its past life. "They called me an invalid,
and stood me in a corner, and the next day gave me to a woman who was
begging for food. I fell into poverty, and was speechless both outside
and inside, but as I stood there my better life began. One is one thing
and then becomes quite another. They put earth in me, and for a Teapot
that's the same as being buried, but in that earth they planted a
flower bulb. Who put it there and gave it to me, I don't know; but it
was planted there, a substitution for the Chinese leaves and the boiling
water, the broken handle and spout. And the bulb lay in the earth,
inside of me, and it became my heart, my living heart, a thing I never
had before. There was life in me; there were power and might; my pulse
beat. The bulb put out sprouts; thoughts and feeling sprang up and burst
forth into flower. I saw it, I bore it, and I forgot myself in its
beauty. It is a blessing to forget oneself in others!

"It didn't thank me, it didn't even think of me - everybody admired
it and praised it. It made me very happy; how much more happy it must
have made it!

"One day I heard them say it deserved a better pot. They broke me in
two - that really hurt - and the flower was put into a better pot; then
they threw me out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd. But I
have my memory; that I can never lose!"
