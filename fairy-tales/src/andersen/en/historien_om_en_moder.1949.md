## The story of a mother 

A mother sat by her little child; she was very sad, for she feared it
would die. It was quite pale, and its little eyes were closed, and
sometimes it drew a heavy deep breath, almost like a sigh; and then the
mother gazed more sadly than ever on the poor little creature.

Some one knocked at the door, and a poor old man walked in. He was
wrapped in something that looked like a great horse-cloth; and he
required it truly to keep him warm, for it was cold winter; the country
everywhere lay covered with snow and ice, and the wind blew so sharply
that it cut one's face.

The little child had dozed off to sleep for a moment, and the mother,
seeing that the old man shivered with the cold, rose and placed a small
mug of beer on the stove to warm for him. The old man sat and rocked the
cradle; and the mother seated herself on a chair near him, and looked at
her sick child who still breathed heavily, and took hold of its little
hand.

"You think I shall keep him, do you not?" she said. "Our all-merciful
God will surely not take him away from me."

The old man, who was indeed Death himself, nodded his head in a peculiar
manner, which might have signified either Yes, or No; and the mother
cast down her eyes, while the tears rolled down her cheeks. Then her
head became heavy, for she had not closed her eyes for three days and
nights, and she slept, but only for a moment. Shivering with cold, she
started up and looked round the room. The old man was gone, and her
child-- it was gone too!-- the old man had taken it with him. In the
corner of the room the old clock began to strike; "whirr" went the
chains, the heavy weight sank to the ground, and the clock stopped; and
the poor mother rushed out of the house calling for her child.

Out in the snow sat a woman in long black garments, and she said to the
mother, "Death has been with you in your room. I saw him hastening away
with your little child; he strides faster than the wind, and never
brings back what he has taken away."

"Only tell me which way he has gone," said the mother; "tell me the
way, I will find him."

"I know the way," said the woman in the black garments; "but before I
tell you, you must sing to me all the songs that you have sung to your
child; I love these songs, I have heard them before. I am Night, and I
saw your tears flow as you sang."

"I will sing them all to you," said the mother; "but do not detain me
now. I must overtake him, and find my child."

But Night sat silent and still. Then the mother wept and sang, and wrung
her hands. And there were many songs, and yet even more tears; till at
length Night said, "Go to the right, into the dark forest of fir-trees;
for I saw Death take that road with your little child."

Within the wood the mother came to cross roads, and she knew not which
to take. Just by stood a thorn-bush; it had neither leaf nor flower, for
it was the cold winter time, and icicles hung on the branches.

"Have you not seen Death go by, with my little child?" she asked.

"Yes," replied the thorn-bush; "but I will not tell you which way he
has taken until you have warmed me in your bosom. I am freezing to death
here, and turning to ice."

Then she pressed the bramble to her bosom quite close, so that it might
be thawed, and the thorns pierced her flesh, and great drops of blood
flowed; but the bramble shot forth fresh green leaves, and they became
flowers on the cold winter's night, so warm is the heart of a sorrowing
mother. Then the bramble-bush told her the path she must take.

She came at length to a great lake, on which there was neither ship nor
boat to be seen. The lake was not frozen sufficiently for her to pass
over on the ice, nor was it open enough for her to wade through; and yet
she must cross it, if she wished to find her child. Then she laid
herself down to drink up the water of the lake, which was of course
impossible for any human being to do; but the bereaved mother thought
that perhaps a miracle might take place to help her.

"You will never succeed in this," said the lake; "let us make an
agreement together which will be better. I love to collect pearls, and
your eyes are the purest I have ever seen. If you will weep those eyes
away in tears into my waters, then I will take you to the large hothouse
where Death dwells and rears flowers and trees, every one of which is a
human life."

"Oh, what would I not give to reach my child!" said the weeping
mother; and as she still continued to weep, her eyes fell into the
depths of the lake, and became two costly pearls. Then the lake lifted
her up, and wafted her across to the opposite shore as if she were on a
swing, where stood a wonderful building many miles in length. No one
could tell whether it was a mountain covered with forests and full of
caves, or whether it had been built. But the poor mother could not see,
for she had wept her eyes into the lake.

"Where shall I find Death, who went away with my little child?" she
asked.

"He has not arrived here yet," said an old gray-haired woman, who was
walking about, and watering Death's hothouse. "How have you found your
way here? and who helped you?"

"God has helped me," she replied. "He is merciful; will you not be
merciful too? Where shall I find my little child?"

"I did not know the child," said the old woman; "and you are blind.
Many flowers and trees have faded to-night, and Death will soon come to
transplant them. You know already that every human being has a life-tree
or a life-flower, just as may be ordained for him. They look like other
plants; but they have hearts that beat. Children's hearts also beat:
from that you may perhaps be able to recognize your child. But what will
you give me, if I tell you what more you will have to do?"

"I have nothing to give," said the afflicted mother; "but I would go
to the ends of the earth for you."

"I can give you nothing to do for me there," said the old woman; "but
you can give me your long black hair. You know yourself that it is
beautiful, and it pleases me. You can take my white hair in exchange,
which will be something in return."

"Do you ask nothing more than that?" said she. "I will give it to you
with pleasure."

And she gave up her beautiful hair, and received in return the white
locks of the old woman. Then they went into Death's vast hothouse,
where flowers and trees grew together in wonderful profusion. Blooming
hyacinths, under glass bells, and peonies, like strong trees. There grew
water-plants, some quite fresh, and others looking sickly, which had
water-snakes twining round them, and black crabs clinging to their
stems. There stood noble palm-trees, oaks, and plantains, and beneath
them bloomed thyme and parsley. Each tree and flower had a name; each
represented a human life, and belonged to men still living, some in
China, others in Greenland, and in all parts of the world. Some large
trees had been planted in little pots, so that they were cramped for
room, and seemed about to burst the pot to pieces; while many weak
little flowers were growing in rich soil, with moss all around them,
carefully tended and cared for. The sorrowing mother bent over the
little plants, and heard the human heart beating in each, and recognized
the beatings of her child's heart among millions of others.

"That is it," she cried, stretching out her hand towards a little
crocus-flower which hung down its sickly head.

"Do not touch the flower," exclaimed the old woman; "but place
yourself here; and when Death comes-- I expect him every minute-- do not
let him pull up that plant, but threaten him that if he does you will
serve the other flowers in the same manner. This will make him afraid;
for he must account to God for each of them. None can be uprooted,
unless he receives permission to do so."

There rushed through the hothouse a chill of icy coldness, and the blind
mother felt that Death had arrived.

"How did you find your way hither?" asked he; "how could you come
here faster than I have?"

"I am a mother," she answered.

And Death stretched out his hand towards the delicate little flower; but
she held her hands tightly round it, and held it fast at same time, with
the most anxious care, lest she should touch one of the leaves. Then
Death breathed upon her hands, and she felt his breath colder than the
icy wind, and her hands sank down powerless.

"You cannot prevail against me," said Death.

"But a God of mercy can," said she.

"I only do His will," replied Death. "I am his gardener. I take all
His flowers and trees, and transplant them into the gardens of Paradise
in an unknown land. How they flourish there, and what that garden
resembles, I may not tell you."

"Give me back my child," said the mother, weeping and imploring; and
she seized two beautiful flowers in her hands, and cried to Death, "I
will tear up all your flowers, for I am in despair."

"Do not touch them," said Death. "You say you are unhappy; and would
you make another mother as unhappy as yourself?"

"Another mother!" cried the poor woman, setting the flowers free from
her hands.

"There are your eyes," said Death. "I fished them up out of the lake
for you. They were shining brightly; but I knew not they were yours.
Take them back-- they are clearer now than before-- and then look into
the deep well which is close by here. I will tell you the names of the
two flowers which you wished to pull up; and you will see the whole
future of the human beings they represent, and what you were about to
frustrate and destroy."

Then she looked into the well; and it was a glorious sight to behold how
one of them became a blessing to the world, and how much happiness and
joy it spread around. But she saw that the life of the other was full of
care and poverty, misery and woe.

"Both are the will of God," said Death.

"Which is the unhappy flower, and which is the blessed one?" she said.

"That I may not tell you," said Death; "but thus far you may learn,
that one of the two flowers represents your own child. It was the fate
of your child that you saw,-- the future of your own child."

Then the mother screamed aloud with terror, "Which of them belongs to
my child? Tell me that. Deliver the unhappy child. Release it from so
much misery. Rather take it away. Take it to the kingdom of God. Forget
my tears and my entreaties; forget all that I have said or done."

"I do not understand you," said Death. "Will you have your child
back? or shall I carry him away to a place that you do not know?"

Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to God,
"Grant not my prayers, when they are contrary to Thy will, which at all
times must be the best. Oh, hear them not;" and her head sank on her
bosom.

Then Death carried away her child to the unknown land.
