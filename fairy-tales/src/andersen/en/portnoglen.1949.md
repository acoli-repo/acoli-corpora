## The gate key 

Every key has a history, and there are many kinds of keys - a
chamberlain's key, a watch key, Saint Peter's key. We could tell you
about all the keys; but now we will only tell about the councilor's
gate key.

It had come into being at a locksmith's, but it might well have
believed it had been made by a blacksmith, the way the man had worked on
it with hammer and file. It was too large for one's trouser pocket, so
it had to be put into the overcoat pocket. There it often lay in utter
darkness; yet it had its own special hanging place on the wall, beside a
childhood silhouette of the Councilor, in which he looked like a
dumpling dressed in a frilled shirt.

It is said that every human being acquires in his character and conduct
something from the astrological sign under which he has been born, such
as the Bull, the Virgin, or Scorpion, as they are called in the
almanacs. The Councilor's wife never mentioned the names of any of
these; she said that her husband was born under the sign of the
"Wheelbarrow," for he always had to be pushed on. His father had
pushed him into an office; his mother had pushed him into matrimony; and
his wife had pushed him on to become a councilor; the latter fact,
however, she did not mention, being a good, sensible sort of woman who
kept quiet in the right place and spoke and pushed in the right place.

He was now along in years - "well proportioned," as he said himself -
a well-read man, good-natured, and "key wise" as well, which is
something we shall better understand later. He was always in a good
humor, loved all mankind, and liked to talk to everybody. If he went
into the city, it was difficult to get him home again when his wife was
not with him to push him along. He simply had to talk to every
acquaintance he met; he had a lot of acquaintances, and this often made
him late for dinner. Mrs. Councilor would sit at the window and watch
for him. "Here he comes," she would say to the maid; "put the pot on
the fire. Now he has stopped to speak to somebody, so take the pot off,
or the food will be cooked too much. Now he is finally coming, so put
the pot on again!"

But then he wouldn't come, after all. He would stand right under the
windows of the house and nod up to her, and if an acquaintance happened
to come by then, he could not keep from saying a few words to him; if
while he was talking to this one, another one came by, he would take
hold of the first by the buttonhole, clasp the other's hand, and shout
to a third who wanted to pass by.

This was a heavy trial for the patience of the Councilor's wife.
"Councilor! Councilor!" she would shout. "Yes, indeed, that man was
born under the sign of the 'Wheelbarrow'; he won't move unless he is
being pushed."

He was very fond of visiting bookshops and looking at books and
periodicals. He would give his bookseller a small amount of money for
the privilege of reading the new books at home, which meant he had
permission to cut the leaves of the books along the side but not across
the top, for then they could not be sold as new. He was a living
newspaper, but a harmless one, and knew everything about engagements,
weddings, and funerals, book talk and town talk. Yes, and he even gave
out mysterious hints regarding matters no one else knew anything about.
This mysterious information came from the gate key.

The Councilor and his wife had lived in their own house since young and
newly married, and they'd had that very same gate key since then; but
in those days they hadn't yet come to know of its unusual powers, and
not until much later had they learned of these.

It was at the time of King Frederick VI. Copenhagen had no gas then; it
had only train-oil lamps; it had no Tivoli Gardens, no Casino Theater,
no streetcars, and no railways. It had very few public amusements,
compared with what it now has. On Sundays one would go for a walk, out
beyond the city gates, to the Assistants' Churchyard, read the
inscriptions on the graves, sit down in the grass, eat from one's food
basket, and drink a glass of schnapps; or one would go to Frederiksberg,
where in front of the palace military music was played; and many people
would go to see the royal family rowing about in the small, narrow
canals of the park, with old King himself steering the boat, and he and
the Queen greeting everyone, without distinction of rank. Well-to-do
families from the city would come to this place and drink their
afternoon tea. They could get hot water at a small farmhouse in the
field outside the park, but they had to bring their own tea service
along.

One sunny Sunday afternoon the Councilor and his wife went out to the
park, the servant girl walking in front with the tea service, a basket
of food, and a "sip of Spendrup's Liqueur."

"Bring the gate key," Mrs. Councilor had said, "so we can get in by
ourselves when we return; you know, they lock the gate here at
nightfall, and the bell cord was broken this morning! It will be late
before we get home! After we've been in Frederiksberg Park, we are
going to the Casorti's theater at Vesterbro to see the pantomime,
Harlequin, Chief of the Thrashers. You see them come down in a cloud; it
costs two kroner a person."

And so they went to Frederiksberg, heard the music, saw the royal barges
with their waving banners, saw the old King and the white swans. After
drinking some very good tea, they hurried away; yet they did not arrive
at the theater on time.

The rope-dance act was finished, the dance on stilts was finished, and
the pantomime had started; as always, they were too late, and that was
the Councilor's fault; every moment on the road, he had stopped to
speak to an acquaintance. Within the theater he also found several good
friends, and when the performance was over, he and his wife were obliged
to accompany a family home at Vesterbro, to enjoy a glass of punch; they
would stop for only ten minutes. But this was extended to a whole hour.
They talked and talked. Especially entertaining was a Swedish baron, or,
perhaps, he was German, for the Councilor hadn't quite caught which -
but, on the other hand, the trick with the key that the baron taught him
he caught and always remembered. This trick was extraordinarily
interesting! He could get the key to answer everything that one asked
it, even questions pertaining to the most secret matters. The
Councilor's gate key was particularly suitable for performing this
trick; its bit was heavy, and this part had to hang downward. The baron
let the handle of the key rest on the forefinger of his right hand.
There it hung loosely and lightly, and every pulsebeat in his finger
could put it into motion and make it swing; and if this failed to
happen, the baron understood how unnoticeably to make it turn as he
wished. Every turn denoted a letter of the alphabet, and as many letters
as desired, from A on through the alphabet, could be indicated by the
key. When the first letter of a word was revealed, the key would turn to
the opposite side; then the next letter would be sought, and in that
manner one got whole words, sentences, and answers to questions. It was
all a fake, but at any rate provided amusement; this was the
Councilor's first thought, but he did not retain it; he became very
engrossed in the key.

"Husband! Husband!" cried Mrs. Councilor. "The Westgate closes at
twelve o'clock! We won't get through; we have only a quarter of an
hour in which to hurry there."

They had to hurry indeed; several persons who were going into the city
soon got ahead of them. They finally approached the outside guardhouse
as the clock was striking twelve and the gates were being slammed shut.
A number of people were locked out, and among these were the Councilor
and his wife, with their servant girl, tea service, and empty food
basket. Some stood there greatly frightened, while others were very
annoyed, each reacting in his own manner. What could be done?
Fortunately, an ordinance had been passed of late that one of the city
gates, the Northgate, should not be locked at night, and there
pedestrians were allowed to slip through the guardhouse into the city.

The road to the Northgate was by no means short, but the weather was
fine, the sky bright with starlight and shooting stars; the frogs were
croaking in the ditches and ponds. The party began singing and sang one
song after another, but the Councilor did not sing; nor did he look up
at the stars or even look at his own feet. He then fell down at the edge
of the ditch, the full length of his body alongside it. One might have
thought that he had had too much to drink; but it was not the punch, it
was the key, that had gone to his head, and kept on turning there. They
finally reached the Northgate guardhouse, slipped across the bridge and
into the city.

"Now I am happy again, " said the Councilor's wife. "Here's our
gate."

"But where is the gate key," said the Councilor. It was neither in the
back pocket nor in the side pocket.

"Good gracious!" cried the Councilor's wife. "Haven't you got the
key? You must have lost it after letting the Baron use it for the key
trick. How will we get in now? You know the bell cord was broken this
morning, and the watchman doesn't have a key to our home. We are in a
hopeless situation!"

The servant girl began to cry. The Councilor was the only one who showed
presence of mind.

"We must break in a windowpane at the grocer's downstairs!" he said,
"get him up, and then we can get into the building."

He broke one pane; he broke two. "Petersen!" he shouted, as the put
the handle of his umbrella in through the windowpanes. Whereupon the
grocer's daughter began to scream loudly. The grocer threw open the
door of his shop and shouted, "Watchman!" And before he had a chance
to see and recognize the Councilor's family and let them in, the
watchman blew his whistle, and in the next street another watchman
answered and whistled. People appeared in the windows. "Where is the
fire? Where is the cause of all the excitement?" they asked, and were
still asking such questions even after the Councilor was in his room.
There he removed his overcoat - and in it lay the gate key, not in the
pocket, but inside the lining; it had slipped through a hole that should
not have been in the pocket.

From that night on, the gate key held a unique and great importance, not
only when it was taken out in the evening, but also when remaining at
home, for in either case the Councilor would show how clever he was by
making the key answer questions. He would think of the most likely
answer and then pretend to let the key give it. Finally, he himself came
to believe in the power of the key.

That was not so of the Pharmacist, however, a young man closely related
to the Councilor's wife. The Pharmacist had a good head, a critical
mind; he had, as mere schoolboy, sent in critical articles on books and
the theater, but without his signature, which is always important. He
was what one calls a bel esprit, but he by no means believed in spirits,
and, least of all, key spirits.

"Yes, I believe, I believe," he said, "blessed Mr. Councilor, I
believe in gate keys and all key spirits as firmly as I believe in that
new science which is beginning to become known the table dance and the
spirits in old and new furniture. Have you heard about that? I have! I
have doubted - you know I am a skeptic - but I have been converted by
reading, in a quite reliable foreign paper, a dreadful story. Councilor,
can you imagine! I will give you the story as I read it. Two clever
children had seen their parents raise the spirits in a large dining-room
table. The little ones were alone, and decided they would try, in the
same manner, to rub life into an old chest of drawers. Life came, for a
spirit was awakened; but it did not tolerate the commands of mere
children; it arose, and the chest of drawers creaked; it then shot out
the drawers, and with its wooden legs put each of the children in a
separate drawer. The chest of drawers then ran off with them, out the
open door, down the stairs, into the street, and over to the canal,
where it jumped out into the water and drowned both the children. Their
little bodies were given Christian burial, but the chest of drawers was
taken to the town hall, tried for murder, and burned alive in the market
place! I have read this," said the Pharmacist, "in a foreign paper; it
is not something I have invented myself. This is the truth, and may the
key take me if it isn't! I swear to it - on my oath!"

The Councilor found that such talk was all too much like a coarse joke.
The two could never speak agreeably about the key. The Pharmacist was
key ignorant.

The Councilor made progress in his key knowledge; the key was his
diversion and channel of wisdom.

One evening, as the Councilor was getting ready to go to bed, and was
half undressed, there was a knock on the front door. It was the
shopkeeper from downstairs who was calling at this late hour; he, too,
was half undressed, but he had suddenly had a thought, he said, which he
was afraid he would not be able to retain through the night.

"It is my daughter Lotte-Lene I must talk about. She is a beautiful
girl, and has been confirmed, and now I would like to see her well
provided for."

"But I am not as yet a widower!" said the Councilor, and chuckled,
"and I have no son to offer her."

"You must understand me, Councilor," said the man from downstairs.
"She can play the piano, and she can sing; you must be able to hear her
upstairs. You have no idea of all the things that little girl is able to
do; she can talk and entertain people. She is made for the stage, and
that is a good course for pretty girls of good families to take; they
may even have an opportunity to marry a count, though neither I nor
Lotte-Lene are thinking of that. She can indeed sing and play the piano,
so the other day I took her up to the singing school. She sang; but she
doesn't have a beer bass, as I call it in women, nor does she shriek
those very high canary-bird notes which they now demand in singers, and
so they advised her strongly against pursuing that career. Well, I
thought, if she can't become a singer, she can always become an
actress; that only requires the ability to speak. Today I talked about
it to the Instructor as they call him. 'Is she well read?' he asked.
'No, ' I said, 'not at all.' 'But it is necessary for an actress to
be well read!' said he. She still has time for that, was my opinion;
and then I went home. She can go to a rental library and read what is to
be had there, I thought.

"But then tonight, while I was undressing, it occurred to me - why rent
books when one can borrow them? The Councilor has plenty of books; let
her read them; there is enough reading here for her, and it could be
hers gratis!"

"Lotte-Lene is a nice girl," said the Councilor, "a beautiful girl!
She shall have books to read. But has she what one calls grit and
spirit - aptitude - genius? And, what is equally important, has she luck
with her?"

"She has twice won in the lottery," said the grocer from downstairs.
"Once she won a clothes cabinet, and another time six pairs of bed
sheets; that I call luck, and that she has!"

"I shall ask the key," said the Councilor. And he placed the key on
his right forefinger, and on the grocer's right forefinger as well, and
then the key swung and gave out letter after letter.

The key said, "Victory and luck!" And so Lotte-Lene's future was
decided.

The Councilor at once gave her two books to read, Dyveke and Knigge's
Social Intercourse.

That night marked the beginning of a closer acquaintance between
Lotte-Lene and the Councilor and his wife. She would come upstairs to
the couple, and the Councilor found her to be a sensible girl; she
believed in him and the key. The Councilor's wife saw something
childish and innocent in the frankness with which she would at every
moment show her great ignorance. The couple was fond of her, he in his
way and she in hers, and Lotte-Lene was fond of them.

"It smells so lovely upstairs," Lotte-Lene would say. There was an
odor, a fragrance, an apple fragrance, in the hallway, where the
Councilor's wife had put away a whole barrel of graystone apples. There
was also an incense odor of roses and lavender throughout all the rooms.
"There is something refined in that!" Lotte-Lene would say.

Then, too, her eyes were pleased by the many pretty flowers the
Councilor's wife always had. Even in the middle of winter, lilacs and
cherry-tree slips bloomed here. The leafless twigs were cut off and put
into water and in the warm room soon bore leaves and flowers.

"One would have thought that all life was gone from these naked
branches, but see how they rise from the dead. It has never occurred to
me before," said Lotte-Lene, "how wonderful nature is!"

And the Councilor let her look at his "key book, " in which were
written strange things the key had said - even about the half of an
apple cake that had disappeared from the cupboard on the very evening
that the servant girl had had her sweetheart there for a visit. The
Councilor had asked his key. "Who has eaten the apple cake, the cat or
the sweetheart?" and the key had replied, "The sweetheart." The
Councilor had already thought so before asking the key; and the servant
girl had confessed, "That cursed key knows everything!"

"Yes, isn't it strange!" said the Councilor. "That key, that key!
And about Lotte-Lene it has said, 'Victory and luck.' That we shall
see! I swear to it."

"That's wonderful" said Lotte-Lene.

The Councilor's wife was not so confident, but she did not express her
doubts when her husband was within hearing distance. She later told
Lotte-Lene in confidence that the Councilor, when a young man, had been
quite taken with the theater. Had someone pushed him a little in that
direction, he surely would have become an actor; his family, however,
had pushed him in the opposite direction. But, he had still aspired to
the stage, and to further that ambition he had written a play.

"This is a great secret that I am entrusting you with, little
Lotte-Lene. The play was not bad; it was accepted at the Royal Theater,
and then hissed out, and no one has since heard of it, for which I am
glad. I am his wife and know him. Now you want such a career, too. I
wish you all that is good, but I don't think that things will work out
as predicted; I don't believe in the gate key."

Lotte-Lene believed in it, and in that belief she was united with the
Councilor. Within their hearts they had a mutual understanding, in all
honor and chastity.

The girl had many qualifications that the Councilor's wife valued.
Lotte-Lene knew how to make starch from potatoes, make silk gloves from
old silk stockings, and recover her silk dancing shoes, although she
could afford to buy all her clothes new. She had, as the grocer said,
pennies in the table drawer and credit notes in her money safe. She
would make just the wife for the Pharmacist, thought the Councilor's
wife, but she did not say so, and of course didn't permit the key to
say anything about it. The Pharmacist was going to settle down soon and
have his own pharmacy in one of the nearest and largest provincial
towns.

Lotte-Lene was continually reading Dyveke and Knigge's Social
Intercourse. She kept the two books for two years, and by the end of
that time she had learned one, Dyveke, by heart - all the parts,
although she wished to play only one, that of Dyveke; she did not,
however, want to appear at first in the capital, where there is so much
envy, and where they would not have her, anyway. She wanted to start her
artistic career, as the Councilor called it, in one of the country's
large provincial towns. Now that, strangely enough, turned out to be the
same place where the youthful Pharmacist had settled down as the
youngest of the town's pharmacists.

The great, long-awaited night came on which Lotte-Lene was to make her
debut and have "victory and luck," as the key had said. The Councilor
was not there, for he lay in his bed, and his wife was nursing him; he
had to have warm napkins and camomile tea; the napkins about his body
and the tea in his body.

While the couple was absent from the Dyveke performance, the Pharmacist
was there, and wrote a letter about it to his relative, the Councilor's
wife.

"Dyveke's ruff was the best thing about it," he wrote. "If I had had
the Councilor's gate key in my pocket, I would have pulled it out and
used it as a whistle; she deserved it, and the key deserved it, because
of its nasty lie about her 'victory and luck.'"

The Councilor read the letter. It was all spitefulness, he said, key
hatred, aimed at that innocent girl. And as soon as he was out of bed
and was himself again, he sent a short but poisonous note to the
Pharmacist, who in turn replied as if he had seen only jest and good
humor in the whole epistle. He thanked him for this and for any future
contribution to the revelation of the incomparable worth and
significance of keys; next he confided to the Councilor that, apart from
his activities as an apothecary, he was writing a great key novel in
which all the characters were keys and keys alone. A gate key naturally
was the central character and - patterned after the Councilor's gate
key - was gifted with prophetic vision and second sight; around this all
the other keys had to revolve - the old chamberlain's key, experienced
in the splendor and festivity of the court; the watch key, small,
refined, and distinguished, but worth only a few pennies at the
ironmonger's; the key to the church pew, which counted itself among the
clergy, and which, from remaining one night in its keyhole in the
church, could see ghosts; the larder key, the wine-cellar key, and the
coal-cellar key all appeared, and bowed before, and turned around, the
gate key. The sunbeams brightened it into silver, and the wind, that
spirit of the earth, entered its body and made it whistle!

It was the key of all keys; it was the Councilor's gate key. It was now
the key of the heavenly gate itself; it was the papal key; it was
infallible!

"Wickedness!" said the Councilor. "Great wickedness!"

He and the Pharmacist never saw each other again - except once, and that
was at the funeral of the Councilor's wife.

She was the first to die. There were sorrow an emptiness in the house.
Even the slips of cherry which had thrown out fresh roots and flowers
seemed to mourn and fade away; they stood forgotten, for she was not
there to tend them.

The Councilor and the Pharmacist walked behind her coffin, side by side,
as the two nearest relations of the departed. This was not the time, nor
were they in the mood, for quarreling. Lotte-Lene tied the mourning
crape around the Councilor's hat. She was living in the house again,
having long since returned without victory and luck in her career. Yet
that still might come; Lotte-Lene had a future before her; the key had
said so, and the Councilor had said so.

She went up to him. They talked about the departed and they wept, for
Lotte-Lene was tenderhearted; but when they talked about the art,
Lotte-Lene felt strong. "Life in the theater is charming," she said,
"but there is so much nonsense and envy! I would rather go my own way.
Myself first, then art!"

Knigge had told the truth in his chapter about actors; that she was
aware of; the key had not told the truth, but she never spoke of this to
the Councilor; she was fond of him. Besides, the gate key was his
comfort and relief during the whole year of mourning. He gave it
questions, and it gave him answers.

And when the year had passed, and he and Lotte-Lene were sitting
together one inspiring evening; he asked the key, "Will I marry, and
whom will I marry?" No one pushed him, but he pushed the key, and it
answered, "Lotte-Lene!"

So it was said, and Lotte-Lene became Mrs. Councilor.

"Victory and luck!"

And these words had been said before -by the gate key.
