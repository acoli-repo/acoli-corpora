## Clumsy Hans 

Out in the country there was an old mansion where an old squire lived
with his two sons, who were so witty that they thought themselves too
clever for words. They decided to go out and propose to the King's
daughter, which they were at liberty to do, for she had announced
publicly that she would take for a husband the man who had the most to
say for himself.

The two brothers made their preparations for eight days beforehand. That
was all the time they had, but it was enough, for they had many
accomplishments, and everyone knows how useful they can be. One of them
knew the whole Latin dictionary by heart and the town's newspaper for
three years - so well that he could repeat it backward or forward. The
other had learned all the articles of law and knew what every alderman
must know; consequently, he was sure he could talk of governmental
affairs, and besides this he could embroider suspenders, for he was very
gentle and also clever with his fingers.

"I shall win the Princess!" they both said, as their father gave each
one of them a beautiful horse. The one who had memorized the dictionary
and the newspapers had a coal-black horse, while the one who knew all
about governmental affairs and could embroider had a milk-white one.
Then they smeared the corners of their mouths with cod-liver oil, to
make them more glib.

All the servants assembled in the courtyard to watch them mount their
horses, but just then the third brother came up; for there were really
three, although nobody paid much attention to the third, because he was
not so learned as the other two. In fact, everybody called him "Clumsy
Hans."

"Where are you going in all your Sunday clothes?" he asked.

"To the King's court, to woo the Princess. Haven't you heard what the
King's drummer is proclaiming all over the country?" Then they told
him about it.

"Gracious," said Clumsy Hans, "I guess I'll go, too!" But his
brothers only burst out laughing at him as they rode away.

"Father," shouted Clumsy Hans, "Let me have a horse. I feel like
getting married, too. If she takes me, she takes me; and if she doesn't
take me, I'll take her, anyway."

"That's a lot of nonsense!" replied his father. "You'll get no
horse from me. Why, you don't know how to talk properly. Now, your
brothers are intelligent men."

"If I can't have a horse I'll take the billy goat," said Clumsy
Hans. "He belongs to me, and he can carry me very well." So he mounted
the billy goat, dug his heels into its sides, and galloped off down the
highway.

"Alley-oop! What a ride! Here I come!" shouted Clumsy Hans, singing so
loud that his voice was heard far away.

But his two brothers rode quietly on ahead of him. They were not
speaking a word to each other, for they were thinking about all the
clever speeches they would have to make, and of course these had to be
carefully prepared and memorized beforehand.

"Halloo!" cried Clumsy Hans. "Here I come! Look what I found on the
road!" Then he showed them a dead crow he had picked up.

"Clumsy!" said the brothers. "What are you going to do with that?"

"Why, I am going to give it to the Princess!"

"Yes, you do that," they said as they rode on laughing.

"Halloo, here I come again! Just look what I've found this time! You
don't find things like this in the road every day!" So the brothers
turned around to see what it was this time.

"Clumsy!" they said. "That's just an old wooden shoe, and the upper
part's broken off, anyway. Is the Princess going to have that, too?"

"She certainly is," replied Hans, and the brothers again laughed and
rode on far in advance of him.

"Halloo! Here I am again," shouted Clumsy Hans. "Now this is getting
better and better! This is really something!"

"Well, what have you found this time?" asked the brothers.

"Oh, I can't really tell you," Clumsy Hans said. "How pleased the
Princess will be!"

"Uh!" said the brothers. "Why, it's nothing but mud out of the
ditch!"

"Yes, of course," said Clumsy Hans, "but the very finest sort of mud.
Look, it runs right through your fingers." Then he filled his pockets
with it.

But his brothers galloped on ahead as fast as they could, and so they
arrived at the town gate a full hour ahead of Hans. At the gate each
suitor was given a numbered ticket, and as fast as they arrived they
were arranged in rows, six to a row, packed together so tightly that
they could not even move their arms. That was a wise plan, for otherwise
they could have cut each other's backs to pieces, just because one
stood in front of another. All the inhabitants of the town stood around
the castle, peering in through the windows to watch the Princess receive
her suitors; but as each young man came into the room, he became
tongue-tied.

"No good!" said the Princess. "Take him away!"

Now came the brother who had memorized the dictionary, but he had
completely forgotten it while standing in line. The floor creaked under
his footsteps, and the ceiling was made of mirrors so that he could see
himself standing on his head; and at each window stood three clerks and
an alderman, writing down every word that was spoken, so that it
immediately could be printed in the newspapers and sold for two pennies
on the street corners.

It was a terrible ordeal, and besides there were such fires in the
stoves that the pipe was red-hot.

"It's terribly hot in here," said the suitor.

"That's because my father is roasting chickens today," said the
Princess.

"Baa!" There he stood. He was not ready for a speech of this kind and
hadn't a word to say, just when he wanted to say something extremely
witty. "Baa!"

"No good!" said the Princess. "Take him away!" And consequently he
had to leave.

Now the second brother approached.

"It's dreadfully warm here," he said.

"Yes, we're roasting chickens today," replied the Princess.

"What-what did you-uh-what?" he stammered, and all the clerks
carefully wrote down, "What-what did you-uh-what?"

"No good," said the Princess again. "Out with him!"

Now it was Clumsy Hans's turn, and he rode his billy goat right into
the hall.

"Terribly hot in here," he said.

"I'm roasting young chickens," replied the Princess.

"Why, that's fine!" said Clumsy Hans. "Then I suppose I can get my
crow roasted?"

"That you can," said the Princess. "But have you anything to roast it
in? I haven't any pots or pans."

"But I have," replied Clumsy Hans. "Here's a cooking pot with a tin
handle!" Then he pulled out the old wooden shoe and put the crow right
into it.

"Why, that's enough for a whole meal!" said the Princess. "But where
do we get the sauce from?"

"I have that in my pocket," replied Clumsy Hans. "In fact, I have so
much I can afford to spill some of it." Then he poured a little of the
mud from his pocket.

"I like that!" said the Princess. "You have an answer for everything,
and you know how to speak. I'll take you for my husband. But do you
know that everything we've said and are saying is written down and will
be published in the paper tomorrow? Look over there, and you'll see in
each window three clerks and an old alderman, and that alderman is the
worst of all; he doesn't understand anything!"

She said this only to frighten him, but all the clerks chuckled with
delight and spurted blots of ink on the floor.

"Oh, so these are the gentlemen!" said Clumsy Hans. "Then I must give
the alderman the best thing I have." Then he turned out his pockets and
threw the wet mud in the face of the alderman.

"Cleverly done!" said the Princess. "I could never have done that,
but I'll learn in time!"

So Clumsy Hans was made a king, with a wife and a crown, and sat on a
throne. And we had this story straight from the alderman's
newspaper-but that is one you can't always depend upon.
