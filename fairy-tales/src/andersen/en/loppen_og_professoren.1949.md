## The flea and the professor 

There was an aëronaut, and things went badly with him. His balloon
burst, hurled him out, and went all to pieces. Just two minutes before,
the aëronaut had sent his boy down by parachute - wasn't the boy lucky!
He wasn't hurt, and he knew enough to be an aëronaut himself, but he
had no balloon and no means of getting one.

Live he must, so he took to sleight-of-hand tricks, and to throwing his
voice, which is called ventriloquism. He was young and good-looking.
When he grew a mustache and wore his best clothes, he might well have
been mistaken for the son of a nobleman. Ladies found him handsome and
one young lady was so taken by his charm and dexterity that she eloped
with him to foreign lands. There he called himself "The Professor" -
he could scarcely do less.

He continually thought about how to get himself a balloon and sail
through the air with his little wife. But they still lacked the means to
do so.

"That will come yet," he said.

"Oh, if only it would," said she.

"We are still young people," he said, "and I'm a Professor."

"Crumbs are also bread!"

She helped him all she could, and sat at the door to sell tickets for
his entertainments. In the wintertime this was a chilly sort of
pleasure. She also helped him with one of his acts. He would put her
into a table drawer - a large table drawer - and she would creep into
the back drawer. From in front she was not to be seen, and as far as the
audience was concerned she was invisible. But one evening, when he
pulled out the drawer she was invisible to him too. She was not in the
front drawer, not in the back one, and not in the whole house. She was
nowhere to be seen or heard, and that was her contribution to the
entertainment.

She never came back. She was tired of it all, and he became tired of it
too. He lost his good humor and could not laugh or make jokes, so people
stopped coming to see him. His earnings fell off and his clothes wore
out, until at last all that he had was a large flea, an heirloom from
his wife; that's why he liked it so well. He trained the flea and
taught it to perform - to present arms, and to fire off a cannon. Of
course it was a very small cannon.

The Professor was proud of the flea, and the flea was proud of himself.
He had learned a thing or two, and had human blood in him. He had been
to the largest cities. Princes and Princesses had seen him and given him
high praise, which was printed in the newspapers and on the billposters.
He knew he was a famous flea who could support a Professor, yes, a whole
household.

Proud he was and famous he was. Yet when he and the Professor traveled
they went by fourth-class railway carriages, which took them along just
as quickly as those of the first-class. They made a secret pledge to
each other that they would never separate. Neither of them would marry.
The flea would remain a bachelor and the Professor a widower. That made
them even.

"Where one has the best luck," said the Professor, "one ought not go
back a second time." He was a student of human nature, which is a
science in itself. At length he had traveled through all countries
except the savage ones, and to those he decided to go. There they eat
Christian men. The Professor knew this, but then he was not much of a
Christian, and the flea was not much of a man, so he thought they might
venture successfully into the wilds, and make a lot of money.

They traveled by steamship and they traveled by sailboat. The flea
performed his trick along the way in exchange for free passage, and thus
they came to the country of savages. Here a little Princess ruled the
land. She was only eight years old, but she ruled just the same. She had
taken away the power from her papa and mamma, for she had a will of her
own and was uncommonly beautiful, and uncommonly rude.

As soon as the flea presented arms and fired off his cannon, she took
such a fancy to him that she cried, "Him or nobody!" She fell madly in
love with the flea, and she was already a madcap in all other respects.

"My sweet, level-headed little child - " her papa said, "if only
there were some way to make a man of him."

"Leave that to me, old fellow," said she, which was no way for a
little Princess to talk to her papa, but then she was a savage. She set
the flea on her fair hand:

"Now you are a man, ruling with me, but you must do what I want you to
do, or I shall kill you and eat the Professor."

The Professor had a large room to lice in, with walls made of sugar
cane. He could have licked them, but he didn't care for sweets. He had
a hammock to sleep in, and that reminded him of being in a balloon,
where he had always wanted to be. He thought of this continually.

The flea lived with the Princess. He sat upon her delicate hand or on
her fair neck. She had taken a hair from her head and made the Professor
fasten it to the flea's leg, and kept it tied to the big red coral
pendant which hung from the tip of her ear. What a delightful time the
Princess did have, and the flea too, she thought.

The Professor was not so delighted. He was a traveler, who liked to ride
from town to town, and to read in the newspapers about how persevering
and ingenious he had been to teach the flea tricks of human behavior.
Day in and day out he lay lazily in his hammock. He ate good food: fresh
bird's eggs, elephant eyes, and fried giraffe legs. Cannibals do not
live entirely on human flesh. No, that is a specisl delicacy!

"Shoulder of child with pepper sauce," said the Princess's mamma,
"is the most delicate."

The Professor was bored with it all, and preferred to leave this savage
land, but his flea he must take with him, for it was his wonder and his
bread and butter. How could he catch it? How could he get hold of it?
This was not an easy thing to do. He racked his wits, and at last he
declared:

"Now I have it! Papa of the Princess, give me something to do. Let me
teach your people to present themselves before Your Royal Highness. This
is what is known as culture in the great and powerful nations of the
earth."

"Can I learn to do that too?" the Princess's papa asked.

"It's not quite proper," the Professor told him, "but I shall teach
your Savage Papaship to fire off a cannon. It goes off with a bang. One
sits high in the air, and then off it goes or down you come."

"Let me bang it off," the Princess's papa begged. But in all the land
there was no cannon, except the one the flea had brought with him - and
that was so tiny.

"I shall cast a bigger one," said the Professor. "Just give me the
means to do so. I must have fine silk cloth, a needle and thread, and
rope and cordage, besides stomach drops for the balloon. Stomach drops
blow a person up so easily and give one the heaves. They are what make
the report in the cannon's stomach."

"By all means." The Princess's papa gave him everything that he
asked. The whole court, and all the populace gathered together to see
the casting of the big cannon. The Profesor did not call them until he
had the ballon all ready to be filled and to go up. The flea sat there
upon the Princess's hand, and looked on as the ballon was filled. It
swelled out and became so violent that they could scarcely hold it down.

"I must take it up in the air to cool it off," said the Professor who
took his seat in the basket that hung underneath.

"But - I cannot steer it alone, I must have a trained companion to help
me. There is no one here who can do that except the flea." - "I am not
at all willing to permit it," said the Princes, but she held out her
hand and gave the flea to the Professor, who placed it on his wrist.

"Let go the lines and ropes!" he shouted. "Now the balloon is going
up." They thought he said "the cannon." So the balloon went higher
and higher, up above the clouds and far away from that savage land.

The little Princess, her family, and all of her subjects sat and waited.
They are waiting there still, and if you don't believe this, just you
take a journey to the country of savages. Every child there is talking
about the Professor and the flea, whom they expect back as soon as the
cannon cools off.

But they won't be back. They are at home here with us. They are in
their native land. They travel by rail, first-class, not fourth. For
they have a great success, an enormous balloon. Nobody asks them how
they got their balloon, or where it came from. They are wealthy folk
now - oh, most respectable folk - the flea and the Professor.
