## A rose from Homer's grave 

All the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale for the
rose in the silent starlight night. The winged songster serenades the
fragrant flowers.

Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loaded camels,
proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath the lofty pines
over holy ground, I saw a hedge of roses. The turtle-dove flew among the
branches of the tall trees, and as the sunbeams fell upon her wings,
they glistened as if they were mother-of-pearl. On the rose-bush grew a
flower, more beautiful than them all, and to her the nightingale sung of
his woes; but the rose remained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a
tear of sympathy on her leaves. At last she bowed her head over a heap
of stones, and said, "Here rests the greatest singer in the world; over
his tomb will I spread my fragrance, and on it I will let my leaves fall
when the storm scatters them. He who sung of Troy became earth, and from
that earth I have sprung. I, a rose from the grave of Homer, am too
lofty to bloom for a nightingale." Then the nightingale sung himself to
death. A camel-driver came by, with his loaded camels and his black
slaves; his little son found the dead bird, and buried the lovely
songster in the grave of the great Homer, while the rose trembled in the
wind.

The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely round
her, and dreamed: and this was her dream.

It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near who had
undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of Homer. Among the strangers was a
minstrel from the north, the home of the clouds and the brilliant lights
of the aurora borealis. He plucked the rose and placed it in a book, and
carried it away into a distant part of the world, his fatherland. The
rose faded with grief, and lay between the leaves of the book, which he
opened in his own home, saying, "Here is a rose from the grave of
Homer."

Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the wind. A drop
of dew fell from the leaves upon the singer's grave. The sun rose, and
the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever. The day was hot, and she
was still in her own warm Asia. Then footsteps approached, strangers,
such as the rose had seen in her dream, came by, and among them was a
poet from the north; he plucked the rose, pressed a kiss upon her fresh
mouth, and carried her away to the home of the clouds and the northern
lights. Like a mummy, the flower now rests in his "Iliad," and, as in
her dream, she hears him say, as he opens the book, "Here is a rose
from the grave of Homer."
