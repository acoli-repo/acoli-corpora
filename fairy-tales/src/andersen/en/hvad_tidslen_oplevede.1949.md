## What happened to the thistle 

Adjoining the rich estate was a lovely and beautifully kept garden of
rare trees and flowers. Guests at the estate enjoyed this fine garden
and praised it. People from the countryside all round about and
townspeople as well would come every Sunday and holiday to ask if they
might see the garden. Even whole schools made excursions to it.

Just outside the fence that separated the garden from a country lane,
there grew a very large thistle. It was so unusually big with such
vigorous, full-foliaged branches rising from the root that it well
deserved to be called a thistle bush. No one paid any attention to her
except one old donkey that pulled the dairymaid's cart. He would
stretch his old neck toward the thistle and say, "You're a beauty.
I'd like to eat you!" But his tether was not long enough to let him
reach the thistle and eat her.

There was a big party at the manor house. Among the guests were fine
aristocratic relations from the capital - charming young girls, and
among them was a young lady who had come from a foreign land, all the
way from Scotland. Her family was old, and noble, and rich in lands and
gold. She was a bride well worth winning, thought more than one young
man, and their mothers thought so too.

The young people amused themselves on the lawn, where they played
croquet. As they strolled about in the garden, each young lady plucked a
flower and put in a young man's buttonhole. The young lady from
Scotland looked all around her for a flower. But none of them suited her
until she happened to look over the fence and saw the big, flourishing
thistle bush, full of deep purple, healthy-looking flowers. When she saw
them she smiled, and asked the young heir of the household to pick one
of them for her.

"That is Scotland's flower," she said. "It blooms on my country's
coat of arms. That's the flower for me."

He plucked the best flower of the thistle, and pricked his finger in the
process as much as if he had torn the blossom from the thorniest rose
bush.

When she put it in his buttonhole, he considered it a great honor. Every
other young man would gladly have given his lovely garden flower for any
blossom from the slender fingers of the girl from Scotland. If the heir
of the household felt himself highly honored, how much more so the
thistle! She felt as full as if the sunshine and dew went through her.

"I must be more important than I thought," she said to herself. "I
really belong inside, not outside the fence. One gets misplaced in the
world, but I now have one of my offspring not only over the fence but
actually in a buttonhole!"

To every one of her buds that bloomed, the thistle bush told what had
happened. Not many days went by before she heard important news. She
heard it not from passers-by, nor from the chirping of little birds, but
from the air itself, which collects sounds and carries them far and
wide - from the shadiest walks of the garden and from the furthest rooms
of the manor, where doors stood ajar and windows were left open. She
heard that the young man who got the thistle flower from the slender
fingers of the girl from Scotland, now had won her heart and hand. They
made a fine couple, and it was a good match.

"I brought that about," the thistle believed, thinking of how her
flower had been chosen for the gentleman's buttonhole. Each new bud
that opened was told of this wonderful happening.

"Undoubtedly I shall now be transplanted into the garden," thought the
thistle. "Perhaps they will even pinch me into a flowerpot, which is
the highest honor of all." She thought about this so long that at
length she said with full and firm conviction, "I am to be planted in a
flowerpot."

Every little thistle bud which opened was promised that it too would be
put in a pot, perhaps even in a buttonhole, which was the highest it
could hope to go. But not one of them reached a flowerpot, much less a
buttonhole. They lived upon light and air. By day they drank sunshine,
by night they drank dew, and were visited by bees and wasps who came in
search of a dowry - the honey of the flower. And they took away the
honey, but left the flowers behind.

"Such a gang of robbers!" said the thistle bush. "I'd like to stick
a thorn through them, but I can't."

Her flowers faded and fell away, but new ones came in their place. "You
have come as if you were called for," the thistle bush told them. "I
expect to cross the fence any minute now."

A couple of innocent daisies and some tall, narrow-leaved canary grass
listened with deepest admiration, and believed everything that they
heard. The old donkey, who had to pull the milk cart, looked longingly
at the blooming thistle bush and reached out for it, but his tether was
too short.

The thistle thought so hard and so long about the Scotch thistle, whom
she considered akin to her, that she began to believe that she herself
had come from Scotland and that it was her own ancestors who had grown
on the Scottish arms. This was toplofty thinking, but then tall thistles
are apt to think tall thought.

"Sometimes one is of more illustrious ancestry than he ventures to
suppose," said a nettle which grew near-by. It had a notion that it
could be transformed into fine muslin if properly handled.

Summer went by, and fall went by, and the leaves fell from the trees.
The flowers were more colorful, but less fragrant. On the other side of
the fence the gardener's boy sang:

"Up the hill and down the hill,
That's the way the world goes still."
And the young fir trees in the woods began to look forward to Christmas,
though Christmas was a long time off.

"Here I still stay," said the thistle. "It is as if nobody thinks of
me any more, yet it was I who made the match. They were engaged, and now
they have been married. That was eight days ago. But I haven't
progressed a single step - how can I?"

Several weeks went by. The thistle had one last, lonely flower. Large
and full, it grew low, near the root. The cold wind blew over it, its
color faded, its splendor departed. Only the thistle-shaped cup
remained, as large as an artichoke blossom, and as silvery as a
sunflower.

The young couple, who now were man and wife, came down the garden walk
along the fence. The bride looked over the fence, and said, "Why, there
still stands the big thistle, but it hasn't a flower left."

"Yes, there's the ghost of one - the very last one." Her husband
pointed to the silvery shell of the flower - a flower itself.

"Isn't it lovely!" she said. "We must have one just like that carved
around the frame of our picture."

Once again the young man had to climb the fence, and pluck the silvery
shell of the thistle flower. It pricked his fingers well, because he had
called it a ghost. Then it was brought into the garden, to the mansion,
and to the parlor. There hung a large painting - "The Newly Married
Couple!" In the groom's buttonhole a thistle was painted. They spoke
of that thistle flower, and they spoke of this thistle shell, this last
silvered, shining flower of the thistle which they had brought in with
them, and which was to be copied in the carving of the frame. The air
carried their words about, far and wide.

"What strange things can happen to one," said the thistle. "My oldest
child was put in a buttonhole, and my youngest in a picture frame. I
wonder where I shall go."

The old donkey by the roadside looked long and lovingly at the thistle.
"Come to me, my sweet," he said. "I cannot come to you because my
tether is not long enough."

But the thistle did not answer. She grew more and more thoughtful, and
she thought on right up to Christmas time, when this flower came of all
her thinking:

"When one's children are safe inside, a mother may be content to stand
outside the fence."

"That's a most honorable thought," said the sunbeam. "You too shall
also have a good place."

"In a flowerpot or in a frame?" the thistle asked.

"In a fairy tale," said the sunbeam. And here it is.
