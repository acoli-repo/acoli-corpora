## The swan's nest 

Between the Baltic and the North Sea there lies an old swan's nest,
wherein swans are born and have been born that shall never die.

In olden times a flock of swans flew over the Alps to the green plains
around Milan, where it was delightful to dwell. This flight of swans men
called the Lombards. Another flock, with shining plumage and honest
eyes, soared southward to Byzantium; the swans established themselves
there close by the Emperor's throne, and spread their wings over him as
shields to protect him. They received the name of Varangians.

On the coast of France there sounded a cry of fear, for the
blood-stained swans that came from the North with fire under their
wings; and the people prayed, "Heaven deliver us from the wild
Northmen."

On the fresh sward of England stood the Danish swan by the open
seashore, with the crown of three kingdoms on his head; and he stretched
out his golden sceptre over the land.

The heathens on the Pomerian coast bent the knee, and the Danish swans
came with the banner of the Cross and with the drawn sword.

"That was in the very old times," you say.

In later days two mighty swans have been seen to fly from the nest.

A light shone far through the air, far over the lands of the earth; the
swan, with the strong beating of his wings, scattered the twilight
mists, and the starry sky was seen, and it was as if it came nearer to
the earth. That was the swan Tycho Brahe.

"Yes, then," you say; "but in our own days?" We have seen swan after
swan soar by in glorious flight. One let his pinions glide over the
strings of the golden harp, and it resounded through the North.
Norway's mountains seemed to rise higher in the sunlight of former
days; there was a rustling among the pine trees and the birches; the
gods of the North, the heroes, and the noble women, showed themselves in
the dark forest depths.

We have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble crag, so that it
burst, and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the stone stepped out to
the sunny day, and men in the lands round about lifted up their heads to
behold these mighty forms.

We have seen a third swan spinning the thread of thought that is
fastened from country to country round the world, so that the word may
fly with lightning speed from land to land.

And our Lord loves the old swan's nest between the Baltic and the North
Sea. And when the mighty birds come soaring through the air to destroy
it, even the callow young stand round in a circle on the margin of the
nest, and though their breasts may be struck so that their blood flows,
they bear it, and strike with their wings and their claws.

Centuries will pass by, swans will fly forth from the nest, men will see
them and hear them in the world, before it shall be said in spirit and
in truth, "This is the last swan, the last song from the swan's
nest."
