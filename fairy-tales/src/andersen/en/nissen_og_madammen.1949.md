## The goblin and the woman 

You know the Goblin, but do you know the Woman-the Gardener's wife? She
was very well read and knew poems by heart; yes, and she could write
them, too, easily, except that the rhymes-"clinchings," as she called
them-gave her a little trouble. She had the gift of writing and the gift
of speech; she could very well have been a parson or at least a
parson's wife.

"The earth is beautiful in her Sunday gown," she said, and this
thought she had expanded and set down in poetic form, with
"clinchings," making a poem that was so long and lovely.

The Assistant Schoolmaster, Mr. Kisserup (not that his name matters at
all), was her nephew, and on a visit to the Gardener's he heard the
poem. It did him good, he said, a lot of good. "You have soul, Madam,"
he said.

"Stuff and nonsense!" said the Gardener. "Don't be putting such
ideas in her head! Soul! A wife should be a body, a good, plain, decent
body, and watch the pot, to keep the porridge from burning."

"I can take the burnt taste out of the porridge with a bit of
charcoal," said the Woman. "And I can take the burnt taste out of you
with a little kiss. You pretend you don't think of anything but cabbage
and potatoes, but you love the flowers, too." Then she kissed him.
"Flowers are the soul!"

"Mind your pot!" he said, as he went off to the garden. That was his
pot, and he minded it.

But the Assistant Schoolmaster stayed on, talking to the woman. Her
lovely words, "Earth is beautiful," he made a whole sermon of, which
was his habit.

"Earth is beautiful, and it shall be subject unto you! was said, and we
became lords of the earth. One person rules with the mind, one with the
body; one comes into the world like an exclamation mark of astonishment,
another like a dash that denotes faltering thought, so that we pause and
ask, why is he here? One man becomes a bishop, another just a poor
assistant schoolmaster, but everything is for the best. Earth is
beautiful and always in her Sunday gown. That was a thought-provoking
poem, Madam, full of feeling and geography!"

"You have soul, Mr. Kisserup," said the Woman, "a great deal of soul,
I assure you. After talking with you, one clearly understands oneself."

And so they talked on, equally well and beautifully. But out in the
kitchen somebody else was talking, and that was the Goblin, the little
gray-dressed Goblin with the red cap-you know the fellow. The Goblin was
sitting in the kitchen, acting as pot watcher. He was talking, but
nobody heard him except the big black Pussycat-"Cream Thief," the
Woman called him.

The Goblin was mad at her because he had learned she didn't believe in
his existence. Of course, she had never seen him, but with all her
reading she ought to have realized he did exist and have paid him a
little attention. On Christmas Eve she never thought of setting out so
much as a spoonful of porridge for him, though all his ancestors had
received that, and even from women who had no learning at all. Their
porridge used to be so swimming with cream and butter that it made the
Cat's mouth water to hear about it.

"She calls me just a notion!" said the Goblin. "And that's more than
I can understand. In fact, she simply denies me! I've listened to her
saying so before, and again just now in there, where she's driveling to
that boy whipper, that Assistant Schoolmaster. I say with Pop, 'Mind
the pot!' That she doesn't do, so now I am going to make it boil
over!"

And the Goblin blew on the fire till it burned and blazed up.
"Surre-rurre-rup!" And the pot boiled over.

"And now I'm going to pick holes in Pop's socks," said the Goblin.
"I'll unravel a large piece, both in toe and heel, so she'll have
something to darn; that is, if she is not too busy writing poetry. Madam
Poetess, please darn Pop's stocking!"

The Cat sneezed; he had caught a cold, though he always wore a fur coat.

"I've opened the door to the larder," said the Goblin. "There's
boiled cream in there as thick as paste. If you won't have a lick I
will."

"If I am going to get all the blame and the whipping for it, anyway,"
said the Cat, "I'll lick my share of the cream."

"First a lick, then a kick!" said the Goblin. "But now I'm off to
the Assistant Schoolmaster's room, where I'll hang his suspenders on
the mirror, put his socks into the water pitcher, and make him think the
punch was too strong and has his brain in a whirl. Last night I sat on
the woodpile by the kennel. I have a lot of fun teasing the watchdog; I
let my legs dangle in front of him. The dog couldn't reach them, no
matter how hard he jumped; that made him mad, he barked and barked, and
I dingled and dangled; we made a lot of noise! The Assistant
Schoolmaster woke up and jumped out of bed three times, but he couldn't
see me,though he was wearing his spectacles. He always sleeps with his
spectacles on."

"Say mew when you hear the Woman coming," said the Cat. "I'm a
little deaf. I don't feel well today."

"You have the licking sickness," said the Goblin. "Lick away; lick
your sickness away. But be sure to wipe your whiskers, so the cream
won't show on it. I'm off to do a little eavesdropping."

So the Goblin stood behind the door, and the door stood ajar. There was
nobody in the parlor except the Woman and the Assistant Schoolmaster.
They were discussing things which, as the Assistant Schoolmaster so
nobly observed, ought to rank in every household above pots and pans-the
Gifts of the Soul.

"Mr. Kisserup," said the Woman, "since we are discussing this
subject, I'll show you something along that line which I've never yet
shown to a living soul-least of all a man. They're my smaller poems;
however, some of them are rather long. I have called them 'Clinchings
by a Danneqvinde.' You see, I am very fond of old Danish words!"

"Yes, we should hold onto them," said the Assistant Schoolmaster. "We
should root the German out of our language."

"That I am doing, too!" said the Woman. "You'll never hear me speak
of Kleiner or Butterteig;no, I call them fatty cakes and paste leaves."

Then she took a writing book, in a light green cover, with two blotches
of ink on it, from her drawer.

"There is much in this book that is serious," she said. "My mind
tends toward the melancholy. Here is my 'The Sign in the Night,' 'My
Evening Red,' and 'When I Got Klemmensen'-my husband; that one you
may skip over, though it has thought and feeling. 'The Housewife's
Duties' is the best one-sorrowful, like all the rest; that's my best
style. Only one piece is comical; it contains some lively thoughts-one
must indulge in them occasionally-thoughts about-now, you mustn't laugh
at me-thoughts about being a poetess! Up to now it has been a secret
between me and my drawer; now you know it, too, Mr. Kisserup. I love
poetry; it haunts me; it jeers, advises, and commands. That's what I
mean by my title, 'The Little Goblin.' You know the old peasants'
superstitions about the Goblin who is always playing tricks in the
house. I myself am the house, and my poetical feelings are the Goblin,
the spirit that possesses me. I have written about his power and
strength in 'The Little Goblin'; but you must promise with your hands
and lips never to give away my secret, either to my husband or to anyone
else. Read it loud, so that I can tell if you understand the meaning."

And the Assistant Schoolmaster read, and the Woman listened, and so did
the little Goblin. He was eavesdropping, you'll remember, and he came
just in time to hear the title 'The Little Goblin.'

"That's about me!" he said. "What could she have been written about
me? Oh, I'll pinch her! I'll chip her eggs, and pinch her chickens,
and chase the fat off her fatted calf! Just watch me do it!"

And then he listened with pursed lips and long ears; but when he heard
of the Goblin's power and glory, and his rule over the woman (she meant
poetry, you know, but the Goblin took the name literally), the little
fellow began grinnning more and more. His eyes brightened with delight;
then the corners of his mouth set sternly in lines of dignity; he drew
himself up on his toes a whole inch higher than usual; he was greatly
pleased with what was written about the Little Goblin.

"I've done her wrong! The Woman has soul and fine breeding! How, I
have done her wrong! She has put me into her 'Clinchings,' and
they'll be printed and read. Now I won't allow the Cat to drink her
cream; I'll do that myself! One drinks less than two, so that'll be a
saving; and that I shall do, and pay honor and respect to the Woman!"

"He's a man all right, that Goblin," said the old Cat. "Just one
sweet mew from the Woman, a mew about himself, and he immediately
changes his mind! She is a sly one, the Woman!"

But the Woman wasn't sly; it was just that the Goblin was a man.

If you can't understand this story, ask somebody to explain it to you;
but don't ask the Goblin or the Woman, either.
