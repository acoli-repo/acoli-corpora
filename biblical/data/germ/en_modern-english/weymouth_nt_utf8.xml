          <seg id="b.MAT.1.18" type="verse">The circumstances of the birth  of Jesus Christ were these. After his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they were united in marriage, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.1.19" type="verse">But Joseph her husband, being a  kind-hearted man and unwilling publicly to disgrace her, had determined to release her privately from the betrothal.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.1.24" type="verse">When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded, and brought home his wife,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.1.25" type="verse">but did not live with her until she had given birth to  a son. The child's name he called JESUS.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAT.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.1" type="verse">Now after the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judaea  in the reign of King Herod,  excitement was produced in Jerusalem by the arrival of certain  Magi from the east,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.2" type="verse">inquiring, "Where is the newly born king of the Jews? For we have seen his Star in the east, and have come here to do him homage."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.3" type="verse">Reports of this soon reached the king, and greatly agitated not only him but all the people of Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.4" type="verse">So he assembled all the  High Priests and Scribes of the people, and  anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.5" type="verse">"At Bethlehem in Judaea," they replied; "for so it stands written in the words of the Prophet,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.6" type="verse">&amp;lt;"`And thou,  Bethlehem in the land of Judah, by no means the least honorable art thou among  princely places in Judah! For from thee shall come a prince--one who shall be the Shepherd of My People Israel.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.7" type="verse">Thereupon Herod sent privately for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time  of the star's appearing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.8" type="verse">He then directed them to go to Bethlehem, adding, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and  do him homage."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.9" type="verse">After hearing what the king said, they went to Bethlehem, while,  strange to say, the star  they had seen in the east led them on until it came and stood over the place where the babe was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.10" type="verse">When they saw the star, the sight filled them with intense joy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.11" type="verse">So they entered the house; and when they  saw the babe  with His mother Mary, they prostrated themselves and did Him homage, and opening their treasure-chests offered gifts to Him--gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.12" type="verse">But being  forbidden by God in a dream to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by a different route.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.13" type="verse">When they were  gone, and angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise: take the babe and His mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there till I bring you word. For Herod is about to make search for the child in order to destroy Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.14" type="verse">So Joseph roused himself and took the babe and His mother by night and departed into Egypt.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.15" type="verse">There he remained till Herod's death, that what the Lord had said through the Prophet might be  fulfilled, &amp;lt;"Out of Egypt I called My Son."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.16" type="verse">Then Herod, finding that the Magi had trifled with him, was furious, and sent and massacred all the boys under two years of age, in Bethlehem and all its neighbourhood, according to the date he had so carefully ascertained from the Magi.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.17" type="verse">Then were these words, spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah,  fulfilled,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.18" type="verse">&amp;lt;"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation: It was Rachel  bewailing her children, and she refused to be comforted because there were no more."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.19" type="verse">But after Herod's death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said to him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.20" type="verse">"Rise from sleep, and take the child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.21" type="verse">So he roused himself and took the child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.22" type="verse">But hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod on the throne of Judaea, he was afraid to go there; and being instructed  by God in a dream he withdrew into Galilee,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.2.23" type="verse">and went and settled in a town called Nazareth, in order that these words spoken through the Prophets might be fulfilled, &amp;lt;"He shall be called a  Nazarene."&amp;gt;</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAT.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.1" type="verse">About this time John  the Baptist made his appearance, preaching in the Desert of Judaea.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.2" type="verse">"Repent," he said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.3" type="verse">He it is who was spoken of through the Prophet Isaiah when he said, &amp;lt;"The voice of one crying aloud,  `In the desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.4" type="verse">This man John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a loincloth of leather; and he lived upon locusts and wild honey.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.5" type="verse">Then large numbers of people went out to him--people from Jerusalem and from all Judaea, and from the whole of the Jordan valley--</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.6" type="verse">and were baptized by him in the Jordan, making full confession of their sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.7" type="verse">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he exclaimed, "O vipers'  brood, who has  warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.8" type="verse">Therefore let your lives prove your  change of heart;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.9" type="verse">and  do not imagine that you can say  to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can  raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.10" type="verse">And already the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree which does not produce good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.11" type="verse">I indeed am baptizing you  in water  on a profession of repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I: His sandals I am not worthy to carry for a moment; He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.12" type="verse">His winnowing-shovel is in His hand, and He will make a thorough clearance of His threshing-floor, gathering His wheat into the storehouse, but  burning up the  chaff in unquenchable fire."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.13" type="verse">Just at that time Jesus, coming from Galilee to the Jordan, presents Himself to John to be baptized by him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.14" type="verse">John  protested. "It is I," he said, "who have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.15" type="verse">"Let it be so on this occasion," Jesus replied; "for so we ought to fulfil every religious duty." Then he consented;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.16" type="verse">and Jesus was baptized, and immediately went up from the water.  At that moment the heavens  opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a  dove and alighting upon Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.3.17" type="verse">while a voice came from Heaven, saying, "This is My Son, the dearly loved, in whom is My delight."</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAT.4" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.1" type="verse">At that time Jesus was  led up by the Spirit into the Desert in order to be tempted by the Devil.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.2" type="verse">There He fasted for forty days and nights; and after that He suffered from hunger.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.3" type="verse">So the Tempter came and said,  "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to turn into loaves."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.4" type="verse">"It is written," replied Jesus, &amp;lt;"`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live, but on whatsoever God shall appoint.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.5" type="verse">Then the Devil took Him to the Holy City and caused Him to stand on the roof of the  Temple,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.6" type="verse">and said,  "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down; for it is written, &amp;lt;"`To His angels He will give orders concerning thee, and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.7" type="verse">"Again it is written," replied Jesus,  &amp;lt;"`Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.8" type="verse">Then the Devil took Him to the top of an exceedingly lofty mountain, from which he caused Him to see all the Kingdoms of the world and their splendour,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.9" type="verse">and said to Him, "All this I will give you,  if you will kneel down and do me homage."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.10" type="verse">"Begone, Satan!" Jesus replied; "for it is written, &amp;lt;`To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.11" type="verse">Thereupon the Devil left Him, and angels  at once came and ministered to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.12" type="verse">Now when Jesus heard that John was  thrown into prison, He withdrew into Galilee,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.13" type="verse">and leaving Nazareth He went and settled at  Capernaum, a town by the  Lake on the frontiers of Zebulun and Naphtali,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.14" type="verse">in order that these words, spoken through the Prophet Isaiah, might be fulfilled,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.15" type="verse">&amp;lt;"Zebulun's land and Naphtali's land; the road by the  Lake; the country beyond the Jordan;  Galilee of the Nations!</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.16" type="verse">The people who were  dwelling in darkness have seen a brilliant light; and on those who were dwelling in the  region of the shadow of death, on them light has dawned."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.17" type="verse">From that time Jesus began to preach. "Repent," He said, "for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.18" type="verse">And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw two brothers--Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew--throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fishers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.19" type="verse">And He said to them, "Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.20" type="verse">So they immediately left their nets and followed Him. As He went further on,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.21" type="verse">He saw two other brothers, James the son of  Zabdi and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zabdi mending their nets; and He called them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.22" type="verse">And they at once left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.23" type="verse">Then Jesus  travelled through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming  the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.24" type="verse">Thus His fame spread through all Syria; and they brought all the sick to Him, the people who were  suffering from various diseases and pains--demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He cured them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.4.25" type="verse">And great crowds followed Him, coming from Galilee, from the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from beyond the district on the other side of the Jordan.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAT.5" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.1" type="verse">Seeing the multitude of people, Jesus went up  the Hill. There He  seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.2" type="verse">He proceeded to teach them, and said:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.3" type="verse">"Blessed are the  poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.4" type="verse">"Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.5" type="verse">"Blessed are  the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession of the earth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.6" type="verse">"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.7" type="verse">"Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.8" type="verse">"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.9" type="verse">"Blessed are the peacemakers, for  it is they who will be recognized as sons of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.10" type="verse">"Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.11" type="verse">"Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you, and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.12" type="verse">Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens; for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.13" type="verse">"*You* are the salt of the earth; but if salt has become  tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away and trodden on by the passers by.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.14" type="verse">*You* are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built on a hill-top.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.15" type="verse">Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand; and then it gives light to all in the house.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.16" type="verse">Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see  your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.17" type="verse">"Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate  the Law or the Prophets: I have not come to abrogate them but to give them their completion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.18" type="verse">Solemnly I tell you that until  Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.19" type="verse">Whoever therefore  breaks one of these least commandments and teaches  others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.20" type="verse">For I assure you that unless  your righteousness  greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.21" type="verse">"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, &amp;lt;`Thou shalt not commit murder',&amp;gt; and whoever commits murder will be answerable to  the magistrate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.22" type="verse">But I say to you that every one who becomes  angry with his brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says to his brother  `Raca,' shall be answerable to the  Sanhedrin; and that whoever says, `You  fool!' shall be liable to the  Gehenna of Fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.5.23" type="verse">If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.13.1" type="verse">That same day Jesus had left the house and was sitting on the shore of the Lake,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.2" type="verse">when a vast multitude of people crowded round Him. He therefore went on board a boat and sat there, while all the people stood on the shore.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.3" type="verse">He then spoke many things to them in  figurative language. "The sower  goes out," He said, "to sow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.4" type="verse">As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.5" type="verse">Some falls on rocky ground, where it has but scanty soil. It quickly shows itself above ground, because it has no depth of earth;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.6" type="verse">but when the sun is risen, it is scorched by the heat, and through having no root it withers up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.7" type="verse">Some falls  among the thorns; but the thorns spring up and stifle it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.8" type="verse">But a portion falls upon good ground, and  gives a return, some a hundred for one, some sixty, some thirty.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.9" type="verse">Listen, every one who has ears!" </seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.10" type="verse">(And His disciples  came and asked Him, "Why do you speak to them in figurative language?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.11" type="verse">"Because," He replied, "while to you it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of the Heavens, to them it is not.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.12" type="verse">For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, from him even what he has shall be taken away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.13" type="verse">I speak to them in figurative language for this reason, that while looking they do not see, and while hearing they neither hear nor understand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.14" type="verse">And in regard to them the prophecy of Isaiah is receiving signal fulfilment: &amp;lt;"`You will hear and hear and by no means understand, and you will look and look and by no means see.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.15" type="verse">For this people's  mind  is stupefied, their hearing has become dull, and their eyes they have closed; to prevent their ever seeing with their eyes, or hearing with their ears, or understanding with their minds, and turning back,  so that I might heal them.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.16" type="verse">"But as for you, blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.17" type="verse">For I solemnly tell you that many Prophets and holy men have longed to see the sights you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the words you hear, and have not heard them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.18" type="verse">"To you then I will explain the parable of the Sower.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.19" type="verse">When a man hears the Message concerning the Kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil one comes and catches away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who  has received the seed by the road-side.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.20" type="verse">He who  has received the seed on the rocky ground is the man who hears the Message and immediately receives it with joy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.21" type="verse">It has struck no root, however, within him. He continues for a time, but when suffering comes, or persecution, because of the Message, he at once stumbles and falls.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.22" type="verse">He who  has received the seed among the thorns is the man who hears the Message, but the cares of the present age and the delusions of riches quite stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.23" type="verse">But he who  has received the seed on good ground is he who hears and understands. Such hearers give a return, and yield one a hundred for one, another sixty, another thirty.")</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.24" type="verse">Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to a man who has sown good seed in his field,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.25" type="verse">but  during the night his enemy comes, and over the first seed he sows darnel among the wheat, and goes away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.26" type="verse">But when the blade shoots up and the grain is formed, then appears the darnel also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.27" type="verse">"So the farmer's  men come and ask him, "`Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed on your land? Where then does the darnel come from?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.28" type="verse">"`Some enemy has done this,' he said. "`Shall we go, and collect it?' the  men inquire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.29" type="verse">"`No,' he replied, `for fear that while collecting the darnel you should at the same time root up the wheat with it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.30" type="verse">Leave both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest-time I will direct the reapers, Collect the darnel  first, and make it up into bundles to burn it, but  bring  all the wheat into my barn.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.31" type="verse">Another parable He put before them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like a mustard-seed, which a man takes and sows in his ground.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.32" type="verse">It is  the smallest of all seeds, and yet when full-grown it is larger than any  herb and forms a tree, so that the birds come and build in its branches."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.33" type="verse">Another parable He spoke to them. "The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said, "is like  yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, for it to work there till the whole mass has risen."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.34" type="verse">All this Jesus spoke to the people in figurative language, and except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.35" type="verse">in fulfilment of the saying of  the Prophet, &amp;lt;"I will open my mouth in figurative language, I will utter things kept hidden since the creation of all things."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.36" type="verse">When He had dismissed the people and had returned to the house, His disciples came to Him with the request, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel sown in the field."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.13.38" type="verse">the field is the world; the good seed--these are the  sons of the Kingdom; the darnel, the sons of the Evil one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.39" type="verse">The enemy who sows the darnel is *the Devil*; the harvest is the  Close of the Age; the reapers are the angels.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.40" type="verse">As then the darnel is collected together and burnt up with fire, so will it be at the Close of the Age.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.41" type="verse">The Son of Man will commission His angels, and they will gather out of His Kingdom all  causes of sin and all who violate His laws;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.13.43" type="verse">Then will the righteous shine out  like the sun in  their Father's Kingdom. Listen, every one who has ears! </seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.44" type="verse">"The Kingdom of the Heavens is like treasure buried in the open country, which a man finds, but buries again, and, in his joy about it, goes and sells all he has and buys that piece of ground.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.45" type="verse">"Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like  a jewel merchant who is in quest of choice pearls.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.46" type="verse">He finds one most costly pearl; he goes away; and though it costs all he has, he buys it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.47" type="verse">"Again the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a draw-net let down into the sea, which encloses fish of all sorts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.48" type="verse">When full, they haul it up on the beach, and sit down and collect the good fish in baskets, while  the worthless they throw away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.49" type="verse">So will it be at the  Close of the Age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.50" type="verse">and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.51" type="verse">"Have you understood all this?" He asked. "Yes," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.52" type="verse">"Therefore," He said, "remember that every Scribe well trained for the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.53" type="verse">Jesus concluded this series of parables and then departed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.54" type="verse">And He came into His own  country and proceeded to teach in their synagogue, so that they were filled with astonishment and exclaimed, "Where did he obtain such wisdom, and these wondrous powers?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.13.55" type="verse">Is not  this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon and Judah?</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.13.57" type="verse">So they  turned angrily away from Him. But Jesus said to them, "There is no prophet left without honour except in his own country and among his own  family."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.14.1" type="verse">About that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.14.3" type="verse">For Herod had arrested John, and had put him in chains, and imprisoned him, for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.4" type="verse">because John had persistently said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.5" type="verse">And he would have liked to put him to death, but was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a Prophet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.6" type="verse">But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before all the company, and so pleased Herod</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.14.8" type="verse">So she, instigated by her mother, said, "Give me here on a dish the head of John the Baptist."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.9" type="verse">The king was deeply vexed, yet because of his repeated oath and of the guests at his table he ordered it to be given her,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.14.11" type="verse">The head was brought on a dish and given to the young girl, and she took it to her mother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.12" type="verse">Then John's disciples went and removed the body and buried  it, and came and informed Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.13" type="verse">Upon receiving these tidings, Jesus went away by boat to an uninhabited and secluded district; but the people heard of it and followed Him in crowds from the towns by land.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.14" type="verse">So Jesus  went out and saw an immense multitude, and felt compassion for them, and cured those of them who were out of health.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.15" type="verse">But when  evening was come, the disciples came to Him and said, "This is an uninhabited place, and the best of the day is now gone; send the people away to go into the villages and buy something to eat."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.16" type="verse">"They need not go away," replied Jesus; "you yourselves must give them something to eat."</seg>

Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.20" type="verse">So all ate, and were fully satisfied. The  broken portions that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.21" type="verse">Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.22" type="verse">Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him to dismiss the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.23" type="verse">When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude.  Night came on, and he was there alone.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.24" type="verse">Meanwhile the boat was  far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed by the waves, the wind being adverse.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.14.30" type="verse">But when he  felt  the wind he  grew frightened, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Master, save me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.14.31" type="verse">Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him, saying to him, "O little faith, why did you doubt?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.15.3" type="verse">"Why do you, too," He retorted, "transgress God's commands  for the sake of  your tradition?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.15.4" type="verse">For God said, &amp;lt;`Honour thy father and thy mother';&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;`Let him who  reviles father or mother  be certainly put to death';&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.15.5" type="verse">but you--this is what you say: `If a man says to his father or mother, That is  consecrated, whatever it is, which otherwise you should have received from me--</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.15.21" type="verse">Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.15.22" type="verse">Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and  persistently cried out, "Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly harassed by a demon."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.15.23" type="verse">But He answered her not a word. Then the disciples interposed, and begged Him, saying, "Send her away because she keeps crying behind us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.15.24" type="verse">"I have only been sent to the  lost sheep of the house of Israel," He replied.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.17.1" type="verse">Six day later, Jesus took with Him Peter and the brothers James and John, and brought them up  a high mountain to a solitary place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.2" type="verse">There in their presence His form underwent a change; His face shone like the sun, and His raiment became as white as the light.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.3" type="verse">And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them conversing with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.4" type="verse">Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master,  we are thankful to you that we are here. If you approve, I will put up three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.5" type="verse">He was still speaking when a luminous cloud  spread over them; and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said, "This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight. Listen to Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.6" type="verse">On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces and were filled with terror.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.7" type="verse">But Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Rouse yourselves and have no fear."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.8" type="verse">So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.9" type="verse">As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them. "Tell no one," He said, "of the sight you have seen till the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.10" type="verse">"Why then," asked the disciples, "do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.11" type="verse">"Elijah was indeed to come," He replied, "and would reform everything.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.12" type="verse">But I tell you that he has already come, and they did not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose. And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them in a similar way."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.13" type="verse">Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist about whom He had spoken to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.14" type="verse">When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.17.17" type="verse">"O unbelieving and  perverse generation!" replied Jesus; "how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? Bring him  to me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.18" type="verse">Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him; and the boy was cured from that moment.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.17.21" type="verse">But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by prayer and fasting."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.22" type="verse">As they were  travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.17.25" type="verse">"Yes," he replied, and then went into the house. But before he spoke a word Jesus said, "What think you, Simon? From whom do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax? from their own children, or from others?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.17.26" type="verse">"From others," he replied. "Then  the children go free," said Jesus.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.20.7" type="verse">"`Because  no one has hired us,' they replied. "`You also, go into the vineyard,' he said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.8" type="verse">"When evening came, the master said to his steward, "`Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.'</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.20.11" type="verse">So when they had received it, they grumbled against the employer, saying,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.12" type="verse">"`These who came last  have done  only one hour's work, and  you have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole day and have borne the scorching heat.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.13" type="verse">"`My friend,' he answered to one of them, `I am doing you no injustice.  Did you not agree with me for a shilling?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.14" type="verse">Take your money and go. I choose to give this last comer just as much as I give you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.20.17" type="verse">Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.18" type="verse">"We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.20.20" type="verse">Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.21" type="verse">"What is it you desire?" He asked. "Command," she replied, "that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in  your Kingdom."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.22" type="verse">"None of you know what you are asking for," said Jesus; "can you drink  out of the cup  from which I am about to drink?" "We can," they replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.23" type="verse">"You shall drink out of my cup," He said, "but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been  prepared by my Father."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.24" type="verse">The  other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused  against the two brothers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.25" type="verse">But Jesus called them to Him, and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.26" type="verse">Not so  shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.20.28" type="verse">just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give His life as the  redemption-price  for many."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.29" type="verse">As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.30" type="verse">two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, "Sir, Son of David, pity us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.31" type="verse">The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. "O Sir, Son of David, pity us," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.32" type="verse">So Jesus stood still and called to them. "What shall I do for you?" He asked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.33" type="verse">"Sir, let our eyes be opened," they replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.20.34" type="verse">Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.21.1" type="verse">When they were come near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of the disciples on in front,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.2" type="verse">saying to them, "Go to the village you see facing you, and as you enter it you will find a she-ass tied up and a foal with her. Untie her and  bring them to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.3" type="verse">And if any one says anything to you, say,  `The Master needs them,' and he will at once send them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.4" type="verse">This  took place in order that the Prophet's prediction might be fulfilled:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.5" type="verse">&amp;lt;"Tell the  Daughter of Zion, `See, thy King is coming  to thee, gentle,  and yet mounted on an ass, even on a colt the  foal of a beast of burden.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.6" type="verse">So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.7" type="verse">they brought the she-ass and the foal, and threw their outer garments on them. So He sat on them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.8" type="verse">and most of the crowd kept spreading their garments along the road, while others  cut branches from the trees and  carpeted the road with them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.9" type="verse">and the multitudes--some of the people preceding Him and some following--sang aloud,  &amp;lt;"God save the Son of David! Blessings on Him who comes in the Lord's name! God in the highest Heavens save Him!"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.10" type="verse">When He thus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was thrown into commotion, every one inquiring, "Who is this?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.11" type="verse">"This is Jesus, the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee," replied the crowds.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.12" type="verse">Entering  the Temple, Jesus drove out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the money-changers' tables and the seats of the pigeon-dealers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.13" type="verse">"It is written," He said, &amp;lt;"`My House shall be called  the House of Prayer',&amp;gt; but you are making it &amp;lt;a robbers' cave."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.14" type="verse">And  the blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple, and He cured them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.15" type="verse">But when the High Priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done and the children who were crying aloud in the Temple, &amp;lt;"God save the Son of David,"&amp;gt; they were filled with indignation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.16" type="verse">"Do you hear," they asked Him, "what these children are saying?" "Yes," He replied; "have you never read, &amp;lt;`Out of the mouths of infants and of babes at the breast Thou hast brought forth the praise which is due'?"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.17" type="verse">So He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and passed the night there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.18" type="verse">Early in the morning  as He was on His way to return to the city He was hungry,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.19" type="verse">and seeing  a fig-tree on the road-side He went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. "On you," He said, "no fruit shall ever again grow." And immediately the fig-tree withered away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.20" type="verse">When the disciples saw it they exclaimed in astonishment, "How instantaneously the fig-tree has withered away!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.21" type="verse">"I solemnly tell you," said Jesus, "that if you have an unwavering faith, you shall not only perform such a miracle as this of the fig-tree, but that even if you say to this mountain, `Be thou lifted up and hurled into the sea,' it shall be done;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.22" type="verse">and everything, whatever it be, that you ask for in your prayers, if you have faith, you shall obtain."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.23" type="verse">He entered the Temple; and while He was teaching, the High Priests and the Elders of the people came to Him and asked Him, "By  what authority are you doing  these things? and who gave you this authority?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.24" type="verse">"And I also have a question to ask *you*," replied Jesus, "and if you answer me, I in turn will tell you by what authority I do these things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.25" type="verse">John's Baptism, whence was it? --had it a heavenly or a human origin?" So they debated the matter among themselves. "If we say `a heavenly origin,'" they argued, "he will say, `Why then did you not believe him?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.26" type="verse">and if we say `a human origin' we have the people to fear, for they all hold John to have been a Prophet."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.27" type="verse">So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."  "Nor do I tell you," He replied, "by what authority I do these things."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.28" type="verse">"But give me your judgement. There was a man who had two  sons. He came to the elder of them, and said, "`My  son, go and work in the vineyard to-day.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.29" type="verse">"`I will not,' he replied. "But afterwards he was sorry, and went.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.30" type="verse">He came to the second and spoke in the same manner. His answer was, "`I will go, Sir.' "But he did not go.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.31" type="verse">Which of the two did as his father desired?"  "The first," they said. "I solemnly tell you,' replied Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners are entering the Kingdom of God  in front of you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.32" type="verse">For John came to you observing all sorts of ritual, and you put no faith in him: the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners did put faith in him, and you, though you saw this example set you, were not even afterwards sorry so as to believe him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.33" type="verse">"Listen to another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, made a fence round it, dug a wine-tank in it, and built a strong lodge; then let the place to vine-dressers, and went abroad.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.34" type="verse">When vintage-time approached, he sent his  servants to the vine-dressers to receive his share of the  grapes;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.35" type="verse">but the vine-dressers seized the servants, and one they cruelly beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.36" type="verse">Again he sent another party of servants more numerous than the first; and these they treated in the same manner.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.37" type="verse">Later still he sent to them  his son,  saying, "`They will respect my son.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.38" type="verse">"But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said to one another, "`Here is the heir: come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.39" type="verse">"So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.40" type="verse">When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.41" type="verse">"He will put the wretches to a wretched death," was the reply, "and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will render the produce to him at the vintage season."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.42" type="verse">"Have you never read in the Scriptures," said Jesus, &amp;lt;"`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone: this Cornerstone  came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes'?&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.43" type="verse">"That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation  that will exhibit the power  of it.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.21.45" type="verse">After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees perceived that He was speaking about them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.21.46" type="verse">but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet.</seg>

        <div id="b.MAT.22" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.1" type="verse">Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.2" type="verse">"The Kingdom of the Heavens," He said,  "may be compared to  a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.22.4" type="verse">"Again he sent other servants with a message to those who were invited. "`My  breakfast is now ready," he said, `my bullocks and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made: come to the wedding.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.5" type="verse">"They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country, another to his business;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.6" type="verse">and the rest seized the king's servants, maltreated them, and murdered them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.7" type="verse">So the king's anger was stirred, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.8" type="verse">Then he said to his servants, "`The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy of it.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.22.10" type="verse">"So they went out into the roads and gathered together all they  could find, both bad and good, and the  banqueting hall was filled with guests.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.11" type="verse">"Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.22.15" type="verse">Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.16" type="verse">So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians;  who said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you, for you  are not biased by men's wealth or rank.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.22.17" type="verse">Give us your judgement therefore: is it allowable for us to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.26.17" type="verse">On the first day of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus with the question, "Where shall we make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.18" type="verse">"Go into the city," He replied, "to a certain man, and tell him, `The Teacher says, My time is close at hand. It is at your house that I shall keep the Passover with my disciples.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.19" type="verse">The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and got the Passover ready.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.20" type="verse">When evening came, He  was at table with the twelve  disciples,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.21" type="verse">and the meal was proceeding, when Jesus said, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.22" type="verse">Intensely grieved they began one after another to ask Him, "Can it be I, Master?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.23" type="verse">"The one who has dipped his fingers in the bowl with me," He answered, "is the man who will betray me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.24" type="verse">The Son of Man is indeed going as is written concerning Him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man if he had  never been born."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.25" type="verse">Then Judas, the disciple who was betraying Him, asked, "Can it be I, Rabbi?"  "It is you," He replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.26" type="verse">During the meal Jesus took  a Passover biscuit, blessed it and broke it. He then gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it: it  is my body."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.27" type="verse">And He  took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, "Drink from it, all of you;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.28" type="verse">for this is my blood which is to be poured out for many for the remission of sins--the blood which ratifies  the Covenant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.29" type="verse">I tell you that I will never again take the produce of the vine till that day when I shall drink  the new wine with you in my Father's Kingdom."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.30" type="verse">So they sang  the hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.31" type="verse">Then said Jesus, "This night all of you will stumble and fail in your fidelity to me; for it is written, &amp;lt;`I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered in all directions.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.32" type="verse">But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.33" type="verse">"All may stumble and fail," said Peter, "but I never will."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.34" type="verse">"In solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that this very night,  before the cock crows, you will three times disown me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.35" type="verse">"Even if I must die with you," declared Peter, "I will never disown you." In like manner protested all the disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.36" type="verse">Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, "Sit down here, whilst I go yonder and there pray."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.37" type="verse">And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zabdi. Then He began to be full of anguish and distress,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.38" type="verse">and He said to them, "My soul is  crushed with anguish to the very point of death; wait here, and keep awake with me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.39" type="verse">Going forward a short distance He fell on His face and prayed. "My Father," He said, "if it is possible, let this  cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou willest."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.40" type="verse">Then He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Alas, none of you could keep awake with me for even a single hour!</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.41" type="verse">Keep awake, and pray that you may not enter into temptation:  the spirit is  right willing, but the  body is frail."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.42" type="verse">Again a second time He went away and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is impossible for this cup to pass without my drinking it, Thy will be done."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.43" type="verse">He came and again found them asleep, for  they were very tired.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.44" type="verse">So He left them, and went away once more and prayed a third time, again using the same words.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.45" type="verse">Then He came to the disciples and said, "Sleep on and rest. See, the moment is close at hand when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.46" type="verse">Rouse yourselves. Let us be going. My betrayer is close at hand."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.47" type="verse">He had scarcely finished speaking when Judas came--one of the Twelve--accompanied by a great crowd of men armed with swords and bludgeons, sent by the High Priests and Elders of the People.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.48" type="verse">Now the betrayer had agreed upon a sign with them, to direct them. He had said, "The one whom I kiss is the man: lay hold of him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.49" type="verse">So he went straight to Jesus and said,  "Peace to you, Rabbi!" And he kissed Him  eagerly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.50" type="verse">"Friend," said Jesus,  "carry out your intention." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and seized Him firmly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.51" type="verse">But one of those with Jesus drew his sword and struck the High Priest's  servant, cutting off his ear.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.52" type="verse">"Put back your sword again," said Jesus, "for all who  draw the sword shall perish by the sword.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.53" type="verse">Or do you suppose I cannot entreat my Father and He would instantly  send to my help more than twelve legions of angels?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.54" type="verse">In that case how are the Scriptures to be fulfilled which declare that thus it must be?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.55" type="verse">Then said Jesus to the crowds, "Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and bludgeons to apprehend me? Day after day I  have been sitting teaching in the Temple, and you did not arrest me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.56" type="verse">But all this has taken place in order that the writings of the Prophets may be fulfilled." At this point the disciples all left Him and fled.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.57" type="verse">But the officers who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the Scribes and the Elders had assembled.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.58" type="verse">And Peter kept following Him at a distance, till he came even to the court of the High Priest's palace, where he entered and sat down among the  officers to see the issue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.59" type="verse">Meanwhile the High Priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.60" type="verse">but they could find none, although many false witnesses came forward. At length there came two</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.61" type="verse">who testified, "This man said, `I am able to pull down the Sanctuary of God and three days afterwards to build a new one.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.62" type="verse">Then the High Priest stood up and asked Him, "Have you no answer to make? What is it these men are saying in evidence against you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.63" type="verse">Jesus however remained silent. Again the High Priest addressed Him. "In the name of the  ever-living God," he said,  "I now put you on your oath. Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.64" type="verse">"I am He," replied Jesus. "But I tell you that,  later on, you will see &amp;lt;the Son of Man sitting at the right hand&amp;gt; of Omnipotence, &amp;lt;and coming on the clouds of the sky."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.65" type="verse">Then the High Priest tore his robes and exclaimed, "Impious language! What further need have we of witnesses! See, you have now heard the impiety.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.66" type="verse">What is your verdict?" "He deserves to die," they replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.67" type="verse">Then they spat in His face, and struck Him--some with the fist, some  with the open hand--</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.68" type="verse">while they taunted Him, saying, "Christ,  prove yourself a Prophet by telling us who it was that struck you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.69" type="verse">Peter meanwhile was sitting outside in the court of the palace, when  one of the maidservants came over to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.70" type="verse">He denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.71" type="verse">Soon afterwards he went out and stood in the gateway, when another girl saw him, and said, addressing the people there,  "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.72" type="verse">Again he denied it with an oath. "I do not know the man," he said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.73" type="verse">A short time afterwards the people  standing there came and said to Peter, "Certainly you too are one of them, for your brogue shows it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.74" type="verse">Then with curses and oaths he declared, "I do not know the man." Immediately a cock crowed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.26.75" type="verse">and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, how He had said, "Before the cock crows you will three times disown me." And he went out and wept  aloud, bitterly.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAT.27" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.1" type="verse">When morning came all the High Priests and the Elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put Him to death;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.2" type="verse">and binding Him they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the Governor.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.3" type="verse">Then when Judas,  who had betrayed Him, saw that He was condemned, smitten with remorse he brought back the thirty shekels to the High Priests and Elders</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.4" type="verse">and said, "I have sinned, in betraying to death one who is innocent." "What does that matter to us?" they replied; it is your business."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.5" type="verse">Flinging the shekels into the Sanctuary he left the place, and went and hanged himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.6" type="verse">When the High Priests had gathered up the money they said, "It is illegal to put it into the Treasury, because it is the price of blood."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.7" type="verse">So after consulting together they spent the money in the purchase of the Potter's Field as a burial place for people not belonging to the city;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.8" type="verse">for which reason that piece of ground received the name, which it still bears, of `the Field of Blood.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.9" type="verse">Then were fulfilled the words spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah, &amp;lt;"And I took the thirty shekels, the price of the prized one on whom Israelites had set a price,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.10" type="verse">and  gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.11" type="verse">Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Governor, and the latter put the question, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  "I am their King," He answered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.12" type="verse">When however the High Priests and the Elders kept bringing their charges against Him, He said not a word in reply.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.13" type="verse">"Do you not hear," asked Pilate, "what a mass of  evidence they are bringing against you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.14" type="verse">But He made no reply to a single accusation, so that the Governor was greatly astonished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.15" type="verse">"Now it was the Governor's custom at the Festival to release some one prisoner, whomsoever the populace desired;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.16" type="verse">and at this time they had a notorious prisoner called  Barabbas.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.17" type="verse">So when they were now assembled Pilate appealed to them. "Whom shall I release to you," he said,  "Barabbas, or Jesus the so-called Christ?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.18" type="verse">For he knew that it was from envious hatred that Jesus had been brought before him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.19" type="verse">While he was sitting on the tribunal a message came to him from his wife. "Have nothing to do with that innocent man," she said, "for during the night I have suffered terribly in a dream through him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.20" type="verse">The High Priests, however, and the Elders  urged the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to demand the death of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.21" type="verse">So when the Governor  a second time asked them, "Which of the two shall I release to you?" --they cried, "Barabbas!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.22" type="verse">"What then," said Pilate, "shall I do with Jesus, the so-called Christ?" With one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!" </seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.23" type="verse">"Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they kept on furiously shouting, "Let him be crucified!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.24" type="verse">So when he saw that he could gain nothing, but that on the contrary there was a riot threatening, he called for water and washed his hands in sight of them all, saying, "I am  not responsible for this murder: you must answer for it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.25" type="verse">"His blood," replied all the people, "be on us and on our children!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.26" type="verse">Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he ordered to be  scourged, and gave Him up to be crucified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.27" type="verse">Then the Governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and called together the whole  battalion  to make sport of Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.28" type="verse">Stripping off His garments, they put on Him a general's short  crimson cloak.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.29" type="verse">They twisted a wreath of thorny twigs and put it on His head, and they put a sceptre of cane in His right hand, and kneeling to Him they shouted in mockery,  "Long live the King of the Jews!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.30" type="verse">Then they spat upon Him, and taking the cane they repeatedly struck Him on the head with it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.31" type="verse">At last, having finished their sport, they took off the cloak, clothed Him again in His own garments, and led Him away for crucifixion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.32" type="verse">Going out they met a Cyrenaean named Simon; whom they compelled to carry His cross,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.33" type="verse">and so they came to a place called Golgotha, which means `Skull-ground.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.34" type="verse">Here they gave Him a mixture of  wine and gall to drink, but having tasted it He refused to drink it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.35" type="verse">After crucifying Him, they divided His garments among them by lot,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.36" type="verse">and sat down there on guard.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.37" type="verse">Over His head they placed a written statement of the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.38" type="verse">At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him, one at His right hand and the other at His left.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.39" type="verse">And the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.40" type="verse">and said, "You who would pull down the Sanctuary and build a new one within three days, save yourself. If you are God's Son, come down from the cross."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.41" type="verse">In like manner the High Priests also, together with the Scribes and the Elders, taunted Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.42" type="verse">"He saved others," they said,  "himself he cannot save! He is the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.43" type="verse">His trust is in God: let God deliver him now, if He will have him; for he said, `I am God's Son.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.44" type="verse">Insults of the same kind were heaped on Him even by the  robbers who were being crucified with Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.27.46" type="verse">but about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, &amp;lt;"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"&amp;gt; that is to say, &amp;lt;"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.47" type="verse">"The man is calling for Elijah," said some of the bystanders.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.48" type="verse">One of them ran forthwith, and filling a sponge with  sour wine put it on the end of a cane and offered it Him to drink;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.27.50" type="verse">But Jesus uttered another loud cry and then yielded up His spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.51" type="verse">Immediately the curtain of the Sanctuary  was torn in two  from top to bottom: the earth quaked; the rocks split;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.52" type="verse">the tombs opened; and many of God's people who were asleep in death  awoke.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.53" type="verse">And coming out of their tombs after Christ's resurrection they entered the holy city and showed themselves to many.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.54" type="verse">As for the Captain and the soldiers who were with Him keeping guard over Jesus, when they witnessed the earthquake and the other occurrences they were filled with terror, and exclaimed, "Assuredly he was God's Son."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.55" type="verse">And there were a number of women there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to His necessities;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.27.57" type="verse">Towards sunset there came a wealthy inhabitant of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself also had become a disciple of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.58" type="verse">He went to Pilate and begged to have the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.59" type="verse">So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet of fine linen.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.60" type="verse">He then laid it in his own  new tomb which he had hewn in the solid rock, and after rolling a great stone against the door of the tomb he went home.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.61" type="verse">Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were both present there, sitting opposite to the sepulchre.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.62" type="verse">On the next day, the day after the Preparation, the High Priests and the Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.63" type="verse">"Sir," they said, "we recollect that during his lifetime that impostor pretended that after two days he was to rise to life again.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.64" type="verse">So give orders for the sepulchre to be securely guarded till the third day, for fear his disciples should come by night and steal  the body, and then tell the people that he has come back to life; and so the last imposture will be more serious than the first."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.27.65" type="verse">"You can have a guard," said Pilate: "go and make all safe, as best you can."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAT.28.12" type="verse">So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.13" type="verse">telling them to say, "His disciples came during the night and stole  his body while we were asleep."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.14" type="verse">"And if this," they added,  "is reported to the Governor, we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.15" type="verse">So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current to this day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.16" type="verse">As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee, to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.17" type="verse">There they saw Him and  prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.18" type="verse">Jesus however came near and said to them, "All  power in Heaven and  over the earth has been given to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.19" type="verse">Go  therefore and make disciples of all the nations; baptize them  into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAT.28.20" type="verse">and teach them to obey every command which I have given you. And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the  Close of the  Age."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.1.1" type="verse">The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ  the Son of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.2" type="verse">As  it is written in Isaiah the Prophet, &amp;lt;"See, I am sending My messenger before Thee, Who will prepare Thy way";</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.3" type="verse">"The voice of one  crying aloud: `In the Desert prepare a road for the Lord: Make His highways straight.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.4" type="verse">So John  the Baptizer came, and was in the Desert proclaiming a baptism of  the penitent for forgiveness of sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.5" type="verse">There went out to him people  of all classes from Judaea, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem of all ranks, and  were baptized by him  in the river Jordan, making open confession of their sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.6" type="verse">As for John, his garment was of camel's hair, and he wore a loincloth of leather; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.7" type="verse">His announcement was, "There is One coming after me mightier than I--One whose sandal-strap I am unworthy to stoop down and unfasten.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.8" type="verse">I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you  with the Holy Spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.9" type="verse">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.10" type="verse">and  immediately on His coming up out of the water He saw an opening in the sky, and the Spirit like a  dove coming down  to Him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.11" type="verse">and a voice came from the sky, saying, "Thou art My Son dearly loved: in Thee is My delight."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.12" type="verse">At once the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the Desert,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.13" type="verse">where He remained for forty days, tempted by Satan; and He was among the wild beasts, but the angels waited upon Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.14" type="verse">Then, after John had been  thrown into prison, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming God's Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.15" type="verse">"The time has fully come," He said, "and the Kingdom of God is close at hand: repent, and believe this Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.16" type="verse">One day, passing along the shore of the Lake of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, throwing their nets in the Lake; for they were fisherman.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.17" type="verse">"Come and follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers for men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.18" type="verse">At once they left their nets and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.19" type="verse">Going on a little further He saw James the son of Zabdi and his brother John: they also were in the boat mending the nets, and He immediately called them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.20" type="verse">They  therefore left their father Zabdi in the boat with the hired men, and went and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.21" type="verse">So they came to Capernaum, and on the next Sabbath He went to the synagogue and began to teach.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.22" type="verse">The people listened with amazement to His teaching--for there was authority about it: it was very different from that of the Scribes--</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.23" type="verse">when all at once, there in their synagogue, a man  under the power of a foul spirit screamed out:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.24" type="verse">"What have you to do with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--God's Holy One."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.25" type="verse">But Jesus reprimanded him, saying, "Silence! come out of him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.26" type="verse">So the foul spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions, came out of him with a loud cry.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.27" type="verse">And all were  amazed and awe-struck, so they began to ask one another, "What does this mean? Here is a new sort of teaching--and a tone of authority! And even to foul spirits he issues orders and they obey him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.28" type="verse">And His fame spread at once everywhere in all that part of Galilee.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.29" type="verse">Then on leaving the synagogue  they came at once, with James and John, to the house of Simon and Andrew.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.30" type="verse">Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill in bed with a fever, and without delay they informed Him about her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.31" type="verse">So He went to her, and taking her  hand He raised her to her feet: the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.32" type="verse">When it was evening, after sunset people came bringing Him all who were sick and the demoniacs;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.33" type="verse">and the whole town was assembled at the door.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.34" type="verse">Then He cured numbers of people who were ill with various diseases, and He drove out many demons; not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew  who He was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.35" type="verse">In the morning He rose early, while it was still quite dark, and leaving the house He went away to a solitary place and there prayed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.36" type="verse">And Simon and the others searched everywhere for Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.37" type="verse">When they found Him they said, "Every one is looking for you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.38" type="verse">"Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns," He replied, "that I may proclaim my Message there also; because for that purpose I came from God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.39" type="verse">And He went through all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and expelling the demons.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.40" type="verse">One day there came a leper to Jesus entreating Him, and pleading on his knees. "If you are willing," he said, "you are able to cleanse me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.41" type="verse">Moved with pity Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. "I am willing," He said; "be cleansed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.42" type="verse">The leprosy at once  left him, and he was cleansed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.43" type="verse">Jesus at once sent him away, strictly charging him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.44" type="verse">and saying, "Be careful not to tell any one, but go and show yourself to the Priest, and for your purification present the offerings that Moses appointed as evidence for them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.1.45" type="verse">But the man, when he went out, began to tell every one and to publish the matter abroad, so that it was no longer possible for Jesus to go openly into  any town; but He had to remain outside in unfrequented places, where people came to Him from all parts.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAR.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.1" type="verse">After some days He entered Capernaum again, and it soon became known that He was at home;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.2" type="verse">and such numbers of people came together that there was no longer room for them even round the door. He was speaking His Message to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.3" type="verse">when there came a party of people bringing a paralytic--four men carrying him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.4" type="verse">Finding themselves unable, however, to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they untiled the roof just over His head, and after clearing an opening they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.5" type="verse">Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are pardoned."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.6" type="verse">Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.7" type="verse">"Why does this man use such words?" they said; "he is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One--that is, God?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.8" type="verse">At once perceiving by His spirit that they were reasoning within themselves, Jesus asked them, "Why do you thus argue in your  minds?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.9" type="verse">Which is easier?--to say to this paralytic, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, `Rise, take up your mat, and walk?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.10" type="verse">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins" --He turned to the paralytic, and said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.11" type="verse">"To you I say, `Rise, take up your mat and go home.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.12" type="verse">The man rose, and immediately under the eyes of all took up his mat and went out, so that they were all filled with astonishment, gave the glory to God, and said, "We never saw anything like this."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.13" type="verse">Again He went out to the shore of the Lake, and the whole multitude kept coming to Him, and He taught them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.14" type="verse">And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting  at the Toll Office, and said to him, "Follow me." So he rose and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.15" type="verse">When He was  sitting at table in Levi's house, a large number of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners were at table with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many such who habitually followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.16" type="verse">But when the Scribes of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with the sinners and the tax-gatherers, they said to His disciples, "He is eating  and drinking with the tax-gatherers and sinners!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.17" type="verse">Jesus heard the words, and He said, "It is not the healthy who require a doctor, but the sick: I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.18" type="verse">(Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were  keeping a fast.) And they came and asked Him, "How is it that John's disciples and those of the Pharisees are fasting, and yours are not?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.19" type="verse">"Can a wedding party fast while the bridegroom is among them?" replied Jesus. "So long as they have the bridegroom with them, fasting is impossible.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.20" type="verse">But a time will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.21" type="verse">No one mends an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away from it--the new from the old--and a worse hole would be made.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.22" type="verse">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine needs fresh skins!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.23" type="verse">One Sabbath He was walking through the wheatfields when His disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat as they went.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.24" type="verse">So the Pharisees said to Him, "Look! why are they doing what on the Sabbath is unlawful?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.25" type="verse">"Have you never read," Jesus replied, "what David did when the necessity arose and he and his men were hungry:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.26" type="verse">how he entered the house of God  in the High-priesthood of Abiathar, and ate the Presented Loaves--which none but the priests are allowed to eat--and gave some to his men also?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.27" type="verse">And Jesus said to them: "The Sabbath was made for  man, not man for the Sabbath;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.2.28" type="verse">so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</seg>

        <div id="b.MAR.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.1" type="verse">At another time, when He went to the synagogue, there was a man there with one arm shrivelled up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.2" type="verse">They closely watched Him to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath--so as to have a charge to bring against Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.3" type="verse">"Come forward," said He to the man with the shrivelled arm.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.4" type="verse">Then He asked them, "Are we allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? to save a  life, or to destroy one?" They remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.5" type="verse">Grieved and indignant at the hardening of their hearts, He looked round on them with anger, and said to the man, "Stretch out your arm." He stretched it out, and the arm was completely restored.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.6" type="verse">But no sooner had the Pharisees left the synagogue than they held a consultation with the Herodians against Jesus, to devise some means of destroying Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.7" type="verse">Accordingly Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the Lake, and a vast crowd of people from Galilee followed Him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.8" type="verse">and from Judaea and Jerusalem and Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the district of Tyre and Sidon there came to Him a vast crowd, hearing of all that He was doing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.9" type="verse">So He gave directions to His disciples to keep a small boat in constant attendance on Him because of the throng--to prevent their crushing Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.10" type="verse">For He had cured many of the people, so that all who had any ailments pressed upon Him, to touch Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.11" type="verse">And the foul spirits, whenever they saw Him, threw themselves down at His feet, screaming out: "You are the Son of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.12" type="verse">But He many a time checked them, forbidding them to say who He was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.13" type="verse">Then He went up the hill; and those whom He Himself chose He called, and they came to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.14" type="verse">He appointed  twelve of them, that they might be with Him, and that He might also send them to proclaim His Message,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.15" type="verse">with authority to expel the demons.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.16" type="verse">These twelve were Simon (to whom He gave the surname of Peter),</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.17" type="verse">James the son of Zabdi and John the brother of James (these two He surnamed Boanerges, that is `Sons of Thunder'),</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.18" type="verse">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the  Cananaean,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.19" type="verse">and Judas Iscariot, the man who also betrayed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.20" type="verse">And He  went into a house. But again the crowd assembled, so that there was no opportunity for them even  to snatch a meal.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.21" type="verse">Hearing of this,  His relatives came to seize Him by force, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.22" type="verse">The Scribes, too, who had come down from Jerusalem said, "He has  Baal-zebul in him; and it is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he expels the demons."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.23" type="verse">So He called them to Him, and using figurative language He appealed to them, saying, "How is it possible for Satan to expel Satan?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.24" type="verse">For if civil war breaks out in a kingdom, nothing can make that kingdom last;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.25" type="verse">and if a family splits into parties, that family cannot continue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.26" type="verse">So if Satan has risen in arms and has made war upon himself, stand he cannot, but meets his end.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.27" type="verse">Nay, no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.28" type="verse">In solemn truth I tell you that all their sins may be pardoned to the sons of men, and all their blasphemies, however they may have blasphemed;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.29" type="verse">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he remains  for ever unabsolved: he is guilty of  a sin  of the Ages."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.30" type="verse">This was because they said, "He is possessed by a foul spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.31" type="verse">By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing  outside they send a message to Him to call Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.32" type="verse">Now a crowd was  sitting round Him; so they tell Him, "Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, inquiring for you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.33" type="verse">"Who are my mother and my brothers?" He replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.34" type="verse">And, fixing His eyes on the people who were sitting round Him in a circle, He said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.3.35" type="verse">"Here are my mother and my brothers. For wherever there is one who has been obedient to God, there is my brother--my sister--and my mother."</seg>

        <div id="b.MAR.4" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.1" type="verse">Once more He began to teach by the side of the Lake, and a vast multitude of people came together to listen to Him. He therefore went  on board the boat and sat there, a little way from the land; and all the people were on the shore close to the water.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.2" type="verse">Then He proceeded to teach them many lessons in figurative language; and in His teaching He said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.3" type="verse">"Listen: the sower  goes out to sow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.4" type="verse">As he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and the birds come and peck it up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.5" type="verse">Some falls on the rocky ground where it finds but little earth, and it shoots up quickly because it has no depth of soil;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.6" type="verse">but when the sun is risen, it is scorched, and through having no root it withers away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.7" type="verse">Some, again, falls among the thorns; and the thorns spring up and stifle it, so that it yields no crop.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.8" type="verse">But some of the seed falls into good ground, and gives a return: it comes up and increases, and yields thirty, sixty, or a hundred-fold."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.9" type="verse">"Listen," He added, "every one who has ears to listen with!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.10" type="verse">When He was alone, the Twelve and the others who were about Him requested Him to explain His figurative language.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.11" type="verse">"To you," He replied, "has been entrusted  the secret truth concerning the Kingdom of God; but to those others outside your number all this is spoken in figurative language;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.12" type="verse">that &amp;lt;"`They may look and look but not see, and listen and listen but not understand, lest perchance they should return and be pardoned.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.13" type="verse">"Do you all miss the meaning of this parable?" He added; "how then will you understand the rest of my parables?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.14" type="verse">"What the sower sows is the Message.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.15" type="verse">Those who receive the seed by the way-side are those in whom the Message is sown, but, when they have heard it, Satan comes at once and carries away the Message sown in them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.16" type="verse">In the same way those who  receive the seed on the rocky places are those who, when they have heard the Message, at once accept it joyfully,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.17" type="verse">but they have no root within them. They last for a time; then, when suffering or persecution comes because of the Message, they  are immediately overthrown.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.18" type="verse">Others there are who  receive the seed among the thorns: these are they who have heard the Message,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.19" type="verse">but worldly cares and the deceitfulness of wealth and the excessive pursuit of other objects come in and stifle the Message, and it becomes unfruitful.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.20" type="verse">Those, on the other hand, who  have received the seed on the good ground, are all who hear the Message and welcome it, and yield a return of thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.21" type="verse">He went on to say, "Is the lamp brought in in order to be put under the  bushel or under the bed? Is it not rather in order that it may be placed on the lampstand?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.22" type="verse">Why, there is nothing hidden except with a view to its being ultimately disclosed, nor has anything been made a secret but that it may at last come to light.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.23" type="verse">Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.24" type="verse">He also said to them, "Take care what you hear. With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and that with interest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.25" type="verse">For those who have will have more given them; and from those who have not, even what they have will be taken away."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.26" type="verse">Another saying of His was this: "The Kingdom of God is as if a man scattered seed over the ground:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.27" type="verse">he spends days and nights, now awake, now asleep, while the seed sprouts and grows tall, he knows not how.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.28" type="verse">Of itself the land produces the crop--  first the blade, then the ear; afterwards the perfect grain is seen in the ear.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.29" type="verse">But no sooner is the crop ripe, than he sends the  reapers, because the time of harvest has come."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.30" type="verse">Another saying of His was this: "How are we to picture the Kingdom of God? or by what figure of speech shall we represent it?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.31" type="verse">It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the earth, is the smallest of all the seeds in the world;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.32" type="verse">yet when sown it springs up and becomes larger than all the  herbs, and throws out great branches, so that the birds build under its shadow."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.33" type="verse">With many such parables He used to speak the Message to them according to their capacity for receiving it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.34" type="verse">But except in figurative language He spoke nothing to them; while to His own disciples He expounded everything, in private.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.35" type="verse">The same day, in the evening, He said to them, "Let us cross to the other side."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.36" type="verse">So they got away from the crowd, and took Him--as He was--in the boat; and other boats accompanied Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.37" type="verse">But a heavy squall came on, and the waves were now dashing into the boat, so that it was fast filling.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.38" type="verse">But He Himself was in the stern asleep, with His head on the cushion: so they woke Him.  "Rabbi," they cried, "is it nothing to you that we are drowning?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.39" type="verse">So He roused Himself and rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!" The wind sank, and a perfect calm set in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.40" type="verse">"Why are you so timid?" He asked; "have you still no faith?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.4.41" type="verse">Then they were filled with terror, and began to say to one another, "Who is this, then? For even wind and sea obey Him."</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAR.5" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.1" type="verse">So they arrived at the opposite shore of the Lake, in the country of the Gerasenes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.2" type="verse">At once, on His landing, there came from the tombs to meet Him a man  possessed by a foul spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.3" type="verse">This man lived  among the tombs, nor could any one now secure him even with a chain;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.4" type="verse">for many a time he had been left securely bound in fetters and chains, but afterwards the chains lay torn link from link, and the fetters in fragments, and there was no one strong enough to master him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.5" type="verse">And constantly, day and night, he remained among the tombs or on the hills, shrieking, and mangling himself with sharp stones.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.6" type="verse">And when he saw Jesus in the distance, he ran and threw himself at His feet,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.7" type="verse">crying out in a loud voice, "What hast Thou to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? In God's name I implore Thee not to torment me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.8" type="verse">For He  had said to him, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.9" type="verse">Jesus also questioned him. "What is your name?" He said. "Legion," he replied, "for there are a host of us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.10" type="verse">And  he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out of the country.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.11" type="verse">Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.12" type="verse">So they besought Jesus. "Send us to the swine," they said, "so that we may enter into them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.13" type="verse">He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered into the swine, and the herd--about 2,000 in number--rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned in the Lake.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.14" type="verse">The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country. So the people came to see what it was that had happened;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.15" type="verse">and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated, clothed and of sane mind--the man who had had the legion; and they were awe-stricken.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.16" type="verse">And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.17" type="verse">Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.18" type="verse">As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked permission to accompany Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.19" type="verse">But He would not allow it. "Go home to your family," He said, "and report to them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.20" type="verse">So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.21" type="verse">When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.22" type="verse">when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue--he was called  Jair--who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.23" type="verse">and besought Him with many entreaties. "My little daughter," he said, "is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands upon her, that she may recover and live."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.24" type="verse">And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.25" type="verse">Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.26" type="verse">and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.27" type="verse">heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.28" type="verse">for she said, "If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.29" type="verse">In a moment the  flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself that her complaint was cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.30" type="verse">Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone  from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.31" type="verse">"You see the multitude pressing you on all sides," His disciples exclaimed, "and yet you ask, `Who touched me?'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.32" type="verse">But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.33" type="verse">until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet, and told Him all the truth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.34" type="verse">"Daughter," He said, "your faith has cured you: go in peace, and be free from your complaint."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.35" type="verse">While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, "Your daughter  is dead: why trouble the  Rabbi further?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.36" type="verse">But Jesus,  overhearing the words, said to the Warden, "Do not be afraid; only have faith."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.37" type="verse">And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and the brothers James and John.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.38" type="verse">So they come to the Warden's house. Here He gazes on a scene of uproar, with people  weeping aloud and wailing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.39" type="verse">He goes in. "Why all this outcry and loud weeping?" He asks; "the child is asleep, not dead."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.40" type="verse">To this their reply is a scornful laugh. He, however, puts them all out, takes the child's father and mother and those He has brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.41" type="verse">Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, "Talitha, koum;" that is to say, "Little girl, I command you to wake!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.42" type="verse">Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk (for she was twelve years old). They were  at once beside themselves with utter astonishment;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.5.43" type="verse">but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAR.6" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.1" type="verse">Leaving that place He came into His  own country, accompanied by His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.2" type="verse">On the Sabbath He proceeded to teach in the synagogue; and many, as they heard Him, were astonished. "Where did he acquire all this?" they asked. "What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And what are  these marvellous miracles which his hands perform?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.3" type="verse">Is not this the carpenter, Mary's son, the brother of James and Joses, Jude and Simon? And do not his sisters live here among us?" So they turned angrily away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.4" type="verse">But Jesus said to them, "There is no Prophet without honour except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own home."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.5" type="verse">And He could not do any miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few who were out of health and cured them; and</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.6" type="verse">He wondered at their unbelief.  So He went round the adjacent villages, teaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.7" type="verse">Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.8" type="verse">He charged them to take nothing  for the journey except a stick; no bread, no bag, and  not a penny in their  pockets,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.9" type="verse">but to go wearing  sandals. "And do not," He said, "put on an extra under garment.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.10" type="verse">Wherever you enter a house, make it your home till you leave that place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.11" type="verse">But wherever they will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the very dust from under your feet to bear witness concerning them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.12" type="verse">So they set out, and preached in order that men might repent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.13" type="verse">Many demons they expelled, and many invalids they anointed with oil and cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.14" type="verse">King Herod heard of all this (for the name of Jesus had become widely known), and  he kept saying, "John  the Baptizer  has come back to life, and that is why  these miraculous Powers are working in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.15" type="verse">Others asserted that He was Elijah. Others again said, "He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.16" type="verse">But when Herod heard of Him, he said, "The John, whom I beheaded,  has come back to life."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.17" type="verse">For  Herod himself had sent and had had John arrested and had kept him in prison in chains, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.18" type="verse">For John had repeatedly told Herod, "You have no right to be living with your brother's wife."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.19" type="verse">Therefore Herodias  hated him and wished to take his life, but could not;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.20" type="verse">for Herod  stood in awe of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and he protected him. After listening to him he  was in great perplexity, and yet he found a pleasure in listening.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.21" type="verse">At length Herodias found her opportunity. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to the nobles of his court and to the  tribunes and the principal people in Galilee,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.22" type="verse">at which  Herodias's own daughter came in and danced, and so charmed Herod and his guests that he said to her, "Ask me for anything you please, and I will give it to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.23" type="verse">He even swore to her, "Whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.24" type="verse">She at once went out and said to her mother: "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptizer," she replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.25" type="verse">The girl immediately came in, in haste, to the King and made her request. "My desire is," she said, "that you will give me, here and now, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.26" type="verse">Then the King, though intensely sorry, yet for the sake of his oaths, and of his guests, would not break faith with her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.27" type="verse">He at once sent a soldier of his guard with orders to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.28" type="verse">and brought his head on a dish and gave it to the young girl, who gave it to her mother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.29" type="verse">When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.30" type="verse">When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported to Him all they had done and all they had taught.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.31" type="verse">Then He said to them, "Come away, all of you, to a quiet place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, so that they had no time even for meals.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.32" type="verse">Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.33" type="verse">But the people saw them going, and many knew them; and coming by land they ran together there from all the neighbouring towns, and arrived before them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.34" type="verse">So when Jesus landed, He saw a vast multitude; and His heart was moved with pity for them, because they were like sheep which have no shepherd, and He proceeded to teach them many things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.35" type="verse">By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said, "This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.36" type="verse">send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near here and buy themselves something to eat."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.37" type="verse">"Give them food yourselves," He replied. "Are we," they asked, "to go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread and give them food?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.38" type="verse">"How many loaves have you?" He inquired; "go and see." So they found out, and said, "Five; and a couple of fish."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.39" type="verse">So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on the green grass.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.40" type="verse">And they sat down in  rows of hundreds and of fifties.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.41" type="verse">Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and lifting His eyes to Heaven He blessed the food. Then He broke the loaves into portions which He went on handing to the disciples to distribute; giving pieces also of the two fish to them all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.42" type="verse">All ate and were fully satisfied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.43" type="verse">And they carried away broken portions enough to fill twelve baskets, besides pieces of the fish.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.44" type="verse">Those who ate the bread were 5,000 adult men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.45" type="verse">Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board the boat and cross over to Bethsaida, leaving Him behind to dismiss the crowd.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.46" type="verse">He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.47" type="verse">When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake, while he Himself was on shore alone.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.48" type="verse">But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them),  towards morning He came towards them walking on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.49" type="verse">They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.50" type="verse">for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. "There is no danger," He said; "it is I; be not alarmed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.51" type="verse">Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside themselves with  silent amazement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.52" type="verse">For they had not  learned the lesson taught by the loaves, but their  minds were dull.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.53" type="verse">Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and came  to anchor.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.54" type="verse">But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people immediately recognized Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.55" type="verse">Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.6.56" type="verse">And enter wherever He might--village or town or hamlet--they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe; and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAR.7" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.1" type="verse">Then  the Pharisees, with certain Scribes who had come from Jerusalem, came to Him in a body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.2" type="verse">They had noticed that some of His disciples were eating their food with `unclean' (that is to say, unwashed) hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.3" type="verse">(For the Pharisees and all the Jews--being, as they are, zealous for the traditions of the Elders--never eat without first  carefully washing their hands,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.4" type="verse">and when they come from market they will not eat without  bathing first; and they have a good many other customs which they have received traditionally and cling to, such as the rinsing of cups and pots and of bronze utensils,  and the washing of beds.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.5" type="verse">So the Pharisees and Scribes put the question to Him: "Why do your disciples transgress the traditions of the Elders, and eat their  food with unclean hands?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.6" type="verse">"Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites," He replied; "as it is written, &amp;lt;"`This People honour Me with their lips, while their hearts are far away from Me:</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.7" type="verse">But idle is their devotion while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.8" type="verse">"You neglect God's Commandment: you hold fast to men's traditions."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.9" type="verse">"Praiseworthy indeed!" He added, "to set at nought God's Commandment in order to observe your own traditions!</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.10" type="verse">For Moses said, &amp;lt;`Honour thy father and thy mother'&amp;gt; and again, &amp;lt;`He who  curses father or mother, let him  die the death.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.11" type="verse">But *you* say, `If a man says to his father or mother, It is a Korban (that is, a thing  devoted to God), whatever it is, which otherwise you would have received  from me--'</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.7.13" type="verse">thus nullifying God's precept by  your tradition which you have handed down. And many things of that kind you do."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.14" type="verse">Then Jesus called the people to Him again. "Listen to me, all of you," He said, "and understand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.15" type="verse">There is nothing  outside a man which entering him can make him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man that make him unclean."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.7.17" type="verse">After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples began to ask Him about this figure of speech.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.18" type="verse">"Have *you* also so little understanding?" He replied; "do you not understand that anything whatever that enters a man from outside cannot make him unclean,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.19" type="verse">because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and passes away ejected from him?" By these words Jesus pronounced all kinds of food clean.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.7.24" type="verse">Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood of Tyre  and Sidon. Here He entered a house and wished no one to know it, but He could not escape observation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.25" type="verse">Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself at His feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.26" type="verse">She was a  Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation: and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon from her daughter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.27" type="verse">"Let the children first eat all they want," He said; "it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the  dogs."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.28" type="verse">"True, Sir," she replied, "and yet the dogs under the table eat the children's scraps."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.29" type="verse">"For those words of yours, go home," He replied; "the demon has gone out of your daughter."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.30" type="verse">So she went home, and found the child  lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.31" type="verse">Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing through the district of the Ten Towns.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.32" type="verse">Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on whom they begged Him to lay His hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.33" type="verse">So Jesus taking him aside, apart from the crowd, put His fingers into his ears, and spat, and moistened his tongue;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.34" type="verse">and looking up to Heaven  He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" (that is, "Open!")</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.35" type="verse">And the man's ears were opened, and his tongue became untied, and he began to speak perfectly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.36" type="verse">Then Jesus charged them to tell no one; but the more He charged them, all the more did they spread the news far and wide.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.7.37" type="verse">The amazement was extreme.  "He succeeds in everything he attempts," they exclaimed; "he even makes deaf men hear and dumb men speak!"</seg>

        <div id="b.MAR.8" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.1" type="verse">About that time there was again an immense crowd, and they found themselves with nothing to eat. So He called His disciples to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.2" type="verse">"My heart yearns over the people," He said; "for this is now  the third day they have remained with me, and they have nothing to eat.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.3" type="verse">If I were to send them home hungry, they would faint on the way, some of them having come a great distance."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.4" type="verse">"Where can we possibly get bread here in this remote place to satisfy such a crowd?" answered His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.5" type="verse">"How many loaves have you?" He asked. "Seven," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.6" type="verse">So He passed the word to the people to sit down on the ground. Then taking the seven loaves He blessed them, and broke them into portions and proceeded to give them to His disciples for them to distribute, and they distributed them to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.7" type="verse">They had also a few small fish. He blessed them, and He told His disciples to distribute these also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.8" type="verse">So the people ate an abundant meal; and what remained over they picked up and carried away--seven hampers of broken pieces.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.9" type="verse">The number fed were about 4,000. Then He sent them away,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.10" type="verse">and at once going on board with His disciples He came into the district of Dalmanutha.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.11" type="verse">The Pharisees followed Him and began to dispute with Him, asking Him for a sign  in the sky, to make trial of Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.12" type="verse">Heaving a deep and troubled sigh, He said, "Why do the men of to-day ask for a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign will be given to the men of to-day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.13" type="verse">So He left them, went on board again, and came away to the other side.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.14" type="verse">Now they had forgotten to take bread, nor had they more than a single loaf with them in the boat;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.15" type="verse">and when He admonished them, "See to it, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.16" type="verse">they explained His words to one another by saying, "We have no bread!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.17" type="verse">He perceived what they were saying, and He said to them, "What is this discussion of yours about having no bread? Do you not yet see and understand? Are your minds so dull of comprehension?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.18" type="verse">&amp;lt;You have eyes! can you not see? You have ears! can you not hear?&amp;gt; and  have you no memory?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.19" type="verse">When I broke up the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets did you carry away full of broken portions?" "Twelve," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.20" type="verse">"And when the seven for the 4,000, how many hampers full of portions did you take away?" "Seven," they answered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.21" type="verse">"Do you not yet understand?"  He said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.22" type="verse">And they came to Bethsaida. And a blind man was brought to Jesus and they entreated Him to touch him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.23" type="verse">So He took the blind man by the  arm and brought him out of the village, and spitting into his eyes He put His hands on him and asked him, "Can you see anything?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.24" type="verse">He looked up and said, "I can see the people: I see them like trees--only walking."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.25" type="verse">Then for the second time He put His hands on the man's eyes, and the man, looking steadily, recovered his sight and saw everything distinctly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.26" type="verse">So He sent him home, and added, "Do not even go into the village."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.27" type="verse">From that place Jesus and His disciples went to the villages belonging to Caesarea Philippi. On the way He  began to ask His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.28" type="verse">"John the Baptist," they replied, "but others say Elijah, and others, that it is one of the Prophets."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.29" type="verse">Then  He asked them pointedly, "But you yourselves, who do you say that I am?" "You are  the Christ," answered Peter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.30" type="verse">And He strictly forbad them to tell this about Him to any one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.31" type="verse">And now for the first time He told them, "The Son of Man  must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and after two days  rise to life."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.32" type="verse">This He told them plainly; whereupon Peter took Him and began to remonstrate with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.33" type="verse">But turning round and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter. "Get behind me,  Adversary," He said, "for your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but men's."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.34" type="verse">Then calling to Him the crowd and also His disciples, He said to them, "If any one is desirous of following me, let him ignore self and take up his cross, and so be my follower.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.35" type="verse">For whoever is bent on securing his  life will lose it, but he who loses his  life for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, will secure it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.36" type="verse">Why, what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world and  forfeit his life?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.37" type="verse">For what could a man give to buy back his life?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.8.38" type="verse">Every one, however, who  has been ashamed of me and of my teachings in this  faithless and sinful age, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in His Father's glory with the holy angels."</seg>

        <div id="b.MAR.9" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.1" type="verse">He went on to say, "In solemn truth I tell you that some of those who  are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God  already come  in power."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.2" type="verse">Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and brought them alone, apart from the rest, up a high mountain; and in their presence His appearance underwent a change.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.3" type="verse">His garments also became dazzling with brilliant whiteness--such whiteness as no bleaching on earth could give.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.4" type="verse">Moreover there appeared to them Elijah accompanied by Moses; and the two were conversing with Jesus,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.5" type="verse">when  Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi,  we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three  tents--one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.6" type="verse">For he knew not what  to say: they were filled with such awe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.7" type="verse">Then there came a cloud  spreading over them, and a voice issued from the cloud, "This is my Son, dearly loved: listen to Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.8" type="verse">Instantly they looked round, and now they could no longer see any one, but themselves and Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.9" type="verse">As they were coming down from the mountain, He very strictly forbad them to tell any one what they had seen "until after the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.10" type="verse">So they kept the matter to themselves, although frequently asking one another what was meant by the rising from the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.11" type="verse">They also asked Him, "How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.12" type="verse">"Elijah," He replied, "does indeed come first and reforms everything; but how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He will endure much suffering and be held in contempt?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.13" type="verse">Yet I tell you that not only has Elijah come, but they have also done to him whatever they chose, as the Scriptures say about him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.14" type="verse">As they came to rejoin the disciples, they saw an immense crowd surrounding them and a party of Scribes disputing with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.15" type="verse">Immediately the whole multitude on beholding Him were  astonished and awe-struck, and yet they ran forward and  greeted Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.16" type="verse">"What is the subject you are discussing?" He asked them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.17" type="verse">"Rabbi," answered one of the crowd,  "I have brought you my son. He has a dumb spirit in him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.18" type="verse">and wherever it comes upon him, it  dashes him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I  begged your disciples to expel it, but they had not the power."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.19" type="verse">"O unbelieving generation!" replied Jesus; "how long must I be with you? how long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.20" type="verse">So they brought him to Jesus. And the spirit,  when he saw Jesus, immediately threw the youth into convulsions, so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.21" type="verse">Then Jesus asked the father, "How long has he been like this?" "From early childhood," he said;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.22" type="verse">"and often it has thrown him into the fire  or into  pools of water to destroy him. But, if you possibly can, have pity on us and help us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.23" type="verse">"`If I possibly can!'" replied Jesus; "why, everything is possible to him who believes."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.24" type="verse">Immediately the father  cried out, "I do believe: strengthen my weak faith."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.25" type="verse">Then Jesus, seeing that an increasing crowd was running towards Him, rebuked the foul spirit, and said to it, "Dumb and deaf spirit, *I* command you, come out of him and never enter into him again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.26" type="verse">So with a loud cry he threw the boy into fit after fit, and came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, so that most of them said  he was dead;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.27" type="verse">but Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he stood on his feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.28" type="verse">After the return of Jesus  to the house His disciples asked Him privately, "How is it that we could not expel the spirit?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.29" type="verse">"An evil spirit of this kind," He answered, "can only be driven out  by prayer."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.30" type="verse">Departing thence they passed through Galilee, and He was unwilling that any one should know it;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.31" type="verse">for He was teaching His disciples, and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and after being put to death, in three days He will rise to life again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.32" type="verse">They, however, did not understand what He meant, and were afraid to question Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.33" type="verse">So they came to Capernaum; and when in the house He asked them, "What were you arguing about on the way?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.34" type="verse">But they remained silent; for on the way they had debated with one another who was the chief of them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.35" type="verse">Then sitting down He called the Twelve, and said to them, "If any one wishes to be first,  he must be last of all and servant of all."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.36" type="verse">And taking a young child He made him stand in their midst, then threw His arms round him and said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.37" type="verse">"Whoever  for my sake receives one such young child as this, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not so much me as Him who sent me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.38" type="verse">"Rabbi,"  said John to Him, "we saw a  man making use of your name to expel demons, and we tried to hinder him,  on the ground that he did not follow us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.39" type="verse">"You should not have tried to hinder him," replied Jesus, "for there is no one who will use my name to perform a miracle and be able the next minute to speak evil of me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.9.40" type="verse">He who is not against us is for us;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.10.33" type="verse">"See," He said, "we are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and the Scribes. They will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over to the Gentiles;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.34" type="verse">they will insult Him in cruel sport, spit on Him,  scourge Him, and put Him to death; but on the third day He will rise to life again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.35" type="verse">Then James and John, the sons of Zabdi, came up to Him and said,  "Rabbi, we wish you would grant us  whatever request we make of you."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.10.39" type="verse">"We are able," they replied. "Out of the cup," said Jesus, "from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.40" type="verse">but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not mine to give: it will be for those for whom it is reserved."</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.10.42" type="verse">Jesus, however, called them to Him and said to them, "You are aware how those who are deemed rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men make them feel their authority;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.10.47" type="verse">Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, "Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.48" type="verse">Many angrily told him to leave off shouting; but he only cried out all the louder, "Son of David, have pity on me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.49" type="verse">Then Jesus stood still. "Call him," He said. So they called the blind man. "Cheer up," they said; "rise, he is calling you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.50" type="verse">The man flung away his outer garment, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.51" type="verse">"What shall I do for you?"  said Jesus.  "Rabboni," replied the blind man, "let me  recover my sight."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.10.52" type="verse">"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has cured you." Instantly he  regained his sight, and followed Him along the road.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.11.1" type="verse">When they were getting near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on in front, with these instructions.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.11.8" type="verse">Then many spread their outer garments to carpet the road, and others leafy branches which they had cut down  in the fields;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.11.18" type="verse">This the High Priests and Scribes heard, and they began to devise means to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, because of the deep impression produced on all the people by His teaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.11.19" type="verse">When evening came on, Jesus and His disciples used to leave the city.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.11.27" type="verse">They came again to Jerusalem; and as He was walking in the Temple, the High Priests, Scribes and Elders came to Him</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.12.1" type="verse">Then He began to speak to them in figurative language. "There was once a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard, fenced it round, dug a pit for the wine-tank, and built a strong lodge. Then he let the place to vine-dressers and went abroad.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.2" type="verse">At vintage-time he sent one of his servants to receive from the vine-dressers a share of the grapes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.3" type="verse">But they seized him, beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.4" type="verse">Again he sent to them another servant: and as for him, they  wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.5" type="verse">Yet a third he sent, and him they killed. And he sent many besides, and them also they ill-treated, beating some and killing others.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.6" type="verse">He had still one left whom he could send, a dearly-loved son: him last of all he sent, saying, "`They will treat my son with respect.'</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.12.12" type="verse">And they kept looking out for an opportunity to seize Him, but were afraid of the people; for they saw that in this parable He had referred to *them*. So they left Him and went away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.13" type="verse">Their next step was to send to Him some of the Pharisees and of Herod's partisans to entrap Him in conversation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.14" type="verse">So they came to Him.  "Rabbi," they said, "we know that you are a truthful man and you do not fear any one; for you do not recognize human distinctions, but teach God's way truly. Is it allowable to pay poll-tax to Caesar, or not?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.15" type="verse">Shall we pay, or shall we refuse to pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, replied, "Why try to ensnare me? Bring me a shilling for me to look at."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.16" type="verse">They brought one; and He asked them, "Whose is this likeness and this inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.12.18" type="verse">Then came to Him a party of Sadducees, a sect which denies that there is any Resurrection; and they proceeded to question Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.19" type="verse">"Rabbi," they said, "Moses made it a law for us: &amp;lt;`If a man's brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.20" type="verse">There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife, but at his death left no family.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.12.22" type="verse">And so did the rest of the seven, all dying childless. Finally the woman also died.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.23" type="verse">At the Resurrection whose wife will she be? For they all seven married her."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.24" type="verse">"Is not this the cause of your error," replied Jesus--"your ignorance alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.25" type="verse">For when they have risen from among the dead, men do not marry and women are not given in marriage, but they are as angels are in Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.26" type="verse">But as to the dead, that they  rise to life, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God said to him, &amp;lt;`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.27" type="verse">He is not the God of dead, but of living men. You are in grave error."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.28" type="verse">Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point, and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, "Which is the chief of all the Commandments?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.29" type="verse">"The chief Commandment," replied Jesus, "is this: &amp;lt;`Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.30" type="verse">and thou shalt love the Lord thy God  with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.31" type="verse">"The second is this: &amp;lt;`Thou shalt love thy  fellow man as thou lovest thyself.'&amp;gt; "Other Commandment greater than these there is none."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.32" type="verse">So the Scribe said to Him, "Rightly, in very truth, Rabbi, have you said that &amp;lt;He stands alone, and there is none but He;&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.33" type="verse">and &amp;lt;To love Him with all one's heart, with all one's understanding, and with all one's strength, and to love one's fellow man no less than oneself,&amp;gt; is far better than all our &amp;lt;whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.34" type="verse">Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.35" type="verse">But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, "How is it the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.36" type="verse">David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, &amp;lt;"`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until  I have made thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.37" type="verse">"David himself calls Him `Lord:' how then can He be his son?" And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.38" type="verse">Moreover in the course of His teaching He said,  "Be on your guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.39" type="verse">and to occupy the best seats  in the synagogues and at dinner parties,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.40" type="verse">and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their wickedness by making long prayers: these men will receive far heavier punishment."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.41" type="verse">Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed how the people were dropping money into the Treasury, and that many of the wealthy threw in large sums.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.42" type="verse">But there came one poor widow and dropped in two farthings, equal in value to a halfpenny.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.12.43" type="verse">So He called His disciples to Him and said, "In solemn truth I tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more than all the other contributors to the Treasury;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.13.3" type="verse">He was sitting  on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple, when Peter, James, John, and Andrew, apart from the others asked Him,</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.14.1" type="verse">It was now  two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the High Priests and Scribes were bent on finding how to seize Him by stratagem and put Him to death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.2" type="verse">But they said, "Not on the Festival-day, for fear there should be a riot among the people."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.3" type="verse">Now when He was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while He was at table, there came a woman with a jar of  pure, sweet-scented ointment very costly: she broke the jar and poured the ointment over His head.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.4" type="verse">But there were some who said indignantly among themselves, "Why has the ointment been thus wasted?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.5" type="verse">For that ointment might have been sold for  fifteen pounds or more,  and the money have been given to the poor." And they were exceedingly angry with her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.6" type="verse">But Jesus said, "Leave her alone: why are you troubling her? She has done a most gracious act towards me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.7" type="verse">For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you choose you can do acts of kindness to them; but me you have not always.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.8" type="verse">What she could she did: she has perfumed my body in preparation for my burial.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.9" type="verse">And I solemnly tell you that wherever in the whole world the Good News shall be proclaimed, this which she has done shall also be told in remembrance of her."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.10" type="verse">But Judas Iscariot,  already mentioned as one of the Twelve, went to the High Priests to betray Jesus to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.11" type="verse">They gladly listened to his proposal, and promised to give him a sum of money. So he looked out for an opportunity to betray Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.12" type="verse">On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread--the day for killing the Passover lamb--His disciples asked Him, "Where shall we go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.13" type="verse">So He sent two of His disciples with instructions, saying, "Go into the city, and you will meet  a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.14" type="verse">and whatever house he enters, tell the master of the house, `The  Rabbi asks, Where is my  room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.15" type="verse">Then he will himself show you a large room upstairs, ready furnished: there make preparation for us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.16" type="verse">So the disciples went out and came to the city, and found everything just as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.17" type="verse">When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.18" type="verse">And while they were at table Jesus said, "I solemnly tell you that one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.19" type="verse">They were filled with sorrow, and began asking Him, one by one, "Not I, is it?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.20" type="verse">"It is one of the Twelve," He replied; "he who is dipping his fingers in the dish with me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.21" type="verse">For the Son of Man is going His way as it is written about Him; but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been a happy thing for that man, had he never been born."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.22" type="verse">Also during the meal He took a Passover biscuit, blessed it, and broke it. He then gave it to them, saying,  "Take this, it is my body."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.23" type="verse">Then He  took the cup, gave thanks, and handed it to them, and they all of them drank  from it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.24" type="verse">"This is my blood," He said, "which is to be poured out on behalf of many--the blood  which makes  the Covenant sure.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.25" type="verse">I solemnly tell you that never again will I taste the produce of the vine till I shall drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.26" type="verse">After singing  a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.27" type="verse">Then said Jesus to them, "All of you are about to stumble and fall, for it is written, &amp;lt;`I will strike down the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered in all directions.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.28" type="verse">But after I have risen to life again I will go before you into Galilee."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.29" type="verse">"All may stumble and fall," said Peter, "yet I never will."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.30" type="verse">"I solemnly tell you," replied Jesus, "that to-day--this night--before the cock crows twice, you yourself will three times disown me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.31" type="verse">"Even if I must die with you," declared Peter again and again, "I will never disown you." In like manner protested also all the disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.32" type="verse">So they came to a place called Gethsemane. There He said to His disciples, "Sit down here till I have prayed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.33" type="verse">Then He took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be full of terror and distress,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.34" type="verse">and He said to them, "My heart is oppressed with anguish to the very point of death: wait here and keep awake."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.35" type="verse">Going forward a short distance He threw Himself upon His face and prayed repeatedly that, if it was possible,  He might be spared that time of agony;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.36" type="verse">and He said, "Abba!  my Father! all things are possible for Thee:  take this  cup of suffering away from me: and yet not what I desire, but what Thou desirest."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.37" type="verse">Then He came and found them asleep, and He said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Had you not strength to keep awake a single hour?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.38" type="verse">Be wakeful, all of you, and keep on praying, that you may not come into temptation:  the spirit is right willing, but the body is frail."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.39" type="verse">He again went away and prayed, using the very same words.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.40" type="verse">When He returned He again found them asleep, for they were very tired; and they knew not how to answer Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.41" type="verse">A third time He came, and then He said, "Sleep on and rest. Enough! the hour has come. Even now they are betraying the Son of Man into the hands of sinful men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.42" type="verse">Rouse yourselves, let us be going: my betrayer is close at hand."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.43" type="verse">Immediately, while He was still speaking,  Judas, one of the Twelve, came and with him a crowd of men armed with swords and cudgels, sent by the High Priests and Scribes and Elders.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.44" type="verse">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss," he said, "is the man: lay hold of him, and take him safely away."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.45" type="verse">So he came, and going straight to Jesus he said, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him with seeming affection;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.46" type="verse">whereupon they laid hands on Him and held Him firmly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.47" type="verse">But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck a blow at the High Priest's  servant, cutting off his ear.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.48" type="verse">"Have you come out," said Jesus, "with swords and cudgels to arrest me, as if you had to fight with a robber?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.49" type="verse">Day after day I used to be among you in the Temple teaching, and you never seized me. But  this is happening in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.50" type="verse">Then His friends all forsook Him and fled.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.51" type="verse">One youth indeed did follow Him,  wearing only a  linen cloth round his bare body. Of him they laid hold,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.52" type="verse">but he left the linen cloth in their hands and fled  without it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.53" type="verse">So they led Jesus away to the High Priest, and  with him there assembled all the High Priests, Elders, and Scribes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.54" type="verse">Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the outer court of the High Priest's palace. But there he remained sitting among the  officers, and warming himself  by the fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.55" type="verse">Meanwhile the High Priests and the entire Sanhedrin were endeavouring to get evidence against Jesus in order to put Him to death, but could find none;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.56" type="verse">for though many gave false testimony against Him, their statements did not tally.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.57" type="verse">Then some came forward as witnesses and falsely declared,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.58" type="verse">"We have heard him say, `I will pull down this Sanctuary built by human hands, and three days afterwards I will erect another built without hands.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.59" type="verse">But not even in this shape was their testimony consistent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.60" type="verse">At last the High Priest stood up, and advancing into the midst of them all, asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is the meaning of all this that these witnesses allege against you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.61" type="verse">But He remained silent, and gave no reply. A second time the High Priest questioned Him. "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?" he said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.62" type="verse">"I am," replied Jesus, "and  you and others will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the  divine Power, and coming amid the clouds of the sky."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.63" type="verse">Rending his garments the High Priest exclaimed, "What need have we of witnesses after that?</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.64" type="verse">You all heard his impious words. What is your judgement?" Then with one voice they condemned Him as deserving of death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.65" type="verse">Thereupon some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, while striking Him with their fists and crying,  "Prove that you are a prophet." The  officers too  struck Him with  open hands as they took Him in charge.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.66" type="verse">Now while Peter was below in the quadrangle, one of the High Priest's maidservants came,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.67" type="verse">and seeing Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Nazarene."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.68" type="verse">But he denied it, and said,  "I don't know--I don't understand--What do you mean?" And then he went out into the outer court.  Just then a cock crowed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.69" type="verse">Again the maidservant saw him, and again began to say to the people standing by, "He is one of them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.70" type="verse">A second time he repeatedly denied it. Soon afterwards the bystanders again accused Peter, saying, "You are surely one of them, for you too are a Galilaean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.71" type="verse">But he broke out into curses and oaths, declaring, "I know nothing of the man you are talking about."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.14.72" type="verse">No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed for the second time, and Peter recollected the words of Jesus, "Before the cock crows twice, you will three times disown me." And as he thought of it, he  wept aloud.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.MAR.15" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.1" type="verse">At earliest dawn, after the High Priests had held a consultation with the Elders and Scribes, they and the entire Sanhedrin bound Jesus and took Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.2" type="verse">So Pilate questioned Him. "Are *you* the King of the Jews?" he asked. "I am," replied Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.3" type="verse">Then, as the High Priests went on heaping accusations on Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.4" type="verse">Pilate again and again asked Him, "Do you make no reply? Listen to the many charges they are bringing against you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.5" type="verse">But Jesus made no further answer: so that Pilate wondered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.6" type="verse">Now at the Festival it was customary for Pilate to release to the Jews any one prisoner whom they might beg off from punishment;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.7" type="verse">and at this time a man named Barabbas was in prison among the insurgents--persons who in the insurrection had committed murder.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.8" type="verse">So the people came crowding up, asking Pilate to grant them the usual favour.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.9" type="verse">"Shall I release for you the King of the Jews?" answered Pilate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.10" type="verse">For he could see that it was out of sheer spite that the High Priests had handed Him over.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.11" type="verse">But the High Priests urged on the crowd to obtain Barabbas's release in preference;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.12" type="verse">and when Pilate again asked them, "What then shall I do to the man you call King of the Jews?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.13" type="verse">they once more shouted out, "Crucify Him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.14" type="verse">"Why, what crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they vehemently shouted, "Crucify Him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.15" type="verse">So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the mob, released Barabbas for them, and after scourging Jesus handed Him over for crucifixion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.16" type="verse">Then the soldiers led Him away into the court of the Palace (the Praetorium), and calling together the whole battalion</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.17" type="verse">they arrayed Him in crimson, placed on His head a wreath of thorny twigs which they had twisted,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.18" type="verse">and went on to salute Him with shouts of "Long live the King of the Jews."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.19" type="verse">Then they began to beat Him on the head with a  cane, to spit on Him, and to do Him homage on bended knees.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.20" type="verse">At last, having finished their sport, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.21" type="verse">One Simon, a Cyrenaean, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing along, coming from the country: him they compelled to carry His cross.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.22" type="verse">So they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which, being translated, means `Skull-ground.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.23" type="verse">Here they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He refused it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.24" type="verse">Then they crucified Him. This done, they divided His garments among them, drawing lots to decide what each should take.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.25" type="verse">It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.26" type="verse">Over His head was the notice in writing of the charge against Him: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.27" type="verse">And together with Jesus they crucified two robbers, one at His right hand and one at His left.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.28" type="verse">[]</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.29" type="verse">And all the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him and said, "Ah! you who were for destroying the Sanctuary and building a new one in three days,</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.30" type="verse">come down from the cross and save yourself."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.31" type="verse">In the same way the High Priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on scoffing at Him, saying to one another, "He has  saved others:  himself he cannot save!</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.32" type="verse">This Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Even the men who were being crucified with Him heaped insults on Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.15.34" type="verse">But at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &amp;lt;"Elohi, Elohi, lama sabachthani?"&amp;gt; which means, "My God, My God, &amp;lt;why hast Thou forsaken me?"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.35" type="verse">Some of the bystanders, hearing Him, said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.36" type="verse">Then a man ran to fill a sponge with  sour wine, and he put it on the end of a cane and placed it to His lips, saying at the same time, "Wait! let us see whether Elijah will come and take him down."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.37" type="verse">But Jesus uttered a loud cry and yielded up His spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.38" type="verse">And the curtain in the Sanctuary  was torn in two, from top to bottom.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.39" type="verse">And when the  Centurion who stood in front of the cross saw that He was dead, he exclaimed, "This man was indeed God's Son."</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.40" type="verse">There were also a party of women looking on from a distance; among them being both Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joses, and Salome--</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.15.43" type="verse">Joseph of Arimathaea came, a  highly respected member of the  Council, who himself also was living in expectation of the Kingdom of God. He summoned up courage to go in to see Pilate and beg for the body of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.15.44" type="verse">But Pilate could hardly believe that He was already dead. He called, however, for the Centurion and inquired whether He had been long dead;</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.15.46" type="verse">He, having bought a sheet of linen, took Him down, wrapped Him in the sheet and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock; after which he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.</seg>

          <seg id="b.MAR.16.14" type="verse">Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had seen Him alive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.16.15" type="verse">Then He said to them, "Go the whole world over, and proclaim the Good News to all  mankind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.16.16" type="verse">He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</seg>
          <seg id="b.MAR.16.17" type="verse">And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these. By making use of my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak  new languages.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.1.1" type="verse">Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative of the facts which are  received with full assurance among us</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.2" type="verse">on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and were devoted to  the service of the divine Message,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.3" type="verse">it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation of the facts from their commencement, to write for you, most noble Theophilus, a connected account,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.4" type="verse">that you may fully know the truth of the things which you have been taught by word of mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.5" type="verse">There was in the time of Herod, the king of Judaea, a priest of the name of  Zechariah, belonging to the class of  Abijah. He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was  Elizabeth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.6" type="verse">They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.7" type="verse">But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren; and both of them were far advanced in life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.8" type="verse">Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed course of his class,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.9" type="verse">it fell to his lot--according to the custom of the priesthood--to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.10" type="verse">and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying, at the hour of incense.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.11" type="verse">Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.12" type="verse">and Zechariah on seeing him was  agitated and terrified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.13" type="verse">But the angel said to him,  "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard: and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.14" type="verse">Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice over his birth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.15" type="verse">For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.16" type="verse">Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.17" type="verse">and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children, and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright, to make a people perfectly ready for the lord."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.18" type="verse">"By what proof," asked Zechariah, "shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.19" type="verse">"I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God," answered the angel, "and I have been sent to talk with you and tell you this good news.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.20" type="verse">And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words--words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.21" type="verse">Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.22" type="verse">When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary; but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.23" type="verse">When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.24" type="verse">and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself secluded five months.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.25" type="verse">"Thus has the Lord dealt with me," she said, "now that He has  graciously taken away my reproach among men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.26" type="verse">Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called  Nazareth,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.27" type="verse">to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was  Mary.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.28" type="verse">So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, "Joy be to you, favoured one! the Lord is  with you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.29" type="verse">She was greatly  agitated at his words, and wondered what such a greeting meant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.30" type="verse">But the angel said,  "Do not be frightened, Mary, for you have found favour with God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.31" type="verse">You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are to call His name  JESUS.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.32" type="verse">He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.' And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.33" type="verse">and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages, and of His Kingdom there will be no end."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.34" type="verse">"How can this be," Mary replied, "seeing that I have no husband?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.35" type="verse">The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for this reason your holy  offspring will be called `the Son of God.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.36" type="verse">And see, your relative Elizabeth--she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.37" type="verse">For no promise from God will be  impossible of fulfilment."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.38" type="verse">"I am the Lord's  maidservant," Mary replied; "may it be with me in accordance with your words!" And then the angel left her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.39" type="verse">Not long after this, Mary rose up and went  in haste into the hill country to a town in Judah.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.40" type="verse">Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.41" type="verse">and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt within her. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.42" type="verse">and uttered a loud  cry of joy.  "Blest among women are you," she said, "and the offspring of your body is blest!</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.43" type="verse">But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.44" type="verse">For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within me leapt for joy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.45" type="verse">And blessed is she  who has believed,  for the word spoken to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.46" type="verse">Then Mary said: "My soul extols the Lord,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.47" type="verse">And my spirit  triumphs in God my  Saviour;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.48" type="verse">Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position; For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.49" type="verse">Because the mighty One has done great things for me--Holy is His name!--</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.50" type="verse">And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those who fear Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.51" type="verse">He  has manifested His supreme strength. He has scattered those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.52" type="verse">He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men of low estate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.53" type="verse">The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich He has sent empty-handed away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.54" type="verse">His servant Israel He has helped,  Remembering His compassion--</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.55" type="verse">In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers--For Abraham and his posterity for ever."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.56" type="verse">So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned home.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.57" type="verse">Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.58" type="verse">and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord  had had great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.59" type="verse">And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.60" type="verse">His mother, however, said, "No, he is to be called John."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.61" type="verse">"There is not one of your family," they said, "who has that name."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.62" type="verse">They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.63" type="verse">So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." And they all wondered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.64" type="verse">Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began to speak and bless God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.65" type="verse">And all who lived round about them were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all these things were spread abroad.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.66" type="verse">All who heard the story treasured it in their memories. "What then will this child be?" they said. For the lord's hand was indeed with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.67" type="verse">And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke in a rapture of praise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.68" type="verse">"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel," he said, "Because He  has not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.69" type="verse">And has raised up  a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of David His servant--</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.70" type="verse">As He has spoken  from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets--</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.71" type="verse">To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.72" type="verse">He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered His holy covenant,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.73" type="verse">The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.74" type="verse">To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And so render worship to Him free from fear,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.75" type="verse">In  piety and uprightness before Him all our days.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.76" type="verse">And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.77" type="verse">To give to His People a knowledge of  salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.78" type="verse">Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which the daybreak from on high  will come to us,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.79" type="verse">Dawning on those who now  dwell in the darkness and shadow of death--To direct our feet into the path of peace."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.1.80" type="verse">And the child grew and became strong in character, and lived in the  Desert till the time came for him to appear publicly to Israel.</seg>

        <div id="b.LUK.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.1" type="verse">Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus for the  registration of  the whole Empire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.2" type="verse">It was the first registration made during the governorship of Quirinius in Syria;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.3" type="verse">and all went to be registered--every one to the town to which he belonged.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.4" type="verse">So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judaea, to David's town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.5" type="verse">to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was with child.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.6" type="verse">But while they were there, her full time came,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.7" type="verse">and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the  inn.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.8" type="verse">Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country, keeping watch over their sheep by night  in the open fields,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.9" type="verse">when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.10" type="verse">But the angel said to them, "Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy--joy for all the People.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.11" type="verse">For a  Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.12" type="verse">And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.13" type="verse">And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.14" type="verse">"Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among  men who please Him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.15" type="verse">Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.16" type="verse">So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.2.19" type="verse">But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.20" type="verse">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.21" type="verse">When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.22" type="verse">And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord--</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.2.24" type="verse">And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, &amp;lt;"a pair of  turtle doves or two young pigeons."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.25" type="verse">Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.26" type="verse">To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should  not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.27" type="verse">Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.28" type="verse">he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.2.33" type="verse">And while the child's father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.34" type="verse">Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, "This child  is appointed for the falling and the  uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.35" type="verse">and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings  in many hearts may be  revealed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.36" type="verse">There was also  Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.2.38" type="verse">And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the  deliverance of Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.39" type="verse">Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.40" type="verse">And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.41" type="verse">Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.42" type="verse">And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.43" type="verse">after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.44" type="verse">but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day's journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.45" type="verse">but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.46" type="verse">On the third day they found Him in  the Temple sitting among the  Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them  questions,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.2.48" type="verse">When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, "My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.49" type="verse">"Why is it that you have been searching for me?" He replied; "did you not know that it is my duty  to be engaged upon my Father's business?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.50" type="verse">But they did not understand the significance of these words.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.2.51" type="verse">Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these  incidents in her memory.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.3.5" type="verse">Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill levelled down, the crooked places shall be turned into straight roads, and the rugged ways into smooth;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.6" type="verse">and then shall all mankind see God's salvation.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.7" type="verse">Accordingly John used to say to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, "O vipers'  brood, who has  warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.8" type="verse">Live lives which shall prove your change of heart; and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can  raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.9" type="verse">And even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree  which fails to yield good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.10" type="verse">The crowds repeatedly asked him, "What then are we to do?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.11" type="verse">"Let the man who has two  coats," he answered, "give one to the man who has none; and let the man who has food share it with others."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.12" type="verse">There came also a party of tax-gatherers to be baptized, and they asked him,  "Rabbi, what are we to do?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.13" type="verse">"Do not exact more than the legal amount," he replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.14" type="verse">The soldiers also once and again inquired of him, "And we, what are we to do?" His answer was, "Neither intimidate any one nor lay false charges; and be content with your pay."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.15" type="verse">And while the people were in suspense and all were debating in their minds whether John might possibly be the Anointed One,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.16" type="verse">he answered the question by saying to them all, "As for me, I am baptizing you with water, but One mightier than I is coming, whose very sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten: He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.17" type="verse">His winnowing-shovel is in His hand to clear out His threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into His storehouse; but the chaff He will burn up in fire unquenchable."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.18" type="verse">With many exhortations besides these he declared the Good News to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.19" type="verse">But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds that he had done,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.20" type="verse">now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw John into prison.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.21" type="verse">Now when  all the people  had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.3.22" type="verse">and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove, upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, "Thou art My Son, dearly loved: in Thee  is My delight."</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.4.1" type="verse">Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led about  by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.2" type="verse">tempted all the while by the Devil. During those days He ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.3" type="verse">Then the Devil said to Him,  "If you are God's Son, tell this stone to become bread."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.4" type="verse">"It is written," replied Jesus, &amp;lt;"`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live.'"&amp;gt; </seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.5" type="verse">The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see  at a glance all the kingdoms of the world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.6" type="verse">And the Devil said to Him, "To you will I give all this authority and  this splendour; for it has been handed over to me, and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.7" type="verse">If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.8" type="verse">Jesus answered him, "It is written, &amp;lt;`To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.9" type="verse">Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are God's Son, throw yourself down from here; for it is written,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.10" type="verse">&amp;lt;`He will give orders to His angels concerning thee, to guard thee safely;'&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.4.12" type="verse">The reply of Jesus was, "It is said, &amp;lt;`Thou shalt not put the Lord they God to the proof.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.13" type="verse">So the Devil, having  fully tried  every kind of temptation on Him, left Him  for a time.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.14" type="verse">Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee; and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.15" type="verse">And  He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning praise from all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.16" type="verse">He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up; and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.17" type="verse">And there was handed to Him the  book of the Prophet Isaiah, and, opening the book, He found the place where it was written,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.18" type="verse">&amp;lt;"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind: to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.19" type="verse">to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.20" type="verse">And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant, and  sat down--to speak. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.21" type="verse">Then He proceeded to say to them, "To-day is this Scripture fulfilled in your hearing."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.22" type="verse">And they all  spoke well of Him, wondering at the  sweet words of kindness which fell from His lips, while they asked one another, "Is not this Joseph's son?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.23" type="verse">"Doubtless," said He, "you will quote to me the proverb, `Physician, cure yourself: all that we hear that you have done  at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.24" type="verse">"I tell you  in solemn truth," He added, "that no Prophet is welcomed among his own people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.25" type="verse">But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel in the time of Elijah, when  there was no rain for three years and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.26" type="verse">and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent:  he was only sent to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.27" type="verse">And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian was."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.28" type="verse">Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words, were filled with fury.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.29" type="verse">They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, to throw Him down the cliff;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.30" type="verse">but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.31" type="verse">So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.32" type="verse">And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He spoke with the language of authority.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.33" type="verse">But in the synagogue there was a man  possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. In a loud voice he cried out,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.34" type="verse">"Ha! Jesus the Nazarene, what have you to do with us? I know who you are--God's Holy One!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.35" type="verse">But Jesus rebuked the demon. "Silence!" He exclaimed; "come out of him." Upon this, the demon hurled the man into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing him any harm.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.36" type="verse">All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another, "What sort of language is this? For with authority and real power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.37" type="verse">And the talk about Him spread into every part of the neighbouring country.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.38" type="verse">Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was  suffering from an acute attack of fever; and they consulted Him about her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.39" type="verse">Then standing over her He  rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she at once rose and waited on them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.40" type="verse">At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one, and cured them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.41" type="verse">Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, "You are the Son of God." But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak, because they knew Him to be  the Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.42" type="verse">Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him, and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured to detain Him that He might not leave them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.43" type="verse">But He said to them, "I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose I was sent."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.4.44" type="verse">And  for some time He preached in the synagogues in  Galilee.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.5.1" type="verse">On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.2" type="verse">He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.3" type="verse">and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him to push out a little from land. Then He sat down and taught the crowd of people from the boat.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.4" type="verse">When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon,  "Push out into deep water, and  let down your nets for a haul."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.5" type="verse">"Rabbi," replied Peter, "all night long we have worked hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let down the nets."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.6" type="verse">This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their nets began to break.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.7" type="verse">So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats so that they almost sank.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.8" type="verse">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and exclaimed, "Master,  leave my boat, for I am a sinful man."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.9" type="verse">(For he was  astonished and terrified--he and all his companions--at the haul of fish which they had taken;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.10" type="verse">and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.) But Jesus replied to Simon, "Fear not: from this time you shall be a catcher of men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.11" type="verse">Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.12" type="verse">On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns, there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, "Sir, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.13" type="verse">Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" And instantly the leprosy left him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.14" type="verse">He ordered him to tell no one. "But go," He said, "show yourself to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification which Moses appointed, as evidence for them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.15" type="verse">But all the more the report about Him spread abroad, and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.16" type="verse">but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert and there prayed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.17" type="verse">One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law  sitting there who had come from every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present  for Him to cure people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.18" type="verse">And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed, and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.19" type="verse">But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling--bed and all--into the midst, in front of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.20" type="verse">He saw their faith and said to him,  "Friend, your sins are  forgiven."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.21" type="verse">Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, "Who is  this, uttering blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.22" type="verse">Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions by asking in turn,  "What is this that you are debating in your hearts?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.23" type="verse">Which is easier? --to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.24" type="verse">But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" --Turning to the paralytic He said, "I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.25" type="verse">Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress on which he had been lying, and went away to his home, giving glory to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.26" type="verse">Amazement seized them all. "Glory to God!" was the abiding feeling. Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, "We have seen strange things to-day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.27" type="verse">After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, "Follow me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.28" type="verse">He rose, left everything, and followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.29" type="verse">Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers and others at table with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.30" type="verse">This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate with His disciples and ask, "Why are you eating and drinking with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.31" type="verse">But Jesus replied to them, "It is not men in good health who require a physician, but the sick.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.32" type="verse">I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.33" type="verse">Again they said to Him, "John's disciples fast often and pray, as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.34" type="verse">"Can you compel the bridal party to fast," replied Jesus, "so long as they have the bridegroom among them?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.35" type="verse">But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been taken away from them: then, at that time, they will fast."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.36" type="verse">He also spoke in figurative language to them. "No one," He said, "tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one. Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch from the new would not match the old.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.37" type="verse">Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.38" type="verse">But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.5.39" type="verse">Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new; for he says, `The old is  better.'"</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.7.6" type="verse">Then Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the Captain sent friends to Him with the message: "Sir, do not trouble to come.  I am not worthy of having you come under my roof;</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.7.29" type="verse">And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being baptized with John's baptism.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.30" type="verse">But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated  God's purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be  baptized.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.7.37" type="verse">And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner. Having learnt that Jesus  was at table in the Pharisee's house she brought a flask of perfume,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.38" type="verse">and, standing  behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured the perfume over them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.39" type="verse">Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself,  "This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching him--and would know that she is an immoral woman."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.40" type="verse">In answer to  his thoughts Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have a word to say to you."  "Rabbi, say on," he replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.41" type="verse">"There were once two men in debt to one money-lender," said Jesus; "one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.7.43" type="verse">"I suppose," replied Simon, "the one to whom he forgave most." "You have judged rightly," Jesus rejoined.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.44" type="verse">Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house: you gave me no water for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears, and then wiped the tears away with her hair.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.45" type="verse">No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has not left off tenderly kissing my feet.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.7.47" type="verse">This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins,  are forgiven--because she has loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.48" type="verse">And He said to her, "Your sins  are forgiven."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.7.49" type="verse">Then the other guests began to say to themselves, "Who can this man be who even forgives sins?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.1" type="verse">Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village after village, proclaiming His Message and telling  the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.2" type="verse">and certain women whom He had  delivered from evil spirits and various diseases--Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had come,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.4" type="verse">And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.5" type="verse">"The sower," He said,  "goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon, or the birds of the air come and peck it up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.6" type="verse">Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it withers away for want of moisture.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.8" type="verse">But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and yields a return of a hundred for one." While thus speaking, He cried aloud and said, "Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.9" type="verse">The disciples  proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.10" type="verse">"To you," He replied, "it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables, in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear and yet not understand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.11" type="verse">The meaning of the parable is as follows. The seed is God's Message.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.12" type="verse">Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.13" type="verse">Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive it joyfully; but they have no root: for a time they believe, but when trial comes they fall away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.14" type="verse">That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard, but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield nothing in perfection.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.15" type="verse">But as for that in the good ground, it means those who, having listened to the Message with open  minds and in a right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.16" type="verse">"When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a vessel or hide it under  a couch; he puts it on  a lampstand, that people who enter the room may see the light.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.19" type="verse">Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get near Him for the crowd.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.20" type="verse">But He was told, "Your mother and brothers are standing on the edge of the crowd, and want to see you."</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.25" type="verse">"Where is your faith?" He asked them. But they were filled with terror and amazement, and said to one another, "Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves, and they obey Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.26" type="verse">Then they put in to shore in the country of the  Gerasenes, which lies opposite to Galilee.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.27" type="verse">Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was possessed by demons--for a long time he had not put on any garment, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.28" type="verse">When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Do not torture me, I beseech you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.29" type="verse">For already He  had been commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. For  many a time it had seized and held him, and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces, and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.30" type="verse">"What is your name?" Jesus asked him. "Legion," he replied--because a great number of demons had entered into him;</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.32" type="verse">Now there was  a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them, and He gave them leave.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.33" type="verse">The demons  came out of the man and left him, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff into the Lake and were drowned.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.34" type="verse">The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported it both in town and country;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.35" type="verse">whereupon the people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were terrified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.36" type="verse">And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.37" type="verse">Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent districts begged Him to depart from them; for  their terror was great. So He went on board and returned.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.8.45" type="verse">"Who is it touched me?" Jesus asked. And when all denied having done so, Peter and the rest said, "Rabbi, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing on you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.46" type="verse">"Some one has touched me," Jesus replied, "for  I feel that power has gone out from me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.47" type="verse">Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she stated before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.48" type="verse">"Daughter," said He, "your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace." </seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.49" type="verse">While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of the Synagogue from his house and said, "Your daughter is dead; trouble the  Rabbi no further."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.50" type="verse">Jesus heard the words and said to him, "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.51" type="verse">So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.52" type="verse">The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her; but He said, "Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.53" type="verse">And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.54" type="verse">He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, "Child, awake!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.55" type="verse">And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up; and He directed them to give her some food.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.8.56" type="verse">Her parents were  astounded; but He forbad them to mention the matter to any one.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.9.1" type="verse">Then calling the Twelve together He conferred on them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.2" type="verse">and sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to cure  the sick.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.3" type="verse">And He commanded them, "Take nothing for your journey; neither stick nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have an extra under garment.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.9.6" type="verse">So they departed and visited village after village, spreading the Good News and performing cures everywhere.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.7" type="verse">Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was going on; and he was bewildered because of its being said by some that John had come back to life,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.9.9" type="verse">And Herod said, "John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such reports?" And he sought for an opportunity of seeing Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.10" type="verse">The Apostles, on their return, related to Jesus all they had done. Then He took them and withdrew to a quiet retreat,  to a town called Bethsaida.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.11" type="verse">But the immense crowd, aware of this, followed Him; and receiving them kindly He proceeded to speak to them of the Kingdom of God, and those who needed to be restored to health, He cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.12" type="verse">Now when the day began to decline, the Twelve came to Him and said, "Send the people away, that they may go to the villages and farms round about and find lodging and a supply of food; because here we are in an uninhabited district."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.13" type="verse">"You yourselves," He said, "must give them food." "We have nothing," they replied, "but five loaves and a couple of fish, unless indeed we were to go and buy provisions for all this host of people."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.14" type="verse">(For there were about 5,000 adult men.) But He said to His disciples, "Make them sit down in parties of about fifty each."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.15" type="verse">They did so, making them all, without exception, sit down.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.16" type="verse">Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed them and broke them into portions which He gave to the disciples  to distribute to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.17" type="verse">So they ate and were fully satisfied, all of them; and what they had remaining over was gathered up, twelve baskets of fragments.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.18" type="verse">One day when He was praying by Himself the disciples were present; and He asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.9.21" type="verse">And Jesus strictly forbad them to tell this to any one;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.22" type="verse">and He said, "The Son of Man must suffer much cruelty, be rejected by the Elders and High Priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day  be raised to life again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.23" type="verse">And He said to all, "If any one is desirous of following me, let him  ignore self and take up his cross day by day, and so be my follower.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.9.26" type="verse">For whoever shall have been ashamed of me and my teachings, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own and the Father's glory and in that of the holy angels.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.27" type="verse">I tell you truly that there are some of those who stand here who will certainly not taste death  till they have seen the Kingdom of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.28" type="verse">It was about eight days after this that Jesus, taking with Him Peter, John, and James, went  up the mountain to pray.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.29" type="verse">And while He was praying the appearance of His face underwent a change, and His clothing became white and  radiant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.30" type="verse">And suddenly there were two men conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.31" type="verse">They  came in glory, and kept speaking about His death, which He was so soon to undergo in Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.32" type="verse">Now Peter and the others were weighed down with sleep; but, keeping themselves awake all through, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.33" type="verse">And when they were preparing to depart from Him, Peter said to Jesus,  "Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three tents--one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not know what he was saying.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.34" type="verse">But while he was thus speaking, there came a cloud which  spread over them; and they were awe-struck when  they had entered into the cloud.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.35" type="verse">Then there came a voice from within the cloud: "This is My Son, My Chosen One: listen to Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.36" type="verse">After this voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept it to themselves, and said not a word to any one at that time about what they had seen.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.37" type="verse">On the following day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great crowd came to meet Him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.38" type="verse">and a man from the crowd called out,  "Rabbi,  I beg you to pity my son, for he is my only child.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.39" type="verse">At times a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him, and makes him foam at the mouth, and  does not leave him till it has well-nigh covered him with bruises.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.40" type="verse">I entreated your disciples to expel the spirit, but they could not."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.41" type="verse">"O unbelieving and perverse generation!" replied Jesus; "how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.42" type="verse">Now while the youth was coming, the spirit  dashed him to the ground and cruelly convulsed him. But Jesus  rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the youth and gave him back to his father.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.43" type="verse">And all were awe-struck at the  mighty power of God. And while every one was expressing wonder at all that He was doing, He said to his disciples,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.44" type="verse">"As for you, store these my sayings in your  memory; for, before long, the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.45" type="verse">But they did not understand His meaning: it was  veiled from them that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.46" type="verse">Now there arose a dispute among them, which of them was to be the greatest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.47" type="verse">And Jesus,  knowing the reasoning that was in their hearts, took a young child and made him stand by His side</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.48" type="verse">and said to them,  "Whoever  for my sake receives this little child, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives Him who sent me. For the lowliest among you all--he is the  greatest."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.49" type="verse">"Rabbi," replied John, "we have seen a man making use of your name to expel demons; and we forbad him, because he does not come with us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.50" type="verse">"Do not forbid him," said Jesus, "for he who is not against you is on your side."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.51" type="verse">Now when the time drew near for Him to be received up again into Heaven, He proceeded with fixed purpose towards Jerusalem, and sent messengers before Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.52" type="verse">They went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.53" type="verse">But the people there would not receive Him, because He was evidently going to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.54" type="verse">When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Master, do you wish us to order fire to come down from Heaven and  consume them?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.55" type="verse">But He turned and rebuked them. </seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.56" type="verse">And they went to another village.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.57" type="verse">And, as they proceeded on their way, a man came to Him and said, "I will follow you wherever you go."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.58" type="verse">"The foxes have holes," said Jesus, "and the birds of the air have  nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.59" type="verse">"Follow me," He said to another. "Master," the man replied, "allow me first to go and bury my  father."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.60" type="verse">"Leave the dead," Jesus rejoined, "to bury their own dead; but you must go and announce far and wide  the coming of the Kingdom of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.61" type="verse">"Master," said yet another, "I will follow you; but allow me first to go and say good-bye to my friends at home."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.9.62" type="verse">Jesus answered him, "No one who has put his hand to the plough, and then looks behind him, is  fit for the Kingdom of God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.14.1" type="verse">One day--it was a Sabbath--He was  taking a meal at the house of one of the Rulers of the Pharisee party, while they were closely watching Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.2" type="verse">In front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.3" type="verse">This led Jesus to ask the lawyers and Pharisees, "Is it allowable to cure people on the Sabbath?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.4" type="verse">They gave Him no answer; so He took hold of the man, cured him, and sent him away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.5" type="verse">Then He turned to them and said, "Which of you shall have a  child or an ox fall into a well on the Sabbath day, and will not immediately lift him out?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.6" type="verse">To this they could make no reply.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.7" type="verse">Then, when He noticed that the invited guests chose the best  seats, He used this as an illustration and said to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.8" type="verse">"When any one invites you to a wedding banquet, do not take the best seat, lest perhaps some more honoured guest than you may have been asked,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.14.10" type="verse">On the contrary, when you are invited go and take the lowest place, that when your host comes round he may say to you, `My friend, come up higher.' This will be  doing you honour in the presence of all the other guests.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.11" type="verse">For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be uplifted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.12" type="verse">Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, "When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.13" type="verse">But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.14" type="verse">and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you, but there will be requital for you at the  Resurrection of the righteous."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.15" type="verse">After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.14.16" type="verse">"A man once gave  a great dinner," replied Jesus, "to which he invited a large number of guests.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.14.18" type="verse">"But they all without exception began to excuse themselves. The first told him, "`I have purchased a piece of land, and must of necessity go and look at it. Pray hold me excused.'</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.14.22" type="verse">"Soon the servant reported the result, saying, "`Sir, what you ordered is done, and there is room still.'</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.18.9" type="verse">And to some who relied on themselves as being righteous men, and looked down upon all others, He addressed this parable.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.18.10" type="verse">"Two men went up to the Temple to pray," He said; "one being a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.19.1" type="verse">So He entered Jericho and was passing through the town.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.2" type="verse">There was a man there called Zacchaeus, who was the local surveyor of taxes, and was wealthy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.3" type="verse">He was anxious to see what sort of man Jesus was; but he could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.4" type="verse">So he ran on in front and climbed up a mulberry tree to see Him; for He was about to pass that way.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.5" type="verse">As soon as Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house to-day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.6" type="verse">So he came down in haste, and welcomed Him joyfully.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.7" type="verse">When they all saw this, they began to complain with indignation. "He has gone in to be the guest of a notorious sinner!" they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.8" type="verse">Zacchaeus however stood up, and addressing the Lord said,  "Here and now, Master, I give half my  property to the poor, and if I have unjustly exacted money from any man, I pledge myself to repay to him four times the amount."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.9" type="verse">Turning towards him, Jesus replied, "To-day salvation has come to this house, seeing that he too is a son of Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.10" type="verse">For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.11" type="verse">As they were listening to His words, He went on to teach them by a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.12" type="verse">So He said to them, "A man of noble family travelled to a distant country to obtain the rank of king, and to return.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.13" type="verse">And he called ten of his  servants and gave each of them  a pound, instructing them to trade with the money  during his absence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.14" type="verse">"Now his countrymen hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, `We are not willing that he should become our king.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.15" type="verse">And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty, he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money to be summoned before him, that he might learn their success in trading.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.16" type="verse">"So the first came and said, "`Sir, your pound has produced ten pounds more.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.17" type="verse">"`Well done, good servant,' he replied; `because you have been faithful in a very small matter, be in authority over ten towns.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.18" type="verse">"The second came, and said, "`Your pound, Sir, has produced five pounds.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.19" type="verse">"So he said to this one also, "`And you, be the governor of five towns.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.20" type="verse">"The next came. "`Sir,' he said, `here is your pound, which I have kept wrapt up in a cloth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.21" type="verse">For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.22" type="verse">"`By your own words,' he replied, `I will judge you, you bad servant. You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.23" type="verse">why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I came I might have received it back with interest?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.24" type="verse">"And he said to those who stood by, "`Take the pound from him and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.25" type="verse">("They said to him, "`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.19.27" type="verse">But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I should become their king, bring them here, and cut them to pieces in my presence.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.28" type="verse">After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.29" type="verse">And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called  the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.30" type="verse">saying to them, "Go into the village facing you. On entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie it, and bring it here.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.31" type="verse">And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?' simply say,  `The Master needs it.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.32" type="verse">So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.33" type="verse">And while they were untying the colt the owners called out, "Why are you untying the colt?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.34" type="verse">and they replied,  "The Master needs it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.35" type="verse">Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.36" type="verse">So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.37" type="verse">And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty deeds they had witnessed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.38" type="verse">&amp;lt;"Blessed is&amp;gt; the King," they cried, &amp;lt;"who comes in the name of the Lord:&amp;gt; in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.39" type="verse">Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him, saying,  "Rabbi, reprove your disciples."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.40" type="verse">"I tell you," He replied, "that if *they* became silent, the very stones would cry out."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.41" type="verse">When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud over it, and exclaimed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.42" type="verse">"O that at this time thou hadst known--yes even thou--what makes peace possible! But now it is hid from thine eyes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.43" type="verse">For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee  earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming thee in on every side.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.44" type="verse">And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee, and will not leave one stone upon another within thee; because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.19.45" type="verse">Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive out the dealers.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.19.47" type="verse">And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him, as were also the leading men of the people.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.20.1" type="verse">On one of those days while He was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Good News, the High Priests came upon Him, and the Scribes,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.2" type="verse">together with the Elders, and they asked Him, "Tell us, By what authority are you doing these things? And who is it that gave you this authority?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.3" type="verse">"I also will put a question to you, "He said;</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.20.5" type="verse">So they debated the matter with one another. "If we say `Heavenly,'" they argued, "he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.6" type="verse">And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us; for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.7" type="verse">And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.8" type="verse">"Nor will I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.9" type="verse">Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people. "There was a man," He said, "who planted a vineyard, let it out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.10" type="verse">At vintage-time he sent a  servant to the vine-dressers, for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.11" type="verse">Then he sent a second  servant; and him too they beat and ill treated and sent away empty-handed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.12" type="verse">Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded and drove away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.13" type="verse">Then the owner of the vineyard said, "`What am I to do? I will send my son--my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.14" type="verse">"But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed the matter with one another, and said, "`This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.15" type="verse">"So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.16" type="verse">He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give the vineyard to others."  "God forbid!" exclaimed the hearers.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.20.18" type="verse">Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt, but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.19" type="verse">At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands on Him,  then and there; only they were afraid of the people. For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.20" type="verse">So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent spies who were to act the part of good and honest men, that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.20.21" type="verse">So they put a question to Him.  "Rabbi," they said, "we know that you say and teach what is right and that  you make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach God's way truly.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.20.27" type="verse">Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.4" type="verse">He went and conferred with the High Priests and  Commanders as to how he should deliver Him up to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.5" type="verse">This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.6" type="verse">He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity to betray Him when the people were not there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.7" type="verse">When the day of the Unleavened Bread came--the day for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed--</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.8" type="verse">Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions. "Go," He said, "and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.10" type="verse">"You will no sooner have entered the city," He replied, "than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house to which he goes,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.13" type="verse">So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.20" type="verse">He gave them the cup in like manner, when  the meal was over. "This cup," He said, "is the new Covenant ratified  by my blood which  is to be poured out on your behalf.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.23" type="verse">Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them it could possibly be who was about to do this.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.24" type="verse">There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be  regarded as greatest.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.36" type="verse">"But now," said He, "let the one who has a purse take it, and he who has a bag must do the same. And let him who has no sword sell his outer garment and  buy one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.37" type="verse">For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their fulfilment in me: &amp;lt;`And He was reckoned among the lawless';&amp;gt; for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.38" type="verse">"Master, here are two swords," they exclaimed. "That is enough," He replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.39" type="verse">On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.40" type="verse">But when He arrived at the place, He said to them,  "Pray that you may not come into temptation."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.41" type="verse">But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.42" type="verse">"Father, if it be Thy will,  take this  cup away from me; yet not my will but Thine be done!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.43" type="verse">And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.45" type="verse">When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.46" type="verse">"Why are you sleeping?" He said;  "stand up; and pray that you may not come into temptation."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.47" type="verse">While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head. He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.48" type="verse">"Judas," said Jesus, "are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.49" type="verse">Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen, asked Him, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.52" type="verse">Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, "Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.53" type="verse">While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour--and the power of darkness."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.54" type="verse">And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.55" type="verse">And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was sitting among them,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.57" type="verse">But he denied it, and declared, "Woman, I do not know him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.58" type="verse">Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, "You, too, are one of them." "No, man, I am not," said Peter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.59" type="verse">After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained: "Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact he is a Galilaean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.60" type="verse">"Man, I don't know what you mean," replied Peter. No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.61" type="verse">The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected the Master's words, how He had said to him, "This very day, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.62" type="verse">And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.63" type="verse">Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat Him in cruel sport,</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.22.69" type="verse">But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of God's omnipotence."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.70" type="verse">Thereupon they cried out with one voice, "You, then, are the Son of God?" "It is as you say," He answered;  "I am He."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.22.71" type="verse">"What need have we of further evidence?" they said; "for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips."</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.23.9" type="verse">So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave him no reply.</seg>

          <seg id="b.LUK.23.18" type="verse">Then the whole multitude burst out into a shout. "Away with this man," they said, "and release Barabbas to us"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.19" type="verse">--Barabbas! who had been lodged in jail for some time in connexion with a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.20" type="verse">But Pilate once more addressed them, wishing to set Jesus free.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.21" type="verse">They, however, persistently shouted, "Crucify, crucify him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.22" type="verse">A third time he appealed to them:  "Why, what crime has the man committed? I have discovered in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.23" type="verse">But they urgently insisted, demanding with frantic outcries that He should be crucified; and their clamour prevailed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.24" type="verse">So Pilate gave judgement, yielding to their demand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.25" type="verse">The man who was lying in prison charged with riot and murder and for whom they clamoured he set free, but Jesus he gave up to be dealt with as they desired.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.26" type="verse">As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, and on his shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.27" type="verse">A vast crowd of the people also followed Him, and of women who were beating their breasts and wailing for Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.28" type="verse">But Jesus turned towards them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.29" type="verse">For a time is coming when they will say, `Blessed are the women who never bore children, and the breasts which have never given nourishment.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.30" type="verse">Then will they begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us;' and to the hills, `Cover us.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.31" type="verse">For if they are doing these things in the case of the green tree, what will be done in that of the dry?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.32" type="verse">They brought also two others, criminals, to put them to death with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.33" type="verse">When they reached the place called `The Skull,' there they nailed Him to the cross, and the criminals also, one at His right hand and one at His left.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.34" type="verse">Jesus prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing." And they divided His garments among them, drawing lots for them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.35" type="verse">and the people stood looking on. The Rulers, too, repeatedly uttered their bitter taunts. "This fellow," they said, "saved others: let him save himself, if he is God's Anointed, the Chosen One."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.36" type="verse">And the soldiers also made sport of Him, coming and offering Him  sour wine and saying,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.37" type="verse">"Are *you* the King of the Jews? Save yourself, then!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.38" type="verse">There was moreover a writing over His head: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.39" type="verse">Now one of the criminals who had been crucified insulted Him, saying, "Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.40" type="verse">But the other, answering, reproved him.  "Do you also not fear God," he said, "when you are actually suffering the same punishment?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.41" type="verse">And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving due requital for what we have done. But He has done nothing amiss."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.42" type="verse">And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come  in your Kingdom."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.43" type="verse">"I tell you in solemn truth," replied Jesus, "that  this very day you shall be with me in Paradise."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.44" type="verse">It was now about noon, and a darkness came over the whole country till three o'clock in the  afternoon.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.45" type="verse">The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn down the middle,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.46" type="verse">and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and said, "Father, to Thy hands I entrust my spirit." And after uttering these words He yielded up His spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.47" type="verse">The Captain, seeing what had happened, gave glory to God, saying, "Beyond question this man was innocent."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.48" type="verse">And all the crowds that had come together to this sight, after seeing all that had occurred, returned to the city beating their breasts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.49" type="verse">But all His acquaintances, and the women who had been His followers after leaving Galilee, continued standing at a distance and looking on.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.50" type="verse">There was a member of the Council of the name of Joseph, a kind-hearted and upright man,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.51" type="verse">who came from the Jewish town of Arimathaea and was awaiting the coming of the Kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the design or action of the Council,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.52" type="verse">and now he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.53" type="verse">Then, taking it down, he wrapped it in a  linen sheet and laid it in a tomb in the rock, where no one else had yet been put.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.54" type="verse">It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was near at hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.55" type="verse">The women--those who had come with Jesus from Galilee--followed close behind, and saw the tomb and how His body was placed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.23.56" type="verse">Then they returned, and prepared spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the Commandment.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.LUK.24" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.1" type="verse">And, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.2" type="verse">But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.3" type="verse">and on entering they found that the body  of the Lord Jesus was not there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.4" type="verse">At this they were in great perplexity, when  suddenly there stood by them two men whose raiment  flashed like lightning.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.5" type="verse">The women were terrified; but, as they stood with their faces bowed to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you search among the dead for Him who is living?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.6" type="verse">He is not here. He has come back to life. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.7" type="verse">when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.8" type="verse">Then they remembered His words,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.9" type="verse">and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.10" type="verse">The women were Mary of  Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this to the Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.11" type="verse">But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could not believe the women.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.12" type="verse">Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw nothing but the  linen cloths: so he went away to his own home, wondering at what had happened.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.13" type="verse">On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.14" type="verse">and were conversing about all these recent events;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.15" type="verse">and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion, Jesus Himself came and joined them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.16" type="verse">though they were prevented from recognizing Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.17" type="verse">"What is the subject," He asked them, "on which you are talking so earnestly, as you  walk?" And they stood still, looking full of sorrow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.18" type="verse">Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered,  "Are you a stranger lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing of the things that have lately happened in the city?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.19" type="verse">"What things?" He asked. "The things about Jesus the Nazarene," they said, "who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.20" type="verse">and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.21" type="verse">But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel. Yes, and moreover it was  the day before yesterday that these things happened.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.22" type="verse">And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us. They went to the tomb at daybreak,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.23" type="verse">and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.24" type="verse">Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.25" type="verse">"O dull-witted men," He replied, "with  minds so slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.26" type="verse">Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer, and then enter into His glory?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.27" type="verse">And,  beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He  explained to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.28" type="verse">When they had come near the village to which they were going, He appeared to be going further.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.29" type="verse">But they pressed Him to remain with them. "Because," said they, "it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over." So He went in to stay with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.30" type="verse">But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the  bread and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.31" type="verse">their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. But He vanished from them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.32" type="verse">"Were not our hearts," they said to one another, "burning within us while He talked to us on the way and explained the Scriptures to us?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.33" type="verse">So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem, and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said  to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.34" type="verse">"Yes, it is true: the Master has come back to life. He has been seen by Simon."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.35" type="verse">Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He had been recognized by them in the breaking of the  bread.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.36" type="verse">While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst  and said, "Peace be to you!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.37" type="verse">Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were looking at a spirit;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.38" type="verse">but He said to them, "Why such alarm? And why are there such questionings in your minds?</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.39" type="verse">See my hands and my feet--it is my very self. Feel me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.40" type="verse">And then He showed them His hands and His feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.41" type="verse">But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full of astonishment, He asked them, "Have you any food here?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.42" type="verse">And they gave Him a piece of roasted  fish,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.43" type="verse">and He took it and ate it in their presence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.44" type="verse">And He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you--that everything must be fulfilled that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.45" type="verse">Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.46" type="verse">and He said, "Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise again from among the dead;</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.47" type="verse">and that proclamation would be made, in His name, of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.48" type="verse">You are witnesses as to these things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.49" type="verse">And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised gift to rest upon you. But, as for you,  wait patiently in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.50" type="verse">And He brought them out  to within view of Bethany, and then lifted up His hands and blessed them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.51" type="verse">And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.52" type="verse">They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.LUK.24.53" type="verse">Afterwards they were continually  in attendance at the Temple,  blessing God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.1.1" type="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.2" type="verse">He was in the beginning with God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.3" type="verse">All things came into being  through Him, and apart from Him nothing  that exists came into being.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.4" type="verse">In Him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.5" type="verse">The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not  overpowered it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.6" type="verse">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.7" type="verse">He came as a witness, in order that he might give testimony concerning the Light--so that all might believe through him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.8" type="verse">He was not the Light, but he  existed that he might give testimony concerning the Light.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.9" type="verse">The true Light was that which illumines  every man by its coming into the world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.10" type="verse">He was in the world, and the world came into existence through Him, and the world did not recognize Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.11" type="verse">He came to the things that were His own, and His own people gave Him no welcome.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.12" type="verse">But all who have received Him, to them--that is, to those who trust in His name--He has given the privilege of becoming children of God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.13" type="verse">who were begotten as such not  by  human descent, nor through an impulse  of their own nature, nor through the will of  a human father, but from God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.14" type="verse">And the Word came in the flesh, and  lived for a time in our midst, so that we saw His glory--the glory as of the Father's  only Son, sent from His presence. He was full of grace and truth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.15" type="verse">John gave testimony concerning Him and cried aloud, saying, "This is He of whom I said, `He who is coming after me has been put before me,' for He was before me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.16" type="verse">For He it is from whose fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.17" type="verse">For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.18" type="verse">No human eye has ever seen God:  the only Son, who is  in the Father's bosom--He has made Him known.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.19" type="verse">This also is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him a deputation of Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.20" type="verse">He avowed--he did not conceal the truth, but avowed, "I am not the Christ."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.21" type="verse">"What then?" they inquired; "are you Elijah?" "I am not," he said. "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he answered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.22" type="verse">So they pressed the question. "Who are you?" they said--"that we may take an answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.23" type="verse">"I am &amp;lt;the voice,"&amp;gt; he replied, &amp;lt;"of one crying aloud, `Make straight the Lord's way  in the Desert,'&amp;gt; fulfilling the words of the Prophet Isaiah."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.24" type="verse">They were Pharisees who had been sent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.25" type="verse">Again they questioned him. "Why then do you baptize," they said, "if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.26" type="verse">"I baptize in water only," John answered, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not know--</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.27" type="verse">He who is to come after me, and whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.28" type="verse">This conversation took place at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.29" type="verse">The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed,  "Look, that is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sin of the world!</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.30" type="verse">This is He about whom I said, `After me is to come One who has been put before me, because He was before me.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.31" type="verse">I did not yet know Him; but that He may be openly shown to Israel is the reason why I have come baptizing in water."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.32" type="verse">John also gave testimony by stating:  "I have seen the Spirit coming down like a dove out of Heaven; and it remained upon Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.33" type="verse">I did not yet know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, "`The One on whom you see the Spirit coming down, and remaining, He it is who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.34" type="verse">"This  I have seen, and I have become a witness that He is the Son of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.35" type="verse">Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.36" type="verse">when he saw Jesus passing by, and said, "Look! that is the Lamb of God!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.37" type="verse">The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.38" type="verse">Then Jesus turned round, and seeing them following He asked them, "What is your wish?"  "Rabbi," they replied--`Rabbi' means `Teacher' --"where are you staying?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.39" type="verse">"Come and you shall see," He said. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they remained and spent that day with Him. It was then about  ten o'clock in the morning.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.40" type="verse">Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John's exclamation and followed Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.41" type="verse">He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" --that is to say,  the Anointed One.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.42" type="verse">He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, son of John: you shall be called  Cephas" --that is to say, Peter (or `Rock').</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.43" type="verse">The next day, having decided to leave Bethany and go into Galilee, Jesus found Philip, and invited him to follow Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.44" type="verse">(Now Philip came from Bethsaida,  the same town as Andrew and Peter.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.45" type="verse">Then Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him about whom Moses in the Law wrote, as well as the Prophets--Jesus, the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.46" type="verse">"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" replied Nathanael. "Come and see," said Philip.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.47" type="verse">Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, and said of him, "Look! here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no  deceitfulness!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.1.48" type="verse">"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. "Before Philip called you," said Jesus, "when you were under the fig-tree I saw you."</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.2.1" type="verse">Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.2" type="verse">and Jesus also was invited and His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.3" type="verse">Now the wine ran short; whereupon the mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.4" type="verse">"Leave the matter in my hands," He replied;  "the time for me to act has not yet come."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.5" type="verse">His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he tells you to do,  do it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.6" type="verse">Now there were six stone jars standing there (in accordance with the Jewish regulations for purification), each large enough to hold twenty gallons or more.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.7" type="verse">Jesus said to the attendants, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.8" type="verse">Then He said, "Now, take some out, and carry it to the President of the feast."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.9" type="verse">So they carried some to him. And no sooner had the President tasted the water now turned into wine, than--not knowing where it came from, though the attendants who had drawn the water knew--he called to the bridegroom</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.10" type="verse">and said to him, "It is usual to put on the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then that which is inferior. But you have kept the good wine till now."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.11" type="verse">This, the first of His  miracles, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus displayed His glorious power; and His disciples believed in Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.12" type="verse">Afterwards He went down to Capernaum--He, and His mother, and His brothers, and His disciples; and they made a short stay there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.13" type="verse">But the Jewish Passover was approaching, and for this Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.14" type="verse">And He found in the Temple the dealers in cattle and sheep and in pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.15" type="verse">So He plaited a whip of  rushes, and drove all--both sheep and bullocks--out of the Temple. The small coin of the brokers He upset on the ground and overturned their tables.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.16" type="verse">And to the pigeon-dealers He said, "Take these things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.17" type="verse">This recalled to His disciples the words of Scripture, &amp;lt;"My zeal for Thy House will consume me."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.18" type="verse">So the Jews  asked Him, "What  proof of your authority do you exhibit to us, seeing that you do these things?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.19" type="verse">"Demolish this Sanctuary," said Jesus, "and in three days I will rebuild it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.20" type="verse">"It has taken forty-six years," replied the Jews, "to build this Sanctuary, and will you rebuild it in three days?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.21" type="verse">But He was speaking of the Sanctuary of His body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.22" type="verse">When however He had risen from among the dead, His disciples recollected that He  had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the  teaching which Jesus had given them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.23" type="verse">Now when He was in Jerusalem,  at the Festival of the Passover, many  became believers  in Him through watching the miracles He performed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.24" type="verse">But for His part, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.2.25" type="verse">and did not need any one's testimony concerning  a man, for He of Himself knew what was in the man.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.3.1" type="verse">Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus--a ruler among the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.2" type="verse">He came to Jesus by night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher from God; for no one can do these miracles which you are doing, unless God is with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.3" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless a man is born  anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.4" type="verse">"How is it possible," Nicodemus asked, "for a man to be born when he is old? Can he a second time enter his mother's womb and be born?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.5" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that unless a man is  born of water  and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.6" type="verse">Whatever has been  born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever has been born of the Spirit is spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.7" type="verse">Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all be born anew.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.8" type="verse">The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear its  sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So is it with every one who has been born of the Spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.9" type="verse">"How is all this possible?" asked Nicodemus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.10" type="verse">"Are you," replied Jesus, "`the  Teacher of Israel,' and yet do you not understand these things?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.11" type="verse">In most solemn truth I tell you that  we speak what we know, and give testimony of that of which we  were eye-witnesses, and yet you all reject our testimony.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.12" type="verse">If I have told you earthly things and none of you believe me, how will you believe me if I tell you of things in Heaven?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.13" type="verse">There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, but there is One who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose home is in Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.14" type="verse">And just as Moses lifted high the serpent in the Desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.3.16" type="verse">For so  greatly did God love the world that He gave His  only Son, that every one who trusts in Him may not perish but may have the Life of Ages.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.17" type="verse">For God  did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.18" type="verse">He who trusts in Him does not come up for judgement. He who does not trust has already received sentence, because he  has not his trust resting on the name of God's only Son.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.19" type="verse">And this is the  test by which men  are judged--the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than they loved the Light, because their deeds were wicked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.20" type="verse">For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light, for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.21" type="verse">But he who does  what is honest and right comes to the light, in order that his actions may be plainly shown to have been done  in God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.22" type="verse">After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea; and there He made a stay in company with them and baptized.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.23" type="verse">And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many  pools of water there; and people came and received baptism.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.24" type="verse">(For John was not yet in prison.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.25" type="verse">As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.26" type="verse">they came to John and reported to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and  great numbers of people are resorting to him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.27" type="verse">"A man cannot obtain anything," replied John, "unless it has been granted to him from Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.28" type="verse">You yourselves can bear witness to my having said, `I am not the Christ,' but  `I am His appointed forerunner.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.29" type="verse">He who has the bride is the bridegroom; and the bridegroom's friend who stands by his side and listens to him, rejoices heartily on account of the bridegroom's happiness. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.30" type="verse">He must grow greater, but I must grow less.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.31" type="verse">He who  comes from above is above all. He whose origin is from the earth is not only himself from the earth, his teaching also is from the earth. He who comes from Heaven  is above all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.32" type="verse">What He  has seen and heard, to that He bears witness; but His testimony no one receives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.33" type="verse">Any man who has received His testimony has  solemnly declared that God is true.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.34" type="verse">For He whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God does not give the Spirit  with limitations."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.35" type="verse">The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to His hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.3.36" type="verse">He who  believes in the Son has the Life of the Ages; he who  disobeys the Son will not  enter into Life, but God's anger remains upon him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.4.1" type="verse">Now as soon as the Master was aware that the Pharisees had heard it said, "Jesus is gaining and baptizing more disciples than John"--</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.2" type="verse">though Jesus Himself did not baptize them, but His disciples did--</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.3" type="verse">He left Judaea and returned to Galilee.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.4" type="verse">His road lay through Samaria,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.5" type="verse">and so He came to Sychar, a town in Samaria near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.6" type="verse">Jacob's  Well was there: and accordingly Jesus, tired out with His journey, sat down by the well to rest. It was about  six o'clock in the evening.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.7" type="verse">Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus asked her to give Him some water;</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.4.9" type="verse">"How is it," replied the woman, "that a Jew like you asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?"  (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.10" type="verse">"If you had known God's free gift," replied Jesus, "and who it is that said to you, `Give me some water,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.11" type="verse">"Sir," she said, "you have nothing to draw with, and the  well is deep; so where can you get the living water from?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.12" type="verse">Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.13" type="verse">"Every one," replied Jesus, "who drinks any of this water will be thirsty again;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.14" type="verse">but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him will never, never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become a fountain within him of water  springing up  for  the Life of the Ages."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.15" type="verse">"Sir," said the woman, "give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw from the well."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.16" type="verse">"Go and call your husband," said Jesus; "and come back."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.17" type="verse">"I have no husband," she replied. "You rightly  say that you have no husband," said Jesus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.18" type="verse">"for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at present is not your husband. You have spoken the truth in saying that."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.19" type="verse">"Sir," replied the woman, "I see that you are a Prophet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.20" type="verse">Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.21" type="verse">"Believe me," said Jesus, "the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.22" type="verse">You worship  One of whom you know nothing. We worship One whom we know; for salvation comes from the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.23" type="verse">But a time is coming--nay, has already come--when the true worshippers will worship the Father  with true spiritual worship; for indeed the Father desires  such worshippers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.24" type="verse">God is  Spirit; and those who worship Him must bring Him true spiritual worship."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.25" type="verse">"I know," replied the woman, "that Messiah is coming--`the  Christ,' as He is called. When He has come, He will tell us everything."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.26" type="verse">"I am He," said Jesus--"I who am now talking to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.27" type="verse">Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet not one of them asked Him, "What is your wish?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.28" type="verse">The woman however, leaving her  pitcher, went away to the town, and called the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.29" type="verse">"Come," she said, "and see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Can this be the Christ, do you think?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.30" type="verse">They left the town and  set out to go to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.31" type="verse">Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus. "Rabbi," they said, "eat something."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.32" type="verse">"I have food to eat," He replied, "of which you do not know."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.33" type="verse">So the disciples began questioning one another. "Can it be," they said, "that some one has brought Him something to eat?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.34" type="verse">"My food," said Jesus, "is to be obedient to Him who sent me, and fully to accomplish His work.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.35" type="verse">Do you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest'? But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains--  they are already ripe for the sickle.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.36" type="verse">The reaper gets pay and gathers in a crop in preparation  for the Life of the Ages, that so the sower and the reapers may rejoice together.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.4.38" type="verse">I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labours. Others have laboured, and you are getting benefit from their labours."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.39" type="verse">Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared, "He has told me all that I have ever done."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.40" type="verse">When however the Samaritans came to Him, they  asked Him on all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.41" type="verse">Then a far larger number of people believed because of His own words,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.42" type="verse">and they said to the woman, "We no longer believe in Him simply because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.43" type="verse">After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.44" type="verse">though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour in his own country.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.45" type="verse">When  however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been to the Festival.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.46" type="verse">So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain officer of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.4.49" type="verse">"Sir," pleaded the officer, "come down before my child dies."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.50" type="verse">"You may return home," replied Jesus; "your son has recovered." He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.4.53" type="verse">Then the father recollected that that was the time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son has recovered," and he and his whole household became believers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.4.54" type="verse">This is  the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming from Judaea into Galilee.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.5.7" type="verse">"Sir," replied the sufferer, "I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is moved; but while I am coming some one else steps down before me."</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.5.9" type="verse">Instantly the man was restored to perfect health, and he took up his mat and began to walk.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.5.10" type="verse">That day was a Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, "It is the Sabbath: you must not carry your mat."</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.5.37" type="verse">And the Father who sent me, *He* has given testimony concerning me. None of you have ever either heard His voice or seen what He is like.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.6.1" type="verse">After this Jesus went away across the Lake of Galilee (that is, the Lake of Tiberias).</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.2" type="verse">A vast multitude followed Him, because they witnessed the miracles on the sick which He was constantly performing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.3" type="verse">Then Jesus went up the hill, and sat there with His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.4" type="verse">The Jewish Festival, the Passover, was at hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.5" type="verse">And when He looked round and saw an immense crowd coming towards Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for all these people to eat?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.6" type="verse">He said this to put Philip to the test, for He Himself knew what He was going to do.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.7" type="verse">"Seven pounds' worth of bread," replied Philip, "is not enough for them all to get even a scanty meal."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.8" type="verse">One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.9" type="verse">"There is a boy here with five barley  loaves and a couple of fish: but what is that among so many?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.10" type="verse">"Make the people sit down," said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men numbering about 5,000.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.11" type="verse">Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were resting on the ground; and also the fish in like manner--as much as they desired.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.12" type="verse">When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that nothing be lost."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.13" type="verse">Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments of the five barley loaves--the broken portions that remained over after they had done eating--they filled twelve baskets.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.14" type="verse">Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed, said, "This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.15" type="verse">Perceiving,  however, that they were about to come and carry Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up the hill alone by Himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.16" type="verse">When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.17" type="verse">There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross the Lake to Capernaum. By this time it had become dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.18" type="verse">The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.19" type="verse">When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.20" type="verse">They were terrified; but He called to them. "It is I," He said, "do not be afraid."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.21" type="verse">Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.22" type="verse">Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went away without Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.23" type="verse">Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.24" type="verse">When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.25" type="verse">So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him, they asked Him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.26" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that you are searching for me not because you have seen miracles, but because you ate  the loaves and had a hearty meal.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.27" type="verse">Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes, but on the food that remains unto  the Life of the Ages--that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you; for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.28" type="verse">"What are we to do," they asked, "in order to carry out the things that God requires?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.29" type="verse">"This," replied Jesus, "is above all the thing that God requires--that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.30" type="verse">"What miracle then," they asked, "do you perform for us to see and become believers in you? What do you *do*?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.31" type="verse">Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written, &amp;lt;`He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.32" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you," replied Jesus, "that Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father is giving you the bread--the true bread--out of Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.33" type="verse">For God's bread is  that which comes down out of Heaven and gives Life to the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.34" type="verse">"Sir," they said, "always give us that bread."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.35" type="verse">"I am the bread of Life," replied Jesus; "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.36" type="verse">But  it is as I have said to you: you have seen  me and yet you do not believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.37" type="verse">Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.38" type="verse">For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek my own  pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.39" type="verse">And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of  all that He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise  it to life on the last day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.40" type="verse">For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life  of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.41" type="verse">Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.42" type="verse">They kept asking, "Is not  this man Joseph's son? Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know? What does he mean by now saying, `I have come down out of Heaven'?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.43" type="verse">"Do not  thus find fault among yourselves," replied Jesus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.44" type="verse">"no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; then I will raise him to life on the last day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.45" type="verse">It stands written in the Prophets, &amp;lt;`And they shall all of them be taught by God'.&amp;gt; Every one who  listens to the Father and learns from Him comes to me.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.6.49" type="verse">Your forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, and they died.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.50" type="verse">Here is the bread that comes down out of Heaven that a man may eat it and not die.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.51" type="verse">I am the living bread come down out of Heaven. If a man eats  this bread, he shall live for ever. Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh  given for the life of the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.52" type="verse">This led to an angry debate among the Jews. "How can  this man," they argued, "give us his flesh to eat?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.53" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus, "that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no Life  in you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.54" type="verse">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him up on the last day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.55" type="verse">For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.56" type="verse">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I remain in union with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.57" type="verse">As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live  because of the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.58" type="verse">This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike that which your forefathers ate--for they ate and yet died. He who eats this bread shall live for ever."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.59" type="verse">Jesus said all this  in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.60" type="verse">Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is hard to accept. Who can listen  to such teaching?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.61" type="verse">But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied about it, Jesus asked them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.62" type="verse">"Does this seem incredible to you? What then if you were to see the Son of Man ascending  again where He was before?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.63" type="verse">It is the spirit which gives Life. The flesh confers no benefit whatever. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and are Life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.64" type="verse">But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.65" type="verse">So He added, "That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.66" type="verse">Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away, and no longer associated with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.67" type="verse">Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve. "Will you go also?" He asked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.68" type="verse">"Master," replied Simon Peter, "to whom shall we go?  Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.69" type="verse">And we have come to believe and know that *you* are indeed the Holy One of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.70" type="verse">"Did not I choose you--the Twelve?" said Jesus, "and even of you one is  a devil."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.6.71" type="verse">He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot. For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards to betray Him.</seg>

        <div id="b.JOH.7" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.1" type="verse">After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee. He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking an opportunity to kill Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.2" type="verse">But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.3" type="verse">So His brothers said to Him, "Leave these parts and go into Judaea, that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles which you perform.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.4" type="verse">For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be himself known publicly. Since you are doing these things, show yourself openly to the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.5" type="verse">For even His brothers were not believers in Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.6" type="verse">"My time," replied Jesus, "has not yet come, but for you any time is suitable.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.7" type="verse">It is impossible for the world to hate you; but me it does hate, because I give testimony concerning it that its conduct is evil.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.8" type="verse">As for you, go up to the Festival.  I do  not now go up to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.9" type="verse">Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.10" type="verse">When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.11" type="verse">Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him and were inquiring, "Where is he?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.12" type="verse">Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate about Him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so: he is imposing on the people."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.13" type="verse">Yet  for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.14" type="verse">But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and commenced teaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.15" type="verse">The Jews were astonished. "How does  this man know anything of books," they said, "although he has never been at any of the schools?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.16" type="verse">Jesus answered their question by saying, "My teaching does not belong to me, but comes from Him who sent me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.17" type="verse">If any one is willing to do His will, he shall know about the teaching, whether it is from God or originates with me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.18" type="verse">The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory. He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth, and there is no deception in him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.19" type="verse">Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not a man of you obeys the Law. Why do you want to kill me?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.20" type="verse">"You are possessed by a demon," replied the crowd;  "no one wants to kill you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.21" type="verse">"One deed I have done," replied Jesus, "and you are all full of wonder.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.22" type="verse">Consider therefore. Moses  gave you the rite of circumcision (not that it began with Moses, but with your earlier forefathers), and even on a Sabbath day you circumcise a child.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.23" type="verse">If a child is circumcised even on a Sabbath day, are you bitter against me because I have restored a man to perfect health on a Sabbath day?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.24" type="verse">Do not form  superficial judgements, but form the judgements that are just."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.25" type="verse">Some however of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this the man they are wanting to kill?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.26" type="verse">But  here he is, speaking openly and boldly, and they say nothing to him! Can the Rulers really have ascertained that this man is the Christ?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.27" type="verse">And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from; but as for the Christ, when He comes, no one can tell where He is from."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.28" type="verse">Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud, and said, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has sent me, an Authority indeed, of whom you have no knowledge.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.29" type="verse">I know Him, because I came from Him, and He sent me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.30" type="verse">On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand was laid on Him, because His time had not yet come.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.31" type="verse">But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him. "When the Christ comes," they said, "will He perform more miracles than this teacher has performed?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.32" type="verse">The Pharisees heard the people thus expressing their various doubts about Him, and the High Priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to apprehend Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.33" type="verse">So Jesus said, "Still for a short time I am with you, and then I go my way to Him who sent me.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.7.35" type="verse">The Jews therefore said to one another, "Where is he about to betake himself,  so that we shall not find him? Will he betake himself to the Dispersion among the  Gentiles, and teach the  Gentiles?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.36" type="verse">What do those words of his mean, `You will look for me, but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.37" type="verse">On the last day of the Festival--the great day--Jesus stood up and cried aloud. "Whoever is thirsty," He said, "let him come to me and drink.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.38" type="verse">He who believes in me, from within him--as the Scripture has said--rivers of living water shall flow."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.39" type="verse">He referred to the Spirit which those who  believed in Him  were to receive; for the Spirit was not  bestowed as yet, because Jesus had not yet been  glorified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.40" type="verse">After listening to these  discourses,  some of the crowd began to say, "This is beyond doubt the Prophet."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.41" type="verse">Others said, "He is the Christ." But others again,  "Not so, for is the Christ to come from Galilee?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.42" type="verse">Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ is to come of the family of David and from Bethlehem, David's village?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.43" type="verse">So there was a violent dissension among the people on His account.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.44" type="verse">Some of them wanted at once to arrest Him, but no one laid hands upon Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.7.45" type="verse">Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.9.6" type="verse">After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then, kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay over the man's eyes and said to him,</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.9.8" type="verse">His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.9" type="verse">"Yes it is," replied some of them. "No it is not," said others, "but he is like him." His own statement was, "I am the man."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.10" type="verse">"How then were your eyes opened?" they  asked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.11" type="verse">"He whose name is Jesus," he answered, "made clay and smeared my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and  obtained sight."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.12" type="verse">"Where is he?" they inquired, but the man did not know.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.13" type="verse">They brought him to the Pharisees--the man who had been blind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.14" type="verse">Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened the man's eyes was the Sabbath.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.15" type="verse">So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had obtained his sight. "He put clay on my eyes," he replied, "and I washed, and now I can see."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.16" type="verse">This led some of the Pharisees to say,  "That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." "How is it possible for  a bad man to do such miracles?" argued others.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.17" type="verse">And there was a division among them. So again they asked the once blind man, "What is your account of him? --for he opened your eyes." "He is a Prophet," he replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.18" type="verse">The Jews,  however, did not believe the statement concerning him--that he had been blind and had obtained his sight--until they called his parents and asked them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.19" type="verse">"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it then that he can now see?"</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.9.22" type="verse">Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.23" type="verse">That was why his parents said, "He is of full age: ask him himself."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.24" type="verse">A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said, "Give God the praise: we know that that man is a sinner."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.25" type="verse">"Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know," he replied; "one thing I know--that I was once blind and that now I can see."</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.9.27" type="verse">"I have told you already," he replied, "and you did not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also mean to be disciples of his?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.28" type="verse">Then they railed at him, and said, "You are that man's disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.9.30" type="verse">"Why, this is marvellous!" the man replied; "you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes!</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.31" type="verse">We know that God does not listen to bad people, but that if any one is a God-fearing man and obeys Him, to him He listens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.32" type="verse">From the beginning of the world such a thing was never heard of as that any one should open the eyes of a man blind from his birth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.33" type="verse">Had that man not come from God, he could have done nothing."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.34" type="verse">"You," they replied, "were wholly begotten and born in sin, and do *you* teach *us*?" And they put him out of the synagogue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.35" type="verse">Jesus heard that they had done this. So having found him, He asked him, "Do you believe in the  Son of God?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.36" type="verse">"Who is He, Sir?" replied the man. "Tell me, so that I may believe in Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.37" type="verse">"You have seen Him," said Jesus; "and not only so: He is now speaking to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.38" type="verse">"I believe, Sir," he said. And he threw himself at His feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.39" type="verse">"I came into this world," said Jesus, "to judge men, that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see may become blind."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.40" type="verse">These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present, and they asked Him, "Are *we* also blind?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.9.41" type="verse">"If you were blind," answered Jesus, "you would have no sin; but as a matter of fact you boast that you see. So your sin remains!"</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.10.33" type="verse">"For no good deed," the Jews replied, "are we going to stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.34" type="verse">"Does it not stand written in your Law," replied Jesus, &amp;lt;"`I said, you are gods'?&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.35" type="verse">If those to whom God's word was addressed  are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.36" type="verse">how is it that you say to one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am God's Son'?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.37" type="verse">If the deeds I do are not my Father's deeds, do not believe me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.38" type="verse">But if they are, then even if you do not believe me, at least believe the deeds, that you may know and see clearly that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.39" type="verse">This made them once more try to arrest Him, but He withdrew out of their  power.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.40" type="verse">Then He went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first; and there He stayed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.41" type="verse">Large numbers of people also came to Him. Their report was, "John did not work any miracle, but all that John said about this Teacher was true."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.10.42" type="verse">And many  became believers in Him there.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.JOH.11" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.1" type="verse">Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill--  Bethany being the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.2" type="verse">(It was the Mary who poured the perfume over the Lord and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.3" type="verse">So the sisters sent to Him to say, "Master, he  whom you hold dear is ill."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.4" type="verse">Jesus received the message and said, "This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.5" type="verse">Now Jesus  loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.6" type="verse">When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained two days in that same place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.7" type="verse">Then, after that, He said to the disciples, "Let us return to Judaea."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.8" type="verse">"Rabbi," exclaimed the disciples, "the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.9" type="verse">"Are there not twelve hours in the day?" replied Jesus. "If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble--because he sees  the light of this world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.10" type="verse">But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.11" type="verse">He said this, and afterwards He added, "Our  friend Lazarus  is sleeping, but I will go  and wake him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.12" type="verse">"Master," said the disciples, "if he is asleep he will recover."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.13" type="verse">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He referred to the rest taken in ordinary sleep.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.14" type="verse">So then He told them plainly,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.15" type="verse">"Lazarus  is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.16" type="verse">"Let us go also," Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "that we may die with him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.17" type="verse">On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been  three days in the tomb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.18" type="verse">Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less than two miles;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.19" type="verse">and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy with them on the death of their brother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.20" type="verse">Martha,  however, as soon as she heard the tidings, "Jesus is coming," went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.21" type="verse">So Martha came and spoke to Jesus. "Master, if you had been here," she said, "my brother would not have died.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.22" type="verse">And  even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.23" type="verse">"Your brother  shall rise again," replied Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.24" type="verse">"I know," said Martha, "that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.25" type="verse">"I am the Resurrection and the Life," said Jesus; "he who believes in me, even if he  has died, he shall live;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.26" type="verse">and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.27" type="verse">"Yes, Master," she replied; "I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.28" type="verse">After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, "The  Rabbi is here and is asking for you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.29" type="verse">So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.30" type="verse">Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.31" type="verse">So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her,  supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.32" type="verse">Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, "Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.33" type="verse">Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus,  curbing the strong  emotion of His spirit,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.34" type="verse">though deeply troubled, asked them, "Where have you laid him?" "Master, come and see," was their reply.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.35" type="verse">Jesus  wept.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.36" type="verse">"See how dear he held him," said the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.37" type="verse">But others of them asked, "Was this man who opened the blind man's eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.38" type="verse">Jesus, however, again  restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.39" type="verse">"Take away the stone," said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, "Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for  it is three days since he died."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.40" type="verse">"Did I not promise you," replied Jesus, "that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.41" type="verse">So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.42" type="verse">I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd standing round I have said this--that they may believe that Thou didst send me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.43" type="verse">After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.44" type="verse">The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in  cloths, and his face wrapped round with a  towel. "Untie him," said Jesus, "and let him go free."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.45" type="verse">Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews--namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds--became believers in Him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.46" type="verse">though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.47" type="verse">Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What steps are we taking?" they asked one another; "for this man is performing a great number of miracles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.48" type="verse">If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our  city and our nation."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.49" type="verse">But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, "You know nothing about it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.50" type="verse">You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.51" type="verse">It was not  as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.52" type="verse">and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one body all the far-scattered children of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.53" type="verse">So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.54" type="verse">Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.55" type="verse">The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many  from that district went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.56" type="verse">They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think? --will he come to the Festival at all?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.11.57" type="verse">Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.JOH.12" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.1" type="verse">Jesus,  however, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom He had raised from the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.2" type="verse">So they gave a dinner there in honour of Jesus, at which Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of the guests who were with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.3" type="verse">Availing herself of the opportunity, Mary took a pound weight of  pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over His feet, and wiped His feet with her hair, so that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.4" type="verse">Then said Judas (the Iscariot, one of the Twelve--the one who afterwards betrayed Jesus),</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.5" type="verse">"Why was not that perfume sold for 300 shillings and the money given to the poor?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.6" type="verse">The reason he said this was not that he cared for the poor, but that he was a thief, and that being in charge of the  money-box, he used to steal what was put into it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.7" type="verse">But Jesus interposed. "Do not blame her," He said,  "allow her to have kept it for the time of my preparation for burial.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.8" type="verse">For the poor you always have with you, but you have not me always."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.9" type="verse">Now it became widely known among the Jews that Jesus was there; but they came not only on His account, but also in order to see Lazarus whom He had brought back to life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.10" type="verse">The High Priests, however, consulted together to put Lazarus also to death,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.11" type="verse">for because of him many of the Jews  left them and became believers in Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.12" type="verse">The next day a great crowd of those who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.13" type="verse">took branches of  the palm trees and went out to meet Him, shouting as they went, "God save him! &amp;lt;Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord&amp;gt;--even on the King of Israel!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.14" type="verse">And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.15" type="verse">&amp;lt;"Fear not,  Daughter of Zion! See, thy King is coming riding on an ass's colt."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.16" type="verse">The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time; but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this was written about Him, and that they had done this to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.17" type="verse">The large number of people,  however, who had been present when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life, related what they had witnessed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.18" type="verse">This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they had heard of His having performed that miracle.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.19" type="verse">The result was that the Pharisees said among themselves,  "Observe how idle all your efforts are! The world is gone after him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.20" type="verse">Now some of those who used  to come up to worship at the Festival were Greeks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.21" type="verse">They came to Philip, of Bethsaida in Galilee, with the request, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.22" type="verse">Philip came and told Andrew: Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.23" type="verse">His answer was, "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.24" type="verse">In most solemn truth I tell you that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains what it was--a single grain; but that if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.25" type="verse">He who holds  his life dear, is destroying it; and he who  makes his life of no account in this world  shall keep it to the Life  of the Ages.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.26" type="verse">If a man wishes to be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there too shall my servant be. If a man wishes to be my servant, the Father will honour him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.27" type="verse">Now is my soul full of trouble; and what shall I say? Father,  save me from this hour. But  for this purpose I have come to this hour.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.28" type="verse">Father, glorify Thy name." Thereupon there came a voice from the sky, "I have glorified it and will also glorify it again."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.29" type="verse">The crowd that  stood by and heard it, said that there had been thunder. Others said, "An angel spoke to him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.30" type="verse">"It is not for my sake," said Jesus, "that that voice came, but for your sakes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.31" type="verse">Now  is a judgement of this world: now will the Prince of this world be driven out.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.32" type="verse">And I--  if I am lifted up  from the earth--will draw all men to me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.33" type="verse">He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.34" type="verse">The crowd answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains for ever. In what sense do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is that Son of Man?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.35" type="verse">"Yet a little while," He replied, "the light is among you.  Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness should  overtake you; for a man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.36" type="verse">In the degree that you have light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." Jesus said this, and went away and  hid Himself from them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.37" type="verse">But though He had performed  such great miracles in their presence, they did not believe in Him--</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.38" type="verse">in order that the words of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, &amp;lt;"Lord, who has believed our preaching? And the arm of the Lord--to whom has it been unveiled?"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.39" type="verse">For this reason they were unable to believe--because Isaiah said again,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.40" type="verse">&amp;lt;"He has blinded their eyes and made their minds callous, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their minds, and should turn, and I should heal them."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.41" type="verse">Isaiah uttered these words because he saw His glory; and he spoke of Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.42" type="verse">Nevertheless even from among the Rulers many believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not avow their belief, for fear they should be shut out from the synagogue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.43" type="verse">For they loved the glory that comes from men rather than the glory that comes from God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.44" type="verse">But Jesus  cried aloud, "He who believes in me, believes not so much in me, as in Him who sent me;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.45" type="verse">and he who sees me sees Him who sent me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.12.46" type="verse">I have come like light into the world, in order that no one who believes in me may remain in the dark.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.12.49" type="verse">Because I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me, Himself  gave me a command what to say and in what words to speak.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.13.1" type="verse">Now just before the Feast of the Passover this incident took place. Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world and go to the Father; and having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them  to the end.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.2" type="verse">While supper was proceeding, the Devil having by this time suggested to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, the thought of betraying Him, Jesus,</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.13.5" type="verse">Then He poured water into a basin, and proceeded to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel which He had put round Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.13.10" type="verse">"Any one who has lately bathed," said Jesus, "does not need to wash  more than his feet, but is clean all over. And you my disciples are clean, and yet this is not true of all of you."</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.13.21" type="verse">After speaking thus Jesus was troubled in spirit and said with deep earnestness, "In most solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.22" type="verse">The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know to which of them He was referring.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.23" type="verse">There was at table one of His disciples--the one Jesus  loved--  reclining with his head on Jesus's bosom.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.24" type="verse">Making a sign therefore to him, Simon Peter said, "Tell us to whom he is referring."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.25" type="verse">So he, having his head on Jesus's bosom, leaned back and asked, "Master, who is it?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.26" type="verse">"It is the one," answered Jesus, "for whom I shall  dip this piece of bread and to whom I shall give it." Accordingly He dipped the piece of bread, and took it and gave it to Judas, the son of the Iscariot Simon.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.27" type="verse">Then, after Judas had received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. "Lose no time  about it," said Jesus to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.28" type="verse">But why He said this no one else at the table understood.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.29" type="verse">Some,  however, supposed that because Judas had the money-box Jesus meant, "Buy what we require for the Festival," or that he should give something to the poor.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.30" type="verse">So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went out. And it was night.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.31" type="verse">So when he was gone out, Jesus said, "Now  is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.32" type="verse">Moreover God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him without delay.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.33" type="verse">Dear children, I am still with you a little longer. You will seek me, but, as I said to the Jews, `Where I am going you cannot come,' so for the present I say to you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JOH.13.36" type="verse">"Master," inquired Simon Peter, "where are you going?" "Where I am going," replied Jesus, "you cannot be my follower now, but you shall be later."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.37" type="verse">"Master," asked Peter again, "why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my  life on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.13.38" type="verse">"You say you will lay down your life on my behalf!" said Jesus; "in most solemn truth I tell you that  the cock will not crow before you have three times disowned me."</seg>

        <div id="b.JOH.18" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.1" type="verse">After offering this prayer Jesus went out with His disciples to a place on the further side of the Ravine of the Cedars, where there was a garden which He entered--Himself and His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.2" type="verse">Now Judas also, who at that very time was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often resorted there with His disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.3" type="verse">So Judas,  followed by the battalion and by a detachment of the Temple police sent by the High Priests and Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.4" type="verse">Jesus therefore, knowing all that was about to befall Him, went out to meet them.  "Who are you looking for?" He asked them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.5" type="verse">"For Jesus the Nazarene," was the answer. "I am he," He replied. (Now Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.6" type="verse">As soon then as He said to them, "I am he," they went backwards and  fell to the ground.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.7" type="verse">Again therefore He asked them,  "Who are you looking for?" "For Jesus the Nazarene," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.8" type="verse">"I have told you," replied Jesus, "that I am he. If therefore you are looking for me, let these my disciples go their way."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.9" type="verse">He made this request in order that the words He had spoken might be fulfilled, "As for those whom Thou hast given me, I have not lost one."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.10" type="verse">Simon Peter, however, having a sword, drew it, and, aiming at the High Priest's  servant, cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.11" type="verse">Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put back your sword. Shall I refuse to drink the cup of sorrow which the Father has given me to drink?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.12" type="verse">So the battalion and their  tribune and the Jewish police closed in, and took Jesus and bound Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.13" type="verse">They then brought Him to  Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.14" type="verse">(It was this Caiaphas who had advised the Jews, saying, "It is to your interest that one man should die for the People.")</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.15" type="verse">Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so also was another disciple. The latter was known to the High Priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest's palace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.16" type="verse">But Peter remained standing outside the door, till the disciple who was acquainted with the High Priest came out and induced the portress to let Peter in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.17" type="verse">This led the girl, the portress, to ask Peter, "Are you also one of this man's disciples?" "No, I am not," he replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.18" type="verse">Now because it was cold the  servants and the police had lighted a  charcoal fire, and were standing and warming themselves; and Peter too remained with them, standing and warming himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.19" type="verse">So the High Priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.20" type="verse">"As for me," replied Jesus,  "I have spoken  openly to the world. I  have continually taught in some synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.21" type="verse">Why do you question me? Question  those who heard what it was I said to them: these witnesses here know what I said."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.22" type="verse">Upon His saying this, one of the officers standing by struck Him  with his open hand, asking Him as he did so, "Is that the way you answer the High Priest?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.23" type="verse">"If I have spoken wrongly," replied Jesus, "bear witness to it as wrong; but if rightly, why that blow?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.24" type="verse">So Annas  sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.25" type="verse">But Simon Peter remained standing and  warming himself, and this led to their asking him, "Are you also one of his disciples?" He denied it, and said, "No, I am not."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.26" type="verse">One of the High Priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.27" type="verse">Once more Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.28" type="verse">So they brought Jesus from Caiaphas's house to the  Praetorium. It was the early morning, and they would not enter the Praetorium themselves for fear of defilement, and in order that they might be able to eat the Passover.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.29" type="verse">Accordingly Pilate  came out to them and inquired, "What accusation have you to bring against this man?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.30" type="verse">"If the man were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.31" type="verse">"Take him yourselves," said Pilate, "and judge him by your Law." "We have no power," replied the Jews, "to put any man to death."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.32" type="verse">They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus predicted the kind of death He was to die.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.33" type="verse">Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus and asked Him, "Are *you* the King of the Jews?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.34" type="verse">"Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you about me?" replied Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.35" type="verse">"Am I a Jew?" exclaimed Pilate; "it is your own nation and the High Priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.36" type="verse">"My kingdom," replied Jesus, "does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects  would have resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews. But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.37" type="verse">"So then *you* are a king!" rejoined Pilate. "Yes," said Jesus, "you say truly that I am a king. For this purpose  I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world--to give testimony for the truth. Every one who is  a friend of the truth listens to my voice."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.38" type="verse">"What is truth?" said Pilate. But no sooner had he spoken the words than he went out again to the Jews and told them, "I find no crime in him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.39" type="verse">But you have a custom that I should release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So shall I release to you the King of the Jews?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.18.40" type="verse">With a roar of voices they again cried out, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.JOH.19" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.1" type="verse">Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.2" type="verse">And the soldiers, twisting twigs of thorn into a wreath, put it on His head, and threw round Him a crimson cloak.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.3" type="verse">Then they began to march up to Him, saying in a mocking voice, "Hail King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with the palms of their hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.4" type="verse">Once more Pilate  came out and said to the Jews, "See, I am bringing him out to you to let you clearly understand that I find no crime in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.5" type="verse">So Jesus came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the crimson cloak. And Pilate said to them, "See, there is the man."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.6" type="verse">As soon then as the High Priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted "To the cross! To the cross!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him," said Pilate; "for I, at any rate, find no crime in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.7" type="verse">"We," replied the Jews, "have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.8" type="verse">More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.9" type="verse">"What is your origin?" he asked. But Jesus gave him no answer.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.10" type="verse">"Do you refuse to speak even to me?" asked Pilate; "do you not know that I have it in my power either to release you or to crucify you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.11" type="verse">"You would have had no power whatever over me," replied Jesus, "had it not been granted you from above. On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more guilty than you are."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.12" type="verse">Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him. But the Jews  kept shouting, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar's. Every one who sets himself up as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.13" type="verse">On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out, and  sat down on the judge's seat in a place called the Pavement--or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.14" type="verse">It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about  six o'clock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "There is your king!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.15" type="verse">This caused a storm of outcries, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!" "Am I to crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king, except Caesar," answered the High Priests.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.16" type="verse">Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified. Accordingly they took Jesus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.17" type="verse">and He went out carrying His own cross, to the place called Skull-place--or, in Hebrew, Golgotha--</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.18" type="verse">where they nailed Him to a cross, and two others at the same time, one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.19" type="verse">And Pilate wrote a notice and had it fastened to the top of the cross. It ran thus: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.20" type="verse">Many of the Jews read this notice, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was in three languages--Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.21" type="verse">This led the Jewish High Priests to remonstrate with Pilate. "You should not write `The King of the Jews,'" they said, "but that he claimed to be King of the Jews."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.22" type="verse">"What I have written I have written," was Pilate's answer.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.23" type="verse">So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, including His  tunic, and divided them into four parts--one part for each soldier. The tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.24" type="verse">So they said to one another, "Do not let us tear it. Let us draw lots for it." This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, &amp;lt;"They shared my garments among them, and drew lots for my clothing."&amp;gt; That was just what the soldiers did.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.25" type="verse">Now standing close to the cross of Jesus were His mother and His mother's sister,  Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.26" type="verse">So Jesus, seeing His mother, and seeing the disciple whom He loved standing near, said to His mother,  "Behold, your son!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.27" type="verse">Then He said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that time the disciple received her into his own home.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.28" type="verse">After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now brought to an end, said--that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "I am thirsty."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.29" type="verse">There was a jar of  wine standing there. With this wine they filled a sponge, put it on the end of a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.30" type="verse">As soon as Jesus had taken the wine, He said, "It is finished." And then, bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.31" type="verse">Meanwhile the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain on the crosses during  the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was one of special solemnity), requested Pilate to have the legs of the dying men broken, and the bodies removed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.32" type="verse">Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and also of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.33" type="verse">Then they came to Jesus Himself: but when they saw that He was already dead, they refrained from breaking His legs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.34" type="verse">One of the soldiers, however, made a thrust at His side with a lance, and immediately  blood and water flowed out.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.35" type="verse">This statement is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true. He knows that he is telling the truth--in order that you also may believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.36" type="verse">For all this took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled which declares, &amp;lt;"Not one of His bones shall be broken."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.37" type="verse">And again another Scripture says, &amp;lt;"They shall look on Him whom they have pierced."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.38" type="verse">After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but for fear of the Jews a secret disciple, asked Pilate's permission to carry away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and removed the body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.39" type="verse">Nicodemus too--he who at first had visited Jesus by night--came bringing a  mixture of myrrh and aloes, in weight about  seventy or eighty pounds.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.40" type="verse">Taking down the body they wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, in accordance with the Jewish mode of preparing for burial.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.41" type="verse">There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.19.42" type="verse">Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation for the Jewish Passover, and the tomb was close at hand, they put Jesus there.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.JOH.20" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.1" type="verse">On the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been  removed from it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.2" type="verse">So she ran, as fast as she could, to find Simon Peter and the other disciple--the one who was dear to Jesus--and to tell them, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.3" type="verse">Peter and the other disciple started at once to go to the tomb, both of them running,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.4" type="verse">but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached it before he did.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.5" type="verse">Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying there on the ground, but he did not go in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.6" type="verse">Simon Peter, however, also came, following him, and entered the tomb. There on the ground he saw the cloths;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.7" type="verse">and the  towel, which had been placed  over the face of Jesus, not lying with the cloths, but folded up and put by itself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.8" type="verse">Then the other disciple, who had been the first to come to the tomb, also went in and saw and was convinced.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.9" type="verse">For until now they had not understood the inspired teaching, that He must rise again from among the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.10" type="verse">Then they went away and returned home.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.11" type="verse">Meanwhile Mary remained standing near the tomb, weeping aloud. She did not enter the tomb, but as she wept she stooped and looked in,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.12" type="verse">and  saw two angels clothed in white raiment, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.13" type="verse">They spoke to her.  "Why are you weeping?" they asked. "Because," she replied, "they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.14" type="verse">While she was speaking, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.15" type="verse">"Why are you weeping?" He asked;  "who are you looking for?" She, supposing that He was the gardener, replied, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will remove him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.16" type="verse">"Mary!" said Jesus. She turned to Him.  "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew: the word means `Teacher!'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.17" type="verse">"Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I have not yet ascended to the Father.  But take this message to my brethren: `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.18" type="verse">Mary of Magdala came and brought word to the disciples. "I have seen the Master," she said. And she told them that He had said these things to her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.19" type="verse">On that same first day of the week, when it was evening and, for fear of the Jews, the doors of the house where the disciples were, were locked, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.20" type="verse">Having said this He showed them His hands and also His side; and the disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Master.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.21" type="verse">A second time, therefore,  He said to them, "Peace be to you! As the Father sent me, I also now send you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.22" type="verse">Having said this He breathed upon them and said, "Receive  the Holy Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.23" type="verse">If you remit the sins of any persons, they  remain remitted to them. If you bind fast the sins of any, they remain bound."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.24" type="verse">Thomas, one of the twelve--surnamed `the Twin' --was not among them when Jesus came.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.25" type="verse">So the rest of the disciples told him, "We have seen the Master!" His reply was, "Unless I see in his hands the wound made by the nails and put my  finger into the wound, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.26" type="verse">A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them, when Jesus came--though the doors were locked--and stood in their midst, and said, "Peace be to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.27" type="verse">Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here and  feel my hands; bring you hand and put it into my side; and do not be ready to disbelieve but to believe."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.28" type="verse">"My Lord and my God!" replied Thomas.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.29" type="verse">"Because you have seen me," replied Jesus, "you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.30" type="verse">There were also a great number of other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.20.31" type="verse">But these have been recorded in order that you may believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, through believing, you may have Life through His name.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.JOH.21" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.1" type="verse">After this, Jesus again showed Himself to the disciples. It was at the Lake of Tiberias. The circumstances were as follows.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.2" type="verse">Simon Peter was with Thomas, called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zabdi, and two others of the Master's disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.3" type="verse">Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." "We will go too," said they. So they set out and went on board their boat; but they caught nothing that night.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.4" type="verse">When, however, day was now dawning, Jesus stood on the beach, though the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.5" type="verse">He called to them. "Children," He said, "have you any food there?" "No," they answered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.6" type="verse">"Throw the net in on the right hand side," He said, "and you will find fish." So they threw the net in, and now they could scarcely drag it along for the quantity of fish.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.7" type="verse">This made the disciple whom Jesus  loved say to Peter, "It is the Master." Simon Peter therefore, when he heard the words, "It is the Master," drew on his  fisherman's shirt--for  he had not been wearing it--put on his girdle, and sprang into the water.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.8" type="verse">But the rest of the disciples came in the  small boat (for they were not far from land--only about a hundred yards off), dragging the net full of fish.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.9" type="verse">As soon as they landed, they saw a charcoal fire burning there, with fish broiling on it, and bread close by.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.10" type="verse">Jesus told them to fetch some of the fish which they had just caught.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.11" type="verse">So Simon Peter went on board  the boat and drew the net ashore full of large fish, 153 in number; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not broken.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.12" type="verse">"Come this way and have breakfast," said Jesus. But not one of the disciples ventured to question Him as to who He was, for they felt sure that it was the Master.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.13" type="verse">Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave them some, and the fish in the same way.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.14" type="verse">This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed Himself to the disciples after He had risen from among the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.15" type="verse">When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you  love me  more than these others do?" "Yes, Master," was his answer; "you know that you  are dear to me."  "Then feed my lambs," replied Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.16" type="verse">Again a second time He asked him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" "Yes, Master," he said, "you know that you are dear to me." "Then be a shepherd to my sheep," He said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.17" type="verse">A third time Jesus put the question: "Simon, son of John, am I dear to you?" It grieved Peter that Jesus asked him the third time, "Am I dear to you?" "Master," he replied, "you know everything, you can see that you are dear to me." "Then feed my  much-loved sheep," said Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.18" type="verse">"In most solemn truth I tell you that whereas, when you were young, you used to put on your girdle and walk whichever way you chose, when you have grown old you will stretch out your arms and  some one else will put  a girdle round you and  carry you where you have no wish to go."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.19" type="verse">This He said to indicate the kind of death by which that disciple would bring glory to God; and after speaking thus He said to him, "Follow me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.20" type="verse">Peter turned round and noticed the disciple whom Jesus loved following--the one who at the supper had leaned back on His breast and had asked, "Master, who is it that is betraying you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.21" type="verse">On seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, "And, Master, what about him?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.22" type="verse">"If I desire him to remain  till I come," replied Jesus, "what concern is that of yours? You, yourself, must follow me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.23" type="verse">Hence the report spread among the brethren that that disciple would never die. Yet Jesus did not say, "He is not to die," but, "If I desire him to remain till I come,  what concern is that of yours?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.24" type="verse">That is the disciple who gives his testimony as to these matters, and has written this history; and we know that his testimony is true.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JOH.21.25" type="verse">But there are also many other things which Jesus did--so vast a number indeed that if they were all described in detail, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.1.3" type="verse">He had also, after He suffered,  shown Himself alive to them with many sure  proofs,  appearing to them at intervals during forty days, and speaking of the Kingdom of God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.1.9" type="verse">When He had said this, and while they were looking at Him, He was carried up, and a cloud closing beneath Him hid Him from their sight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.10" type="verse">But, while they stood intently gazing into the sky as He went, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,</seg>

Their names were Peter and  John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.14" type="verse">All of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.15" type="verse">It was on one of these days that Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren--the entire number of persons present being about 120--and said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.16" type="verse">"Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled--the prediction, I mean, which the Holy Spirit uttered by the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.17" type="verse">For Judas was reckoned as one of our number, and  a share in this ministry was allotted to him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.18" type="verse">(Now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his wickedness he fell there with his face downwards, and, his body bursting open, he became disembowelled.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.19" type="verse">This fact became widely known to the people of Jerusalem, so that the place received the name, in their language, of Achel-damach, which means `The Field of Blood.')</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.20" type="verse">"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, &amp;lt;"`Let his  encampment be desolate: let there be no one to dwell there';&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;"`His  work let another take up.'&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.1.21" type="verse">"It is necessary, therefore, that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.2.9" type="verse">Some of us are  Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are  inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or  the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.2.10" type="verse">of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome--being either Jews or converts from heathenism--and others are Cretans or Arabians.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.4.12" type="verse">And in no other is  the great salvation to be found; for, in fact, there is no second name under Heaven that has been given among men through which we are to be saved."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.13" type="verse">As they looked on  Peter and John so fearlessly outspoken--and also discovered that they were illiterate persons, untrained in the schools--they were surprised; and  now they recognized them as having been with Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.14" type="verse">And seeing the man standing with them--the man who had been cured--they had no reply to make.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.15" type="verse">So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin while they conferred among themselves.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.16" type="verse">"What are we to do with these men?" they asked one another; for the fact that a remarkable  miracle has been performed  by them is well known to every one in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.17" type="verse">But to prevent  the matter spreading any further among the people, let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future  in this name to any one whatever."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.18" type="verse">So they recalled the Apostles, and ordered them altogether to give up  speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.19" type="verse">But Peter and John replied,  "Judge whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you instead of listening to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.20" type="verse">As for us, what we have seen and heard we cannot help speaking about."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.21" type="verse">The Court added further threats and then let them go, being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account of the people, because all gave God the glory for the thing that had happened.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.22" type="verse">For the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle of restoration to health had been performed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.23" type="verse">After their release the two Apostles went to their friends, and told them all that the High Priests and Elders had said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.24" type="verse">And they, upon hearing the story,  all lifted up their voices to God and said, "O Sovereign Lord, it is Thou who didst make Heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.25" type="verse">and didst say  through the Holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather David Thy  servant, &amp;lt;"`Why have the nations  stamped and raged, and the peoples formed futile plans?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.26" type="verse">The  kings of the  earth came near, and the rulers assembled together against the Lord and against His Anointed.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.27" type="verse">"They did indeed assemble  in this city in hostility to Thy holy Servant Jesus whom Thou hadst anointed--Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and also the  tribes of Israel--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.28" type="verse">to do all that Thy  power and Thy will had predetermined should be done.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.29" type="verse">And now, Lord,  listen to their threats, and enable Thy servants to proclaim Thy Message with fearless courage,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.30" type="verse">whilst Thou stretchest out Thine arm to cure men, and to give signs and marvels through the name of Thy holy Servant Jesus."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.31" type="verse">When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were, one and all, filled with the Holy Spirit, and proceeded to tell God's Message with boldness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.32" type="verse">Among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart and soul, so that none of them claimed any of his possessions as his own, but everything they had was common property;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.33" type="verse">while the Apostles with great force of conviction delivered their testimony as to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.34" type="verse">And, in fact, there was not a needy man among them, for  all who were possessors of lands or houses  sold them, and  brought the money which they realised,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.35" type="verse">and  gave it to the Apostles, and distribution was made to every one according to his wants.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.36" type="verse">In this way Joseph, whom the Apostles gave the name of Bar-nabas--signifying `Son of  Encouragement' --a Levite,  a native of Cyprus,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.4.37" type="verse">sold  a farm which he had, and brought the money and  gave it to the Apostles.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.5" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.1" type="verse">There was a man of the name of  Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property but,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.2" type="verse">with her full knowledge and consent,  dishonestly kept back part of the price which he received for it, though he brought the rest and gave it to the Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.3" type="verse">"Ananias," said Peter, "why  has Satan taken possession of your heart, that you should try to deceive the Holy Spirit and dishonestly keep back part of the price paid you for this land?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.4" type="verse">While it remained unsold, was not the land your own? And when sold, was it not at your own disposal? How is it that you have  cherished this design in your heart?  It is not to men you have told this lie, but to God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.5" type="verse">Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down dead, and all who heard the words were awe-struck.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.6" type="verse">The younger men, however, rose, and wrapping the body up, carried it out and buried it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.7" type="verse">About three hours had passed, when his wife came in, knowing nothing of what had happened.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.8" type="verse">Peter at once  questioned her. "Tell me," he said, "whether you sold the land for so much." "Yes," she replied, "for so much."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.9" type="verse">"How was it," replied Peter, "that you two agreed  to try an experiment upon the Spirit of the Lord?  The men who have buried your husband are already at the door, and they will carry you out."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.10" type="verse">Instantly she fell down dead at his feet, and the young men  came in and found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her by her husband's side.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.11" type="verse">This incident struck terror into the whole Church, and into the hearts of all who heard of it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.12" type="verse">Many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people by the Apostles; and by common consent they all met in Solomon's Portico.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.13" type="verse">But  none of the others dared to attach themselves to them. Yet the people held them in high honour--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.14" type="verse">and more and more believers in the Lord joined them, including great numbers both of men and women--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.15" type="verse">so that they  would even bring out  their sick friends into the streets and lay them on light couches or mats, in order that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on one or other of them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.16" type="verse">The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem  came in crowds, bringing sick persons and some who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured, one and all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.17" type="verse">This roused the High Priest. He and all his party--the sect of the Sadducees--were filled with angry jealousy</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.18" type="verse">and laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them into the public jail.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.19" type="verse">But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.20" type="verse">"Go and stand in the Temple, and go on proclaiming to the people all  this Message of Life."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.21" type="verse">Having received that command they went into the Temple, just before daybreak, and began to teach: So when the High Priest and his party came, and had called together the Sanhedrin as well as all the  Elders of the  descendants of Israel, they sent to the jail to fetch the Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.22" type="verse">But the officers went and could not find them in the prison. So they came back and brought word,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.23" type="verse">saying, "The jail we found quite safely locked, and the warders were on guard at the doors, but  upon going in we found no one there."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.24" type="verse">When the Commander of the Temple Guards and the High Priests heard this statement, they were utterly at a loss with regard to it, wondering what would happen next.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.25" type="verse">And some one came and brought them word, saying,  "The men you put in prison are actually in the Temple, standing there, teaching the people."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.26" type="verse">Upon this the Commander went with the officers, and brought the Apostles; but without using violence; for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.27" type="verse">So they brought them and made them stand  in front of the Sanhedrin. And then the High Priest questioned them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.28" type="verse">"We strictly forbad you to teach in that name--did we not?" he said. "And see, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are trying to make us responsible for that man's death!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.29" type="verse">Peter and the other Apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than man.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.30" type="verse">The God of our forefathers has  raised Jesus to life, whom you crucified and put to death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.31" type="verse">God has exalted Him  to His right hand as Chief Leader and as Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.32" type="verse">And we--and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him--are witnesses as to these things."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.33" type="verse">Infuriated at getting this answer, they  were disposed to kill the Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.34" type="verse">But a Pharisee of the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, held in honour by all the people, rose from his seat and requested that  they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.35" type="verse">"Israelites," he said, "be careful what you are about to do in dealing with these men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.36" type="verse">Years ago Theudas appeared, professing to be a person of importance, and a body of men, some four hundred in number, joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.37" type="verse">After him, at the time of the Census, came Judas, the Galilaean, and was the leader in a revolt. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.38" type="verse">And now I tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave them alone--for if this scheme or work is of human origin, it will come to nothing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.39" type="verse">But if it is really from God, you will be powerless to put them down--lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually fighting against God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.40" type="verse">His advice carried conviction. So they called the Apostles in, and--after  flogging them--ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then let them go.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.41" type="verse">They, therefore,  left the Sanhedrin and went their way,  rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace on behalf of  the NAME.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.5.42" type="verse">But they did not desist from teaching every day, in the Temple or in private houses, and telling the Good News about Jesus, the Christ.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.6" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.1" type="verse">About this time, as the number of disciples was increasing, complaints were made by  the Greek-speaking Jews against the  Hebrews because their widows were habitually overlooked in the daily  ministration.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.2" type="verse">So the Twelve called together the general body of the disciples and said, "It does not seem  fitting that  we Apostles should neglect the delivery of God's Message and  minister at tables.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.3" type="verse">Therefore, brethren, pick out from among yourselves seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them to undertake this duty.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.4" type="verse">But, as for us, we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the  delivery of the Message."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.5" type="verse">The suggestion met with general approval, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.6" type="verse">These men they brought to the Apostles, and, after prayer, they laid their hands upon them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.7" type="verse">Meanwhile God's Message continued to spread, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem very greatly increased, and  very many priests obeyed the faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.8" type="verse">And Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great marvels and signs among the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.9" type="verse">But some members of the so-called `Synagogue of the Freed-men,' together with some Cyrenaeans, Alexandrians, Cilicians and  men from Roman Asia, were roused to encounter Stephen in debate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.10" type="verse">They were quite unable, however, to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.11" type="verse">Then they privately put forward men who declared, "We have heard him speak blasphemous things against Moses and against God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.12" type="verse">In this way they excited the people, the Elders, and the Scribes. At length they came upon him, seized him with violence, and took him  before the Sanhedrin.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.13" type="verse">Here they brought forward false witnesses who declared, "This fellow is incessantly speaking against the Holy Place and the Law.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.14" type="verse">For we have heard him say that Jesus, the Nazarene, will pull  this place down to the ground and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.6.15" type="verse">At once the eyes of all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin were fastened on him, and they saw his face looking just like the face of an angel.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.7" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.1" type="verse">Then the High Priest asked him, "Are these statements true?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.2" type="verse">The reply of Stephen was, "Sirs--brethren and fathers--listen to me.  God Most Glorious appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.3" type="verse">and said to him, "`Leave your country and your relatives, and go into whatever land I point out to you.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.4" type="verse">"Thereupon he left Chaldaea and settled in Haran till after the death of his father, when God caused him to remove into this country where  you now live.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.5" type="verse">But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single  square yard of ground. And yet He promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him--and promised this at a time when Abraham was childless.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.6" type="verse">And God declared that Abraham's posterity should for four hundred years make their home in a country not their own, and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.7" type="verse">"`And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them, I will judge,' said God; `and afterwards they shall come out, and they shall worship Me in this place.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.8" type="verse">"Then He gave him the Covenant of circumcision, and under this Covenant he became the father of Isaac--whom he circumcised on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.9" type="verse">"The Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.11" type="verse">But there came a famine throughout the whole of Egypt and Canaan--and great distress--so that our forefathers could find no food.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.12" type="verse">When, however, Jacob heard that there was wheat to be had, he sent our forefathers into Egypt; that was the first time.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.13" type="verse">On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Pharaoh was informed of Joseph's parentage.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.14" type="verse">Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his family, numbering  seventy-five persons, to come to him,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.19" type="verse">He adopted a crafty policy towards our race, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their infants so that they might not  be permitted to live.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.22" type="verse">So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and possessed great influence through his eloquence and his achievements.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.29" type="verse">"Alarmed at this question, Moses fled from the country and went to live in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.48" type="verse">Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings erected by men's hands. But, as the Prophet declares,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.55" type="verse">But,  full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to Heaven,  Stephen  saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.56" type="verse">"I can see Heaven wide open," he said, "and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.57" type="verse">Upon this, with a loud outcry they stopped their ears, rushed upon Stephen in a body,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.7.59" type="verse">So they  stoned Stephen,  while he prayed,  "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.7.60" type="verse">Then, rising on his knees, he cried aloud,  "Lord, do not reckon this sin against them." And with these words he fell asleep.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.8" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.1" type="verse">And Saul fully approved of his murder. At this time a great persecution broke out against the Church in Jerusalem, and  all except the Apostles were scattered throughout Judaea and Samaria.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.2" type="verse">A party of  devout men, however,  buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.3" type="verse">But Saul cruelly harassed the Church. He went into house after house, and, dragging off both men and women, threw them into prison.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.4" type="verse">Those, however, who were scattered abroad went from place to place spreading the Good News of God's Message;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.5" type="verse">while Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.6" type="verse">Crowds of people, with one accord, gave attention to what they heard from him, listening, and witnessing the signs which he did.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.7" type="verse">For, with a loud cry, foul spirits came out of many possessed by them, and many paralytics and lame persons were restored to health.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.8" type="verse">And there was great joy in that city.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.9" type="verse">Now for some time past there had been a man named Simon living there, who had been practising magic and astonishing  the Samaritans, pretending that he was more than human.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.10" type="verse">To him people of all classes paid attention, declaring, "This man is the Power of God, known as the great Power."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.11" type="verse">His influence over them arose from their having been, for a long time, bewildered by his sorceries.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.12" type="verse">But when Philip began to tell the Good News about the Kingdom of God and about the Name of Jesus Christ, and they embraced the faith, they  were baptized, men and women alike.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.13" type="verse">Simon himself also  believed, and after being baptized remained in close attendance on Philip, and was full of amazement at seeing such signs and such great miracles performed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.14" type="verse">When the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God's Message, they sent Peter and  John to visit them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.15" type="verse">They, when they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.16" type="verse">for He had not as yet fallen upon any of them. They  had only been baptized  into the name of the Lord Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.17" type="verse">Then the Apostles  placed their hands upon them, and they  received the Holy Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.18" type="verse">When, however, Simon saw that it was through the laying on of the Apostles' hands that the Spirit was bestowed, he offered them money.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.19" type="verse">"Give me too," he said, "that power, so that every one on whom I place my hands will receive the Holy Spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.20" type="verse">"Perish your money and yourself," replied Peter, "because you have imagined that you can obtain God's free gift with money!</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.21" type="verse">No part or lot have you in this  matter, for your heart is not right in God's sight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.22" type="verse">Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord,  in the hope that the  purpose which is in your heart may perhaps be forgiven you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.23" type="verse">For I perceive that you  have fallen into the bitterest bondage of unrighteousness."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.24" type="verse">"Pray, both of you, to the Lord for me," answered Simon, "that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.25" type="verse">So the Apostles, after giving a solemn charge and delivering the Lord's Message, travelled back to Jerusalem, making known the Good News also in many of the Samaritan villages.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.26" type="verse">And an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and proceed  south to  the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza,  crossing the Desert."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.27" type="verse">Upon this he rose and went. Now,  as it happened, an Ethiopian eunuch who was in a position of high authority with Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, as her treasurer, had visited Jerusalem to worship there,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.28" type="verse">and was now on his way home; and as he sat in his chariot he was  reading the Prophet Isaiah.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.29" type="verse">Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go and  enter that chariot."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.30" type="verse">So Philip ran up and heard the eunuch reading the Prophet Isaiah.  "Do you understand what you are reading?" he asked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.31" type="verse">"Why, how can I," replied the eunuch, "unless some one explains it to me?" And he earnestly invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.32" type="verse">The passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: &amp;lt;"Like a sheep He was led to slaughter, and just as a lamb before its shearer is dumb so He opened not His mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.33" type="verse">In His humiliation justice was denied Him.  Who will make known His posterity? For He is destroyed from among men."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.34" type="verse">"Pray, of whom is the Prophet speaking?" inquired the eunuch; "of himself or of some one else?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.35" type="verse">Then Philip  began to speak, and, commencing with that same portion of Scripture, told him the Good News about Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.36" type="verse">So they proceeded on their way till they came to some water; and the eunuch exclaimed, "See, here is water; what is there to prevent my being baptized?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.37" type="verse">[]</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.38" type="verse">So he stopped the chariot; and both of them--Philip and the eunuch--went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.39" type="verse">But no sooner had they come up out of the water than  the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again. With a glad heart he resumed his journey;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.8.40" type="verse">but Philip found himself at  Ashdod. Then visiting town after town he everywhere made known the Good News until he reached Caesarea.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.9" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.1" type="verse">Now Saul, whose every breath was a threat of destruction for the disciples of the Lord,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.2" type="verse">went to the High Priest and begged from him letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that if he found  any believers there, either men or women, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.3" type="verse">But on the journey, as he was getting near Damascus, suddenly there flashed round him a light from Heaven;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.4" type="verse">and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him,  "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.5" type="verse">"Who art thou, Lord?" he asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," was the reply.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.6" type="verse">"But rise and go to the city, and you will be told what you are to do.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.7" type="verse">Meanwhile the men who travelled with Saul were standing dumb with amazement, hearing a  sound, but seeing no one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.8" type="verse">Then he rose from the ground, but when he  had opened his eyes, he could not see, and they led him by the  arm and brought him to Damascus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.9" type="verse">And  for two days he remained without sight, and did not eat or drink anything.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.10" type="verse">Now in Damascus there was a disciple of the name of Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, "Ananias!" "I am here, Lord," he answered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.11" type="verse">"Rise," said the Lord, "and go to Straight Street, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man called Saul, from Tarsus, for he is actually praying.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.12" type="verse">He has seen a man called Ananias  come and lay his hands upon him so that he may recover his sight."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.13" type="verse">"Lord," answered Ananias, "I have heard about that man from many, and I have heard of the great mischief he has done to Thy  people in Jerusalem;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.14" type="verse">and here he is authorized by the High Priests to arrest all who call upon Thy name."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.15" type="verse">"Go," replied the Lord; "he is a chosen  instrument of Mine to carry My name  to the Gentiles and to kings and to the descendants of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.16" type="verse">For I will let him know the great sufferings which he must pass through for My sake."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.17" type="verse">So Ananias went and entered the house; and, laying his two hands upon Saul, said, "Saul, brother, the Lord--even Jesus who appeared to you on your journey--has sent me, that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.18" type="verse">Instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales, and he could see once more. Upon this he rose and received baptism;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.19" type="verse">after which he took food and regained his strength. Then he remained  some little time with the disciples in Damascus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.20" type="verse">And in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.21" type="verse">and his hearers were all amazed, and began to ask one another, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem  tried to exterminate those who called upon that Name, and  came here on purpose to carry them off in chains to the High Priests?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.22" type="verse">Saul, however,  gained more and more influence, and as for the Jews living in Damascus, he bewildered them with his proofs that Jesus is the Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.23" type="verse">At length the Jews plotted to kill Saul;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.24" type="verse">but information of their intention was given to him. They even watched the gates, day and night, in order to murder him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.25" type="verse">but his disciples took him by night and let him down  through the wall, lowering him in a  hamper.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.26" type="verse">So he came to Jerusalem and made several attempts to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.27" type="verse">Barnabas, however, came to his assistance. He brought Saul to the Apostles, and related to them how, on his journey, he had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.28" type="verse">Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.29" type="verse">and speaking fearlessly in the name of the Lord. And he often talked with the Hellenists and had discussions with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.30" type="verse">But they kept trying to take his life. On learning this, the brethren brought him down to Caesarea, and then  sent him by sea to Tarsus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.31" type="verse">The Church, however, throughout the whole of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria, had peace and was spiritually built up; and grew in numbers,  living in the fear of the Lord and  receiving  encouragement from the Holy Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.32" type="verse">Now Peter, as he went to town after town, came down also to  God's people at Lud.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.33" type="verse">There he found a man of the name of Aeneas, who for eight years had kept his  bed, through being paralysed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.34" type="verse">Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you. Rise and  make your own bed." He at once rose to his feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.35" type="verse">And all the people of Lud and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.36" type="verse">Among the disciples at  Jaffa was a woman called Tabitha, or, as the name may be translated,  `Dorcas.'  Her life was wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she was constantly doing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.37" type="verse">But, as it happened, just at that time she was taken ill and died. After washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.38" type="verse">Lud, however, being near Jaffa, the disciples, who had heard that Peter was at Lud, sent two men to him with an urgent request that he would come across to them without delay.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.39" type="verse">So Peter rose and went with them. On his arrival they took him upstairs, and the widow women all came and stood by his side, weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and garments of all kinds which Dorcas used to make while she was still with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.40" type="verse">Peter, however, putting every one out of the room, knelt down and prayed, and then turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, rise." Dorcas at once opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.41" type="verse">Then, giving her his hand, he raised her to her feet and, calling to him God's people and the widows, he  gave her back to them alive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.42" type="verse">This incident became known throughout Jaffa, and many  believed in the Lord;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.9.43" type="verse">and Peter remained for a considerable time at Jaffa, staying at the house of a man called Simon, a tanner.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.10" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.1" type="verse">Now a Captain of the Italian Regiment, named Cornelius, was quartered at Caesarea.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.2" type="verse">He was religious and God-fearing--and so was every member of his household. He was also liberal in his charities to the people, and continually offered prayer to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.3" type="verse">About three o'clock one afternoon he had a vision, and distinctly saw an angel of God  enter  his house, who called him by name, saying, "Cornelius!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.4" type="verse">Looking steadily at him, and being much alarmed, he said,  "What do you want, Sir?" "Your prayers and charities," he replied, "have gone up and have been recorded before God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.5" type="verse">And now send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.6" type="verse">He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, who has a house close to the sea." </seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.7" type="verse">So when the angel who had been speaking to him was gone, Cornelius called two of his  servants and a God-fearing soldier who was in constant attendance on him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.8" type="verse">and, after telling them everything, he sent them to Jaffa.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.9" type="verse">The next day, while they were still on their journey and were getting near the town, about noon Peter went up on the house-top to pray.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.10" type="verse">He had become unusually hungry and wished for food; but, while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.11" type="verse">The sky had opened to his view, and what seemed to be an enormous sail was descending, being let down to the earth by ropes at the four corners.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.12" type="verse">In it were  all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles and birds,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.13" type="verse">and a voice came to him which said, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.14" type="verse">"On no account, Lord," he replied; "for I have never yet eaten anything unholy and impure."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.15" type="verse">Again a second time a voice was heard which said, "What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.16" type="verse">This  was said three times, and immediately the sail was drawn up  out of sight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.17" type="verse">While Peter was greatly perplexed as to the meaning of the vision which he had seen, just then the men sent by Cornelius, having by inquiry found out Simon's house,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.18" type="verse">had come to the door and had called the servant, and were asking, "Is Simon, surnamed Peter, staying here?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.19" type="verse">And Peter was still earnestly thinking over the vision, when the Spirit said to him,  "Three men are now inquiring for you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.20" type="verse">Rise, go down, and go with them without any misgivings; for it is I who have sent them to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.21" type="verse">So Peter went down and said to the men, "I am the Simon you are inquiring for. What is the reason of your coming?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.22" type="verse">Their reply was, "Cornelius, a Captain, an upright and God-fearing man, of whom the whole Jewish nation speaks well, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and listen to what you have to say."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.23" type="verse">Upon hearing this, Peter invited them in, and gave them a lodging. The next day he set out with them, some of the brethren from Jaffa going with him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.24" type="verse">and the day after that they reached Caesarea. There Cornelius was awaiting their arrival, and had invited all his relatives and intimate friends to be present.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.25" type="verse">When Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him, and threw himself at his feet to do him homage.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.26" type="verse">But Peter lifted him up. "Stand up," he said; "I myself also am but a man."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.27" type="verse">So Peter went in and conversed with him, and found a large company assembled.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.28" type="verse">He said to them,  "You know better than most that a Jew  is strictly forbidden to associate with a Gentile or visit him; but God has taught me to call no one unholy or unclean.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.29" type="verse">So for this reason, when sent for, I came without raising any objection. I therefore ask why you sent for me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.30" type="verse">"Just at this hour,  three days ago," replied Cornelius, "I was offering afternoon prayer in my house, when suddenly a man in shining raiment stood in front of me,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.31" type="verse">who said, "`Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been put on record before God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.32" type="verse">Send therefore to Jaffa, and invite Simon, surnamed Peter, to come here. He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, close to the sea.' </seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.33" type="verse">"Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and  I thank you heartily for having come. That is why all of us are now assembled here in God's presence, to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to say."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.34" type="verse">Then Peter began to speak. "I clearly see," he said, "that  God makes no distinctions between one man and another;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.35" type="verse">but that in every nation those who fear Him and live good lives are acceptable to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.36" type="verse">The Message which He sent to the descendants of Israel, when He announced the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ--He is Lord of all--that Message  you cannot but know;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.37" type="verse">the story, I mean, which has spread through the length and breadth of Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.38" type="verse">It tells how God  anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the  Holy Spirit and with power, so that He went about everywhere doing acts of kindness, and curing all who were being continually oppressed by the Devil--for God was with Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.39" type="verse">"And we are witnesses as to all that He did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. But they even put Him to death,  by crucifixion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.40" type="verse">That same Jesus God raised to life on the third day, and permitted Him to appear unmistakably,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.41" type="verse">not to all the people, but to witnesses--men previously chosen by God--namely, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.42" type="verse">And He has commanded us to preach to the people and solemnly declare that this is He who has been appointed by God to be the Judge of  the living and the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.43" type="verse">To Him all the Prophets bear witness, and testify that through His name all who  believe in Him receive the forgiveness of their sins."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.44" type="verse">While Peter  was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the Message.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.45" type="verse">And all the  Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished that on the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.46" type="verse">For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling the majesty of God. Then Peter  said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.47" type="verse">"Can any one forbid the use of water, and object to these persons being baptized--men who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.10.48" type="verse">And  he directed  that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they begged him to remain with them for a time.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.11" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.1" type="verse">Now the Apostles, and the brethren  in various parts of Judaea, heard that the Gentiles also had received God's Message;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.2" type="verse">and, when Peter returned to Jerusalem, the champions of circumcision found fault with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.3" type="verse">"You went into the houses of men who are not Jews," they said, "and you ate with them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.4" type="verse">Peter, however, explained the whole matter to them from the beginning.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.5" type="verse">"While I was in the town of Jaffa, offering prayer," he said, "in a trance I saw a vision. There descended what seemed to be an enormous sail, being let down from the sky by ropes at the four corners, and it came close to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.6" type="verse">Fixing my eyes on it, I examined it closely, and saw various kinds of quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.7" type="verse">I also heard a voice saying to me, "`Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.8" type="verse">"`On no account, Lord,' I replied, `for nothing unholy or impure has ever gone into my mouth.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.9" type="verse">"But a voice answered, speaking a second time from the sky, "`What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.10" type="verse">"This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up again out of sight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.11" type="verse">"Now at that very moment three men came to the house where we were, having been sent from Caesarea to find me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.12" type="verse">And the Spirit told me to accompany them  without any misgivings. There also went with me these six brethren who are now present, and we reached the  Centurion's house.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.13" type="verse">Then he described to us how he had seen  the angel come and  enter his house and say, "`Send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.14" type="verse">He will teach you truths by which you and all your family will be saved.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.15" type="verse">"And," said Peter, "no sooner had I begun to speak than the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He fell upon us at the first.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.16" type="verse">Then I remembered the Lord's words, how He used to say, "`John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.17" type="verse">"If therefore God gave them the  same gift as He gave us when we  first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, why, who was I to be able to thwart God?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.18" type="verse">This statement of Peter's silenced his opponents. They extolled the goodness of God, and said, "So, then, to the Gentiles also God has given the repentance which leads to Life."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.19" type="verse">Those, however, who had been driven in various directions by the persecution which broke out on account of Stephen made their way to Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, delivering the Message to none but Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.20" type="verse">But some of them were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the  Greeks also and told them the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.21" type="verse">The  power of the Lord was with them, and there were a vast number who believed and turned to the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.22" type="verse">When tidings of this reached the ears of the Church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.23" type="verse">On getting there he was delighted to see the grace which God had bestowed; and he  encouraged them all to remain, with fixed resolve, faithful to the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.24" type="verse">For he was a good man, and was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith; and the number of believers in the Lord greatly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.25" type="verse">Then Barnabas paid a visit to Tarsus to try to find Saul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.26" type="verse">He succeeded, and brought him to Antioch; and for a whole year they attended the meetings of the Church, and taught a large number of people. And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of `Christians.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.27" type="verse">At  that time certain Prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.28" type="verse">one of whom, named Agabus, being instructed by the Spirit,  publicly predicted the speedy coming of a great famine throughout the world. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.29" type="verse">So the disciples decided to send relief, every one in proportion to his means, to the brethren living in Judaea.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.11.30" type="verse">This they did, forwarding their contributions to the  Elders by Barnabas and Saul.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.12" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.1" type="verse">Now, about that time, King Herod arrested certain members of the Church, in order to ill-treat them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.2" type="verse">and James, John's brother, he beheaded.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.3" type="verse">Finding that this gratified the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also; these being the days of Unleavened Bread.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.4" type="verse">He had him arrested and lodged in jail, handing him over to the care of  sixteen soldiers; and intended after the Passover to bring him out again to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.5" type="verse">So Peter was kept in prison; but long and fervent prayer was offered to God by the Church on his behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.6" type="verse">Now when Herod was on the point of taking him out of prison, that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and  guards were  on duty outside the door.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.7" type="verse">Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell; and, striking Peter on the side, he woke him and said, "Rise quickly." Instantly the chains dropped off his wrists.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.8" type="verse">"Fasten your girdle," said the angel, "and tie on your sandals." He did so. Then the angel said, "Throw your cloak round you, and follow me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.9" type="verse">So Peter went out, following him, yet could not believe that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he saw a vision.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.10" type="verse">And passing through  the first ward and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. This opened to them of itself; and, going out, they passed on through one of the streets, and then suddenly the angel left him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.11" type="verse">Peter coming to himself said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the power of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.12" type="verse">So, after thinking things over, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.13" type="verse">When he knocked at the  wicket in the door, a maidservant named  Rhoda came to answer the knock;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.14" type="verse">and recognizing Peter's voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.15" type="verse">"You are mad," they said. But she strenuously maintained that it was true. "It is his  guardian angel," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.16" type="verse">Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, until at last they opened the door and saw that it was really he, and were filled with amazement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.17" type="verse">But he motioned with his hand for silence, and then described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. "Tell all this to James and the brethren," he added. Then he left them, and went to another place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.18" type="verse">When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers, as to what could possibly have become of Peter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.19" type="verse">And when Herod had had him searched for and could not find him, after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away to execution. He then went down from Judaea to Caesarea and remained there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.20" type="verse">Now the people of Tyre and Sidon had incurred Herod's violent displeasure. So they sent a large deputation to wait on him; and having secured the good will of Blastus, his treasurer, they begged the king  to be friendly with them again, because their country was dependent on his for its food supply.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.21" type="verse">So, on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal robes, took his seat on the tribunal, and was haranguing them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.22" type="verse">and the assembled people kept shouting, "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.23" type="verse">Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the glory to God, and being eaten up by worms, he  died.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.24" type="verse">But God's Message prospered, and converts were multiplied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.12.25" type="verse">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having discharged their mission, and they brought with them John, surnamed Mark.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.13.1" type="verse">Now there were in Antioch,  in the Church there--as Prophets and teachers--barnabas,  Symeon surnamed `the black,' Lucius the Cyrenaean, Manaen  (who was Herod the Tetrarch's foster-brother), and Saul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.2" type="verse">While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me, now at once, Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.3" type="verse">So, after fasting and prayer and the laying on of hands, they let them go.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.4" type="verse">They therefore, being thus sent out by the Holy Spirit, went  down to Seleuceia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.5" type="verse">Having reached Salamis, they began to announce God's Message in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John as their  assistant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.6" type="verse">When they had gone through the whole length of the island as far as Paphos, they there met with a Jewish magician and false prophet,  Bar-Jesus by name,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.13.8" type="verse">But  Elymas (or `the Magician,' for such is the meaning of the name) opposed them, and tried to  prevent the Proconsul from accepting the faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.9" type="verse">Then Saul, who is also called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, fixing his eyes on Elymas,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.10" type="verse">said, "You who are full of every kind of craftiness and unscrupulous cunning--you son of the Devil and foe to all that is right--will you never cease  to misrepresent the straight paths of the Lord?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.11" type="verse">The Lord's hand is now upon you, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the light of day." Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness, and, as he walked about, he begged people to lead him  by the hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.12" type="verse">Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being struck with amazement at  the teaching of the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.13" type="verse">From Paphos, Paul and his party put out to sea and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.14" type="verse">But they themselves, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. Here, on the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.15" type="verse">After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Wardens of the synagogue sent word to them. "Brethren," they said, "if you have anything encouraging to say to the people, speak."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.13.16" type="verse">So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand for silence, said, "Israelites, and you others who fear God, pay attention to me.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.14.14" type="verse">But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it; and tearing their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd, exclaiming, "Sirs, why are you doing all this?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.15" type="verse">We also are but men, with  natures kindred to your own; and we bring you the Good News that you are to turn from these unreal things, to worship the ever-living God, the Creator of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.16" type="verse">In times gone by He allowed all the nations to go their own ways;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.17" type="verse">and yet by His beneficence He has not left His existence unattested--His beneficence, I mean, in sending you rain from Heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.18" type="verse">Even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.19" type="verse">But now a party of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and, having won over the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, believing him to be dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.20" type="verse">When, however, the disciples had collected round him, he rose and went back into the town. The next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.21" type="verse">and, after proclaiming the Good News to the people there and gaining a large number of converts, they retraced their steps to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.22" type="verse">Everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging them to hold fast to the faith, and warned them saying, "It is through many afflictions that we must make our way into the Kingdom of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.23" type="verse">And in every Church, after prayer and fasting, they  selected Elders  by show of hands, and commended them to the Lord on whom their faith rested.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.24" type="verse">Then passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.25" type="verse">and after telling the Message at Perga they came down to Attaleia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.26" type="verse">Thence they sailed to Antioch, where they had previously been commended to the grace of God in connexion with the work which they had now completed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.27" type="verse">Upon their arrival they called the Church together and proceeded to report in detail all that God, working with them, had done, and how He had opened for the Gentiles the door of faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.14.28" type="verse">And they remained a considerable time in Antioch with the disciples.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.15.1" type="verse">But certain persons who had come down from Judaea tried to convince the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom, you cannot be saved."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.2" type="verse">Between these new comers and Paul and Barnabas there was no little disagreement and controversy, until at last it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some other brethren should go up to consult the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem on this matter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.3" type="verse">So they set out, being accompanied for a short distance by some other members of the Church; and as they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the whole story of the conversion of the Gentiles and inspired all the brethren with great joy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.4" type="verse">Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were cordially received by the Church, the Apostles, and  the Elders; and they reported in detail all that God, working with them, had done.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.15.21" type="verse">For Moses from  the earliest times  has had his preachers in every town, being read, as he is, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the various synagogues."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.22" type="verse">Thereupon it was decided by the Apostles and Elders, with the approval of the whole Church, to choose suitable persons from among themselves and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas. Judas, called Bar-sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, were selected,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.15.27" type="verse">We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who are themselves bringing you the same message by word of mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.28" type="verse">For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements--</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.15.30" type="verse">They, therefore, having been solemnly sent, came down to Antioch, where they called together the whole assembly and delivered the letter.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.31" type="verse">The people  read it, and were delighted with the comfort it brought them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.32" type="verse">And Judas and Silas, being themselves also  Prophets, gave  them a long and encouraging talk, and strengthened them in the faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.33" type="verse">After spending some time there they received an affectionate farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.15.35" type="verse">But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and, in company with many others, telling the Good News of the Lord's Message.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.36" type="verse">After a while Paul said to Barnabas, "Suppose we now revisit the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known the Lord's Message--to see whether they are prospering!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.37" type="verse">Barnabas, however, was bent on taking with them John, whose other name was Mark,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.38" type="verse">while Paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.39" type="verse">So there arose a serious disagreement between them, which resulted in their parting from one another, Barnabas taking Mark and setting sail for Cyprus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.15.40" type="verse">But Paul chose Silas as his travelling companion; and set out, after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.16.1" type="verse">He also came to Derbe and to Lystra. At Lystra he found a disciple, Timothy by name--the son of  a Christian Jewess, though he had a Greek father.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.2" type="verse">Timothy was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.3" type="verse">and Paul desiring that he should accompany him on his journey, took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.4" type="verse">As they journeyed on from town to town, they handed to the brethren for their observance the decisions which had been arrived at by the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.5" type="verse">So the Churches went on gaining a stronger faith and growing in numbers from day to day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.6" type="verse">Then  Paul and his companions passed through  Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Message in the province of Asia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.7" type="verse">When they reached the frontier of Mysia, they were about to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit this.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.8" type="verse">So,  passing along Mysia, they came to  Troas.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.9" type="verse">Here, one night, Paul saw a vision. There was a Macedonian who was standing, entreating him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.10" type="verse">So when he had seen the vision, we immediately looked out for an opportunity of passing on into Macedonia, confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the Good News to the people there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.11" type="verse">Accordingly we put out to sea from Troas, and ran a straight course to Samothrace. The next day we came to Neapolis,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.12" type="verse">and thence to Philippi,  which is a city in Macedonia, the first in its district, a Roman colony. And there we stayed some little time.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.13" type="verse">On the Sabbath we went beyond the city gate to the riverside, where we had reason to believe that there was a place for prayer; and sitting down we talked with the women who had come together.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.14" type="verse">Among our hearers was one named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods. She belonged to the city of Thyateira, and was a worshipper  of the true God. The Lord opened her heart, so that she gave attention to what Paul was saying.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.15" type="verse">When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If  in your judgement I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she made us go there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.16" type="verse">One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who  claimed to be inspired and was accustomed to bring her owners large profits by telling fortunes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.17" type="verse">She kept following close behind Paul and the rest of us, crying aloud, "These men are the bondservants of the Most High God, and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.18" type="verse">This she persisted in  for a considerable time, until Paul,  wearied out, turned round and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out  immediately.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.19" type="verse">But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the  magistrates in the public square.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.20" type="verse">Then they brought them before the praetors. "These men," they said, "are creating a great disturbance in our city.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.21" type="verse">They are Jews, and are teaching customs which we, as Romans, are not permitted to adopt or practise."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.22" type="verse">The crowd, too,  joined in the outcry against them, till at length the praetors  ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.23" type="verse">and, after severely flogging them, they threw them into jail and bade the jailer keep them safely.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.24" type="verse">He, having received an order like that, lodged them in the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.25" type="verse">About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.26" type="verse">when suddenly there was such a violent shock of earthquake that the prison shook to its foundations. Instantly the doors all flew open, and the chains  fell off from every prisoner.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.27" type="verse">Starting up from sleep and seeing the doors of the jail wide open, the jailer drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.28" type="verse">But Paul shouted loudly to him, saying, "Do yourself no injury: we are all here.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.29" type="verse">Then, calling for lights, he sprang in and fell trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.30" type="verse">and, bringing them out of the prison, he exclaimed, "O sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.31" type="verse">"Believe on the Lord Jesus," they replied, "and both you and your household will be saved."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.32" type="verse">And they told  the Lord's Message to him as well as to all who were in his house.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.33" type="verse">Then he took them, even at that time of night, washed their wounds, and he and all his household were immediately baptized;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.34" type="verse">and bringing the Apostles up into his house, he spread a meal for them, and was filled with gladness,  with his whole household,  his faith resting on God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.35" type="verse">In the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order, "Release those men."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.36" type="verse">So the jailer brought Paul word, saying, "The praetors  have sent orders for you to be released. Now therefore you can go, and proceed on your way in peace."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.37" type="verse">But Paul said to them, "After  cruelly beating us in public, without trial, Roman citizens though we are, they have thrown us into prison, and are they now going to send us away privately?  No, indeed! Let them come in person and fetch us out."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.38" type="verse">This answer the lictors took back to the praetors, who were alarmed when they were told that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.39" type="verse">Accordingly they came and  apologized to them; and, bringing them out, asked them to leave the city.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.16.40" type="verse">Then Paul and Silas, having come out of the prison, went to Lydia's house; and, after seeing the brethren and encouraging them, they left Philippi.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.17" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.1" type="verse">Then, passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.2" type="verse">Paul--following his usual custom--betook himself to it, and  for three successive Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.3" type="verse">which he clearly explained, pointing out that it had been necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise again from the dead, and insisting, "The Jesus whom I am announcing to you is the Christ."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.4" type="verse">Some of the people were won over, and  attached themselves to Paul and Silas, including many  God-fearing Greeks and not a few gentlewomen of high rank.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.5" type="verse">But the jealousy of the Jews was aroused, and, calling to their aid some ill-conditioned and idle fellows, they got together a riotous mob and filled the city with uproar. They then attacked the house of Jason and searched for Paul and Silas, to bring them out before the assembly of people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.6" type="verse">But, failing to find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other brethren before the  magistrates of the city, loudly accusing them. "These men," they said, "who have raised a tumult throughout the Empire, have come here also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.7" type="verse">Jason has received them into his house; and they all set Caesar's  authority at defiance, declaring that there is another  Emperor--  one called Jesus."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.8" type="verse">Great was the excitement among the crowd, and among the magistrates of the city, when they heard these charges.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.9" type="verse">They required Jason and the rest to find substantial bail, and after that they let them go.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.10" type="verse">The brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea, and they, on their arrival, went to the synagogue of the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.11" type="verse">The Jews at Beroea were of a nobler disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they very readily received the Message, and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether  it was as Paul stated.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.12" type="verse">As the result many of them became believers, and so did not a few of the Greeks--gentlewomen of good position, and men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.13" type="verse">As soon, however, as the  Jews of Thessalonica learnt that God's Message  had been proclaimed by Paul at Beroea, they came there also, and incited the mob to a riot.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.14" type="verse">Then the brethren promptly sent Paul down to the sea-coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.15" type="verse">Those who were caring for Paul's safety went with him as far as Athens, and then left him, taking a message from him to Silas and Timothy, asking them to join him as speedily as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.16" type="verse">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit  was stirred within him when he noticed that the city was full of idols.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.17" type="verse">So he  had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the other  worshippers, and in the market place, day after day, with those whom he happened to meet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.18" type="verse">A few of the Epicurean and Stoic  philosophers also  encountered him. Some of them asked, "What has this  beggarly babbler to say?" "His business," said others, "seems to be to cry up some foreign gods." This was because he had been telling the Good News of Jesus and the  Resurrection.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.19" type="verse">Then they  took him and brought him up to  the Areopagus, asking him, "May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.20" type="verse">For the things you are saying sound strange to us. We should therefore like to be told exactly what they mean."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.21" type="verse">(For all the Athenians and their foreign visitors used to devote their whole leisure to telling or hearing about something new.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.22" type="verse">So Paul, taking his stand in the centre of the Areopagus, spoke as follows:  "Men of Athens, I perceive that you are in every respect remarkably religious.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.23" type="verse">For as I passed along and observed the things you worship, I found also an altar bearing the inscription,  `TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'  "The Being, therefore, whom you, without knowing Him, revere, Him I now proclaim to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.24" type="verse">GOD who made the universe and everything in it--He, being Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries built by men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.25" type="verse">Nor is He ministered to by human hands, as though He needed anything--but He Himself gives to all men life and breath and all things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.26" type="verse">He caused to spring  from one forefather people of every race, for them to live on the whole surface of the earth, and marked out for them an appointed span of life and the boundaries of their homes;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.27" type="verse">that they might seek God, if perhaps they could grope for Him and find Him. Yes, though He is not far from any one of us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.28" type="verse">For it is in closest union with Him that we live and move and have our being; as in fact some of the poets in repute among yourselves have said, `For we are also His offspring.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.29" type="verse">Since then we are God's offspring, we ought not to imagine that His nature resembles gold or silver or marble, or anything sculptured by the art and inventive faculty of man.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.30" type="verse">Those times of ignorance God viewed with indulgence. But now He commands all men everywhere to repent,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.31" type="verse">seeing that He has appointed a day on which, before long, He will judge  the world in righteousness,  through the instrumentality of a man whom He has pre-destined to this work, and has made the fact certain to every one by raising Him from the dead."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.32" type="verse">When they heard Paul speak of a resurrection of dead men, some began to scoff. But others said, "We will hear you again on that subject."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.33" type="verse">So Paul went away from them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.17.34" type="verse">A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed, among them being Dionysius a member of the Council, a gentlewoman named Damaris, and some others.</seg>

        <div id="b.ACT.18" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.1" type="verse">After this he left Athens and came to Corinth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.2" type="verse">Here he found a Jew,  a native of Pontus, of the name of Aquila. He and his wife Priscilla had recently come from Italy because of Claudius's edict expelling all the Jews from Rome. So Paul paid them a visit;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.3" type="verse">and because he was of the same trade--that of  tent-maker--he lodged with them  and worked with them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.4" type="verse">But, Sabbath after Sabbath, he preached in the synagogue and tried to win over both Jews and Greeks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.5" type="verse">Now at the time when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.6" type="verse">But upon their opposing him with abusive language, he shook his clothes by way of protest, and said to them, "Your ruin will be upon your own heads. I am not responsible: in future I will go among the Gentiles."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.7" type="verse">So he left the place and went to the house of a person called Titius Justus, a worshipper of the true God. His house was next door to the synagogue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.8" type="verse">And Crispus, the Warden of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, and so did all his household; and  from time to time many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and received baptism.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.9" type="verse">And, in a vision by night, the Lord said to Paul, "Dismiss your fears: go on speaking, and do not give up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.10" type="verse">I am with you, and no one shall attack you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.11" type="verse">So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months, teaching among them the Message of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.12" type="verse">But when Gallio became Proconsul of Greece, the Jews with one accord made a dead set at Paul, and brought him before the court.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.13" type="verse">"This man," they said, "is inducing people to offer unlawful worship to God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.14" type="verse">But, when Paul was about to begin his defence, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it had been some wrongful act or piece of cunning knavery I might reasonably have listened to you Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.15" type="verse">But since these are questions about words and names and your Law, you yourselves must see to them. I refuse to be a judge in such matters."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.16" type="verse">So he ordered them out of court.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.17" type="verse">Then the people all set upon Sosthenes, the Warden of  the synagogue, and beat him  severely in front of the court. Gallio did not concern himself in the least about this.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.18" type="verse">After remaining a considerable time longer in Corinth, Paul took leave of the brethren and set sail for Syria; and Priscilla and Aquila were with him.  He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, because he was bound by a vow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.19" type="verse">They put in at Ephesus, and there Paul left his companions behind. As for himself, he went to the synagogue and  had a discussion with the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.20" type="verse">When they asked him to remain longer he did not consent,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.21" type="verse">but took leave of them with the promise, "I will return to you, God willing." So he set sail from Ephesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.22" type="verse">Landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and inquired after the welfare of the Church, and then went down to Antioch.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.23" type="verse">After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a tour, visiting the whole of Galatia and Phrygia in order, and strengthening all the disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.24" type="verse">Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria,  a man of great learning and well versed in the Scriptures.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.25" type="verse">He had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of the Lord, and, being full of burning zeal, he used to speak and teach accurately the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John's.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.26" type="verse">He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla and Aquila, after hearing him, took him home and explained  God's way to him more accurately.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.27" type="verse">Then, as he had made up his mind to cross over into Greece, the brethren wrote to the disciples in Corinth begging them to give him a kindly welcome. Upon his arrival he rendered valuable help to those who through grace had believed;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.18.28" type="verse">for he powerfully and in public overcame the Jews in argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.19" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.1" type="verse">During the stay of Apollos in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the inland districts, came to Ephesus, where he found a few disciples.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.2" type="verse">"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you  first believed?" he asked them. "No," they replied, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.3" type="verse">"Into what then were you baptized?" he asked.  "Into John's baptism," they replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.4" type="verse">"John," he said, "administered a baptism  of repentance, bidding the people believe on One who was to come after him; namely, on Jesus."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.5" type="verse">On hearing this, they were baptized  into the name of the Lord Jesus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.6" type="verse">and when Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and  to prophesy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.7" type="verse">They numbered in all about twelve men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.8" type="verse">Afterwards he went into the synagogue. There for three months he continued to preach fearlessly, explaining in words which carried conviction the truths which concern the Kingdom of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.9" type="verse">But some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of  the new faith before all the congregation. So Paul left them, and,  taking with him those who were disciples, held discussions daily in Tyrannus's lecture-hall.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.10" type="verse">This went on for two years, so that  all the inhabitants of the province of Asia, Jews as well as Greeks, heard the Lord's Message.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.11" type="verse">God also brought about extraordinary miracles through Paul's instrumentality.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.12" type="verse">Towels or aprons, for instance, which Paul had handled used to be carried to the sick, and they recovered from their ailments,  or the evil spirits left them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.13" type="verse">But there were also some wandering Jewish exorcists who undertook to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, "I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.14" type="verse">There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew of high-priestly family, who were doing this.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.15" type="verse">"Jesus I know," the evil spirit answered, "and Paul  I have heard of, but who are you?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.16" type="verse">And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them, over-mastered them both, and treated them with such violence, that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.17" type="verse">All the people of Ephesus, Jews as well as Greeks, came to know of this. There was widespread terror, and they  began to hold the name of the Lord Jesus in high honour.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.18" type="verse">Many also of those who  believed  came confessing without reserve what their conduct had been,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.19" type="verse">and not a few of those who had practised magical arts brought their books together and  burnt them in the presence of all. The total value was reckoned and found to be  50,000 silver coins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.20" type="verse">Thus mightily did the Lord's Message spread and triumph!</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.21" type="verse">When matters had reached this point, Paul decided in his own  mind to travel through Macedonia and Greece, and go to Jerusalem. "After that," he said, "I must also see Rome."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.22" type="verse">But he sent two of  his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself remained for a while in Roman Asia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.23" type="verse">Now just at that time there arose no small commotion about  the new faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.24" type="verse">There was a certain Demetrius, a silversmith, who made miniature silver sanctuaries of  Diana, a business which brought great gain to the mechanics in his employ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.25" type="verse">He called his workmen together, and others who were engaged in similar trades, and said to them, "You men well know that our prosperity depends on this business of ours;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.26" type="verse">and you see and hear that, not in Ephesus only but throughout almost the whole province of Asia, this fellow Paul has led away a vast number of people by inducing them to believe that they are not gods at all that are made by men's hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.27" type="verse">There is danger,  therefore, not only that this our trade will become of no account, but also that the  temple of the great goddess Diana will fall into utter disrepute, and that before long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank--she who is now worshipped by the whole province of Asia; nay, by the whole world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.28" type="verse">After listening to this harangue, they became furiously angry and kept calling out, "Great is the Ephesian Diana!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.29" type="verse">The riot and uproar spread through the whole city, till at last with one accord they rushed into  the Theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were fellow travellers with Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.30" type="verse">Then Paul would have liked to go in and address the people, but the disciples would not let him do so.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.31" type="verse">A few of the  public officials, too, who were friendly to him, sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture into the Theatre.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.32" type="verse">The people, meanwhile, kept shouting,  some one thing and some another; for the assembly was all uproar and confusion, and the greater part had no idea why they had come together.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.33" type="verse">Then some of the people  crowded round Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand to get silence, was prepared to make a defence to the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.34" type="verse">No sooner, however, did they see that he was a Jew, than there arose from them all one roar of shouting, lasting about two hours. "Great is the Ephesian Diana," they said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.35" type="verse">At length the  Recorder quieted them down. "Men of Ephesus," he said, "who is there of all mankind that needs to be told that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.36" type="verse">These facts, then, being unquestioned, it becomes you to maintain your self-control and not act recklessly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.37" type="verse">For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.38" type="verse">If, however, Demetrius and the mechanics who support his contention have a grievance against any one,  there are Assize-days and there are Proconsuls: let the persons interested accuse one another.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.39" type="verse">But if you desire  anything further, it will have to be settled in the regular assembly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.40" type="verse">For in connexion with to-day's proceedings there is danger of our being charged with attempted insurrection, there having been no real reason for this riot; nor shall we be able to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.19.41" type="verse">With these words he dismissed the assembly.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.20" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.1" type="verse">When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples; and, after speaking words of encouragement to them, he took his leave, and started for Macedonia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.2" type="verse">Passing through those districts he encouraged the disciples in frequent addresses, and then came into  Greece, and spent three months there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.3" type="verse">The Jews having planned to waylay him whenever he might be on the point of taking ship for Syria, he decided to travel back by way of Macedonia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.4" type="verse">He was accompanied as far as the province of Asia by Sopater the Beroean, the son of Pyrrhus; by the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; by Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and by the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.5" type="verse">These brethren had gone on and were waiting for us in the Troad.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.6" type="verse">But we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined them in the Troad, where we remained for a week.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.7" type="verse">On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul, who was going away the next morning, was preaching to them, and prolonged his discourse till midnight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.8" type="verse">Now there were a good many lamps in the room upstairs where we all were,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.9" type="verse">and a youth of the name of Eutychus was sitting at the window. This lad, gradually sinking into deep sleep while Paul preached at unusual length, overcome at last by sleep, fell from the second floor and was taken up dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.10" type="verse">Paul, however, went down, threw himself upon him, and folding him in his arms said,  "Do not be alarmed; his life is still in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.11" type="verse">Then he went  upstairs again, broke bread, and took some food; and after a long conversation which was continued till daybreak, at last he parted from them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.12" type="verse">They had taken the lad home alive, and were greatly comforted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.13" type="verse">The rest of us had already gone on board a ship, and now we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had arranged, he himself intending to go by land.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.14" type="verse">Accordingly, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.15" type="verse">Sailing from there, we arrived the next day  off Chios. On the next we touched at  Samos; and on the day following reached Miletus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.16" type="verse">For Paul's plan was to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend much time in the province of Asia; since he was very desirous of being in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of the  Harvest Festival.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.17" type="verse">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the  Elders of the Church to come to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.18" type="verse">Upon their arrival he said to them, "You Elders well know, from the first day of my setting foot in the province of Asia, the kind of life I lived among you the whole time,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.19" type="verse">serving the Lord  in all humility, and  with  tears, and  amid trials which came upon me through the plotting of the Jews--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.20" type="verse">and that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, or from teaching you in public and in your homes,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.20.22" type="verse">"And now,  impelled by a sense of duty, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.20.24" type="verse">But even  the sacrifice of my life I count as nothing, if only I may perfect my earthly course, and be faithful to the  duty which the Lord Jesus has entrusted to me of proclaiming, as of supreme importance, the Good News of God's grace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.25" type="verse">"And now, I know that none of you among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom will any longer see my face.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.20.28" type="verse">"Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has  placed you to take the oversight  for Him and act as shepherds to  the Church of God, which He has bought with His own blood.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.29" type="verse">I know that, when I am gone, cruel wolves will come among you and will not spare the flock;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.30" type="verse">and that from among your own selves men will rise up who will seek with their perverse talk to draw away the disciples after them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.31" type="verse">Therefore be on the alert; and remember that, night and day, for three years, I never ceased admonishing every one, even with tears.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.32" type="verse">"And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace. He is able to build you up and to give you your inheritance among His people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.33" type="verse">No one's silver or gold or clothing  have I coveted.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.20.34" type="verse">You yourselves know that  these hands of mine have provided for my own necessities and for the people with me.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.20.36" type="verse">Having spoken thus, Paul knelt down and prayed with them all;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.21.3" type="verse">After sighting Cyprus and leaving that island on our left, we continued our voyage to Syria and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.4" type="verse">Having searched for the disciples and found them, we stayed at Tyre for seven days; and, taught by the Spirit, they repeatedly urged Paul not to proceed to Jerusalem.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.21.12" type="verse">As soon as we heard these words, both we and the brethren at Caesarea entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.21.19" type="verse">After exchanging friendly greetings, Paul told in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his instrumentality.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.20" type="verse">And they, when they had heard his statement, gave the glory to God. Then they said, "You see, brother,  how many tens of thousands of Jews there are among those who have accepted the faith, and they are all zealous upholders of the Law.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.21" type="verse">Now what they have been repeatedly told about you is that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you forbid them to circumcise their children or observe old-established customs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.22" type="verse">What then ought you to do? They are sure to hear that you have come to Jerusalem;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.23" type="verse">so do this which we now tell you. We have four men here who have a vow resting on them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.24" type="verse">Associate with these men and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads. Then everybody will know that there is no truth in these stories about you, but that in your own actions you yourself  scrupulously obey the Law.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.25" type="verse">But as for the Gentiles who have accepted the faith, we have communicated to them our decision  that they are carefully to abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.26" type="verse">So Paul associated with the men; and the next day,  having purified himself with them, he  went into the Temple, giving  every one to understand that the days of their purification were finished, and there he remained  until the sacrifice for each of them was offered.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.27" type="verse">But, when the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from the province of Asia, having seen Paul in the Temple, set about rousing the fury of all the people against him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.28" type="verse">They laid hands on him, crying out, "Men of Israel, help! help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the Jewish people and the Law and this place. And besides, he has even brought Gentiles into the Temple and has desecrated this holy place."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.29" type="verse">(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and imagined that Paul had brought him into the Temple.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.30" type="verse">The excitement spread through the whole city, and the people rushed in crowds to the Temple, and there laid hold of Paul and began to drag him out; and the Temple gates were immediately closed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.31" type="verse">But while they were trying to kill Paul, word was taken up to the Tribune in command of the battalion, that all Jerusalem was in a ferment.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.32" type="verse">He instantly sent for a few soldiers and their officers, and came down among the people with all speed. At the sight of the Tribune and the troops they ceased beating Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.33" type="verse">Then the Tribune, making his way to him, arrested him, and, having ordered him to be secured with two chains, proceeded to ask who he was and what he had been doing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.34" type="verse">Some of the crowd shouted one accusation against Paul and some another, until, as the uproar made it impossible for the truth to be ascertained with certainty, the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.35" type="verse">When Paul was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.36" type="verse">for the whole mass of the people pressed on in the rear, shouting, "Away with him!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.37" type="verse">When he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the Tribune, "May I speak to you?" "Do you know Greek?" the Tribune asked.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.38" type="verse">"Are you not the Egyptian who some years ago excited the riot of the 4,000  cut-throats, and led them out into the Desert?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.39" type="verse">"I am a Jew," replied Paul, "belonging to Tarsus in Cilicia, and am a citizen of no unimportant city. Give me leave, I pray you, to speak to the people."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.21.40" type="verse">So with his permission Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people to be quiet; and when there was perfect silence he addressed them in Hebrew.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.22" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.1" type="verse">"Brethren and fathers," he said, "listen to my defence which I now make before you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.2" type="verse">And on hearing him address them in Hebrew, they kept all the more quiet; and he said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.3" type="verse">"I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day, was zealous for God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.4" type="verse">I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding both men and women and throwing them into prison;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.5" type="verse">as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness. It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus, intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains to Jerusalem, to be punished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.6" type="verse">"But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.7" type="verse">I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, "`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.8" type="verse">"`Who art thou, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus, the Nazarene,' He replied, `whom you are persecuting.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.9" type="verse">"Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light, did not hear the  words of Him who spoke to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.10" type="verse">And I asked, "`What am I to do, Lord?' "And the Lord said to me, "`Rise, and go into Damascus. There you shall be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.11" type="verse">"And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling, those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I came to Damascus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.12" type="verse">"And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore a good character with all the Jews of the city,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.13" type="verse">came to me and standing at my side said, "`Brother Saul, recover your sight.' "I instantly  regained my sight and looked up at him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.14" type="verse">Then he said, `The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.15" type="verse">For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what  you have seen and heard.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.16" type="verse">And now why delay? Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off your sins, calling upon His name.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.17" type="verse">"After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.18" type="verse">I saw Jesus, and He said to me, "`Make haste and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.19" type="verse">"`Lord,' I replied, `they themselves well know how active I was in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue those who believe in Thee;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.20" type="verse">and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness, I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes of those who were killing him.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.21" type="verse">"`Go,' He replied; `I will send you as an Apostle  to nations far away.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.22" type="verse">Until they heard this last statement the people listened to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought not to be allowed to live."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.23" type="verse">And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their clothes into the air and flinging dust about,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.24" type="verse">the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason why they thus cried out against him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.25" type="verse">But, when they had tied him up  with the straps, Paul said to the Captain who stood by, "Does the Law permit you to flog a Roman citizen--and one too who is uncondemned?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.26" type="verse">On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter to the Tribune.  "What are you intending to do?" he said. "This man is a Roman citizen."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.27" type="verse">So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.28" type="verse">"I paid a large sum for my citizenship," said the Tribune. "But I was born free," said Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.29" type="verse">So the men who had been on the point of putting him  under torture immediately left him. And the Tribune, too, was frightened when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.22.30" type="verse">The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.23" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.1" type="verse">Then Paul, fixing a steady gaze on the Sanhedrin, said, "Brethren, it is with a perfectly clear conscience that I have discharged my duties before God up to this day."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.2" type="verse">On hearing this the High Priest Ananias ordered those who were standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.3" type="verse">"Before long," exclaimed Paul,  "God will strike you, you white-washed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me in accordance with the Law, and do you yourself actually break the Law by ordering me to be struck?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.4" type="verse">"Do you rail at God's High Priest?" cried the men who stood by him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.5" type="verse">"I did not know, brethren," replied Paul, "that he was the High Priest; for it is written, &amp;lt;`Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of Thy people.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.6" type="verse">Noticing, however, that the Sanhedrin consisted partly of Sadducees and partly of  Pharisees, he called out loudly among them, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees. It is because of my hope of a resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.7" type="verse">These words of his caused an angry dispute between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly took different sides.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.8" type="verse">For the Sadducees maintain that there is no resurrection, and neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge the existence of both.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.9" type="verse">So there arose a great uproar; and some of the Scribes belonging to the sect of the Pharisees sprang to their feet and fiercely contended, saying, "We find no harm in the man.  What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel----!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.10" type="verse">But when the struggle was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by the people, ordered the troops to go down and take him from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.11" type="verse">The following night the Lord came and stood at Paul's side, and said, "Be of good courage, for as you have borne faithful witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.12" type="verse">Now, when daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and solemnly swore not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.13" type="verse">There were more than forty of them who bound themselves by this oath.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.14" type="verse">They went to the High Priests and Elders and said to them, "We have bound ourselves under a heavy curse  to take no food till we have killed Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.15" type="verse">Now therefore you and the Sanhedrin should make representations to the Tribune for him to bring him down to you, under the impression that you intend to inquire more minutely about him; and we are prepared to assassinate him before he comes near the place."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.16" type="verse">But Paul's sister's son heard of the intended attack upon him. So he came and went into the barracks and told Paul about it;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.17" type="verse">and Paul called one of the Captains and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has information to give him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.18" type="verse">So he took him and brought him to the Tribune, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me to him and begged me to bring this youth to you, because he has something to say to you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.19" type="verse">Then the Tribune, taking him by the  arm, withdrew  out of the hearing of others and asked him, "What have you to tell me?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.20" type="verse">"The Jews," he replied, "have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin to-morrow for the purpose of making yourself more accurately acquainted with the case.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.21" type="verse">I beg you not to comply; for more than forty men among them are lying in wait for him, who have solemnly vowed that they will neither eat nor drink till they have assassinated him; and even now they are ready, in anticipation of receiving that promise of you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.22" type="verse">So the Tribune sent the youth home, cautioning him. "Do not let any one know that you have given me this information," he said.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.23" type="verse">Then, calling to him two of the Captains, he gave his orders. "Get ready two hundred men," he said, "to march to Caesarea, with seventy cavalry and two hundred light infantry, starting at nine o'clock to-night."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.24" type="verse">He further told them to provide  horses to mount Paul on, so as to bring him safely to Felix the Governor.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.25" type="verse">He also wrote a letter of which these were the  contents:</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.26" type="verse">"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Felix the Governor: all good wishes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.27" type="verse">This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and they were on the point of killing him, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, for I had been informed that he was a Roman citizen.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.28" type="verse">And, wishing to know with certainty the offense of which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.29" type="verse">and I discovered that the charge had to do with questions of their Law, but that he was accused of nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.30" type="verse">But now that I have received information of an intended attack upon him, I immediately send him to you, directing his accusers also to state before you the case they have against him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.31" type="verse">So, in obedience to their orders, the soldiers took Paul and brought him by night as far as Antipatris.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.32" type="verse">The next day the infantry returned to the barracks, leaving the cavalry to proceed with him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.33" type="verse">and, the cavalry having reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, they brought Paul also to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.34" type="verse">Felix, after reading the letter, inquired from what province he was; and being told "from Cilicia,"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.23.35" type="verse">he said, "I will hear all you have to say, when your accusers also have come." And he ordered him to be detained in custody in Herod's Palace.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.24" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.1" type="verse">Five days after this, Ananias the High Priest came down to Caesarea with a number of Elders and a pleader called Tertullus. They stated to the Governor the case against Paul.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.2" type="verse">So Paul was sent for, and Tertullus began to impeach him as follows: "Indebted as we are," he said, "to you, most noble Felix, for the perfect peace which we enjoy, and for reforms which your wisdom has introduced to this nation,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.3" type="verse">in every instance and in every place we accept them with profound gratitude.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.4" type="verse">But--not to detain you too long--I beg you in your forbearance to listen to a brief statement from us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.5" type="verse">For we have found this man Paul a source of mischief and a disturber of the peace among all the Jews throughout the Empire, and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.6" type="verse">He even attempted to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.7" type="verse">[]</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.8" type="verse">You, however, by examining him, will yourself be able to learn the truth as to all this which we allege against him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.9" type="verse">The Jews also  joined in the charge, maintaining that these were facts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.10" type="verse">Then, at  a sign from the Governor, Paul answered, "Knowing,  Sir, that for many years you have administered justice to this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.11" type="verse">For you have it in your power to ascertain that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship in Jerusalem;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.12" type="verse">and that neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues, nor anywhere in the city, did they find me disputing with any opponent or collecting a crowd about me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.13" type="verse">Nor can they  prove the charges which they are now bringing against me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.14" type="verse">But this I confess to you--that in the way which they style a heresy, I worship the God of our forefathers, believing everything that is taught in the Law or is written in the Prophets,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.15" type="verse">and having a hope directed towards God, which my accusers themselves also entertain, that before long there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.16" type="verse">This too is my own earnest endeavour--always to have a clear conscience in relation to God and man.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.17" type="verse">"Now after an interval of several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.18" type="verse">While I was busy about these, they found me in the Temple purified, with no crowd around me and no uproar; but there were certain Jews from the province of Asia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.19" type="verse">They ought to have been here before you, and to have been my prosecutors, if they have any charge to bring against me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.20" type="verse">Or let these men themselves say what misdemeanour they found me guilty of when I stood before the Sanhedrin,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.21" type="verse">unless it was in that one expression which I made use of when I shouted out as I stood among them, "`The resurrection of the dead is the thing about which I am on my trial before you to-day.'"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.22" type="verse">At this point Felix, who was fairly well informed about the new faith, adjourned the trial, saying to the Jews, "When the Tribune Lysias comes down, I will enter carefully into the matter."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.23" type="verse">And he gave orders to the Captain that Paul was to be kept in custody, but be treated with indulgence, and that his personal friends were not to be prevented from showing him kindness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.24" type="verse">Not long after this, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, a Jewess, and sending for Paul, listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.25" type="verse">But when he dealt with the subjects of justice,  self-control, and the judgement which was soon to come, Felix became alarmed and said, "For the present leave me, and when I can find a convenient opportunity I will send for you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.26" type="verse">At the same time he hoped that Paul would give him money; and for this reason he sent for him the oftener to converse with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.24.27" type="verse">But after the lapse of fully two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and being desirous of gratifying the Jews, Felix left Paul still  in prison.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.25" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.1" type="verse">Festus, having entered on his duties as governor of the province, two days later went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.2" type="verse">The High Priests and the leading men among the Jews immediately made representations to him against Paul, and begged him--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.3" type="verse">asking it as a favour, to Paul's prejudice--to have him brought to Jerusalem. They were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.4" type="verse">Festus, however, replied that Paul was in custody  in Caesarea, and that he was himself going there very soon.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.5" type="verse">"Therefore let those of you," he said, "who can come, go down with me, and impeach the man, if there is anything amiss in him."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.6" type="verse">After a stay of eight or ten days in Jerusalem--not more--he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, taking his seat on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.7" type="verse">Upon Paul's arrival, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood round him, and brought many grave charges against him which they were unable to substantiate.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.8" type="verse">But, in reply, Paul said, "Neither against the Jewish Law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar, have I committed any offence whatever."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.9" type="verse">Then Festus, being anxious to gratify the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there  stand your trial before me on these charges?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.10" type="verse">"I am standing before Caesar's tribunal," replied Paul, "where alone I ought to be tried. The Jews have no real ground of complaint against me, as in fact you yourself are beginning to see more clearly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.11" type="verse">If, however, I have done wrong and have committed any offence for which I deserve to die, I do not ask to be excused that penalty. But if there is no truth in what these men allege against me, no one has the right to give me up to them as a favour. I appeal to Caesar."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.12" type="verse">Then, after conferring with the Council, Festus replied, "To Caesar you have appealed: to Caesar you shall go."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.13" type="verse">A short time after this, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay a complimentary visit to Festus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.14" type="verse">and, during their rather long stay, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. "There is a man here," he said, "whom Felix left a prisoner,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.15" type="verse">about whom, when I went to Jerusalem, the High Priests and the Elders of the Jews made representations to me, begging that sentence might be pronounced against him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.16" type="verse">My reply was that it is not the custom among the Romans to give up any one for punishment before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity of defending himself against the charge which has been brought against him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.17" type="verse">"When, therefore, a number of them came here, the next day I took my seat on the tribunal, without any loss of time, and ordered the man to be brought in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.18" type="verse">But, when his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with the misdemeanours of which I had been suspecting him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.19" type="verse">But they quarrelled with him about certain matters connected with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but--so Paul persistently maintained--is now alive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.20" type="verse">I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, and asked Paul whether he would care to go to Jerusalem and there stand his trial on these matters.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.21" type="verse">But when Paul appealed to have his case kept for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in prison until I could send him up to Caesar."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.22" type="verse">"I should like to hear the man myself," said Agrippa. "to-morrow," replied Festus, "you shall." Accordingly, the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came in state</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.23" type="verse">and took their seats in the Judgement Hall, attended by the Tribunes and the men of high rank in the city; and, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.24" type="verse">Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see here the man about whom the whole nation of the Jews made suit to me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.25" type="verse">I could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved to die; but as he has himself appealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.26" type="verse">I have nothing very definite, however, to tell our Sovereign about him. So I have brought the man before you all--and especially before you, King Agrippa--that after he has been examined I may find something which I can put into writing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.25.27" type="verse">For, when sending a prisoner to Rome, it seems to me to be absurd not to state the charges against him."</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.26" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.1" type="verse">Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak about yourself." So Paul, with outstretched arm, proceeded to make his defence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.2" type="verse">"As regards all the accusations brought against me by the Jews," he said,  "I think myself fortunate, King Agrippa, in being about to defend myself to-day before  you,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.3" type="verse">who are so familiar with all the customs and speculations that prevail among the Jews; and for this reason, I pray you, give me a patient hearing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.4" type="verse">"The kind of life I have lived from my youth upwards, as exemplified in my early days among my nation and in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.5" type="verse">For they all know me of old--if they would but testify to the fact--how, being an adherent of the strictest sect of our religion, my life was that of a Pharisee.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.6" type="verse">And now I stand here impeached  because of my hope in the fulfilment of the promise made by God to our forefathers--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.7" type="verse">the promise which our twelve tribes, worshipping day and night with intense devotedness, hope to have made good to them. It is on the subject of this hope,  Sir, that I am accused by the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.8" type="verse">Why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if God raises the dead to life?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.9" type="verse">"I myself, however, thought it a duty to do many things in hostility to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.10" type="verse">And that was how I acted in Jerusalem. Armed with authority received from the High Priests I shut up many of  God's people in various prisons, and when they were about to be put to death I gave my vote against them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.11" type="verse">In all the synagogues also I punished them many a time, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury I chased them even to foreign towns.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.12" type="verse">"While thus engaged, I was travelling one day to Damascus armed with authority and a commission from the High Priests,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.13" type="verse">and on the journey, at noon, Sir, I saw a light from Heaven--brighter than the brightness of the sun--shining around me and around those who were travelling with me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.14" type="verse">We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice which said to me in Hebrew, "`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are finding it painful to kick against the ox-goad.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.15" type="verse">"`Who art Thou, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.16" type="verse">`But rise, and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you My servant and My witness both as to the things you have already seen and as to those in which I will appear to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.17" type="verse">I will save you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles,  to whom I send you to open their eyes,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.18" type="verse">that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience to Satan to God, in order to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through faith in Me.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.19" type="verse">"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.20" type="verse">but I proceeded to preach first to the people in Damascus, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God, and live lives consistent with such repentance.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.21" type="verse">"It was on this account that the Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.22" type="verse">Having, however, obtained the help which is from God, I have stood firm until now, and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike, saying nothing except what the Prophets and Moses predicted as soon to happen,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.23" type="verse">since the Christ was to be a suffering Christ, and by coming back from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message of light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.24" type="verse">As Paul thus made his defence, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, "You are raving mad, Paul; and great learning is driving you mad."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.25" type="verse">"I am not mad, most noble Festus," replied Paul; "I am speaking words of sober truth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.26" type="verse">For the King, to whom I speak freely, knows about these matters. I am not to be persuaded that any detail of them  has escaped his notice; for these things have not been done in a corner.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.27" type="verse">King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe them."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.28" type="verse">Agrippa answered,  "In brief, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.29" type="verse">"My prayer to God, whether  briefly or at length," replied Paul, "would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to-day, might become such as I am--except these chains."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.30" type="verse">So the King rose, and the Governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.31" type="verse">and, having withdrawn, they talked to one another and said, "This man is doing nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.26.32" type="verse">And Agrippa said to Festus, "He might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar."</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.27" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.1" type="verse">Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed over Paul and a few other prisoners into the custody of Julius, a Captain of the Augustan battalion;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.2" type="verse">and going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, the Macedonian, from Thessalonica, forming one of our party.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.3" type="verse">The next day we put in at Sidon. There Julius treated Paul with thoughtful kindness and allowed him to visit his friends and profit by their generous care.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.4" type="verse">Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were  against us;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.5" type="verse">and, sailing the whole length of the sea that lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached  Myra in Lycia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.6" type="verse">There Julius found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy, and put us on board of her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.7" type="verse">It took several days of slow sailing for us to come with difficulty off Cnidus; from which point, as the wind did not allow us to get on in the direct course, we ran under the lee of Crete  by Salmone.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.8" type="verse">Then, coasting along with difficulty, we reached a place called `Fair Havens,' near the town of Lasea.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.9" type="verse">Our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time, and the navigation being now unsafe and  the Fast also already over, Paul warned them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.10" type="verse">"Sirs," he said, "I perceive that before long the voyage will be attended with danger and heavy loss, not only to the cargo and the ship but to our own lives also."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.11" type="verse">But Julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner rather than by Paul's arguments;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.12" type="verse">and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in, the majority were in favour of putting out to sea, to try whether they could get to Phoenix--a harbour on the coast of Crete  facing north-east and south-east--to winter there.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.13" type="verse">And a light breeze from the south sprang up, so that they supposed they  were now sure of their purpose. So weighing anchor they ran along the coast of Crete, hugging the shore.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.14" type="verse">But it was not long before  a furious north-east wind, coming  down from the mountains,  burst upon us and carried the ship out of her course.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.15" type="verse">She was unable to make headway against the gale; so we gave up and let her drive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.16" type="verse">Then we ran under the lee of a little island called  Cauda, where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.17" type="verse">and, after hoisting it on board, they used frapping-cables  to undergird the ship, and, as they were afraid of being driven on the Syrtis quicksands, they lowered the gear and  lay to.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.18" type="verse">But, as the storm was still violent, the next day they began to lighten the ship;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.19" type="verse">and, on the third day, with their own hands they threw the ship's spare gear overboard.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.20" type="verse">Then, when for several days neither sun nor stars were seen and the terrific gale still harassed us, the last ray of hope was now vanishing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.21" type="verse">When for a long time they had taken but little food, Paul, standing up among them, said, "Sirs, you ought to have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would then have escaped this suffering and loss.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.22" type="verse">But now take courage, for there will be no destruction of life among you, but of the ship only.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.23" type="verse">For there stood by my side, last night, an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom also I worship,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.24" type="verse">and he said, "`Dismiss all fear, Paul, for you must stand before Caesar; and God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.25" type="verse">"Therefore, Sirs, take courage; for I believe God, and am convinced that things will happen exactly as I have been told.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.26" type="verse">But we are to be stranded on a certain island."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.27" type="verse">It was now the fourteenth night, and we were  drifting through  the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected that land was close at hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.28" type="verse">So they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water; and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.29" type="verse">Then for fear of possibly running on rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern and  waited impatiently for daylight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.30" type="verse">The sailors, however, wanted to make their escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.31" type="verse">But Paul, addressing Julius and the soldiers, said, "Your lives will be sacrificed, unless these men remain on board."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.32" type="verse">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship's boat and let her fall off.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.33" type="verse">And continually, up till daybreak, Paul kept urging all on board to take some food. "This is the fourteenth day," he said, "that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease, and have fasted, eating little or nothing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.34" type="verse">I therefore strongly advise you to take some food. This is essential for your safety. For not a hair will perish from the head of any one of you."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.35" type="verse">Having said this he took some bread, and, after giving thanks to God for it before them all, he broke it in pieces and began to eat it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.36" type="verse">This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.37" type="verse">There were  276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.38" type="verse">After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.39" type="verse">When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast. But an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention, and now  their object was, if possible, to run the ship aground  in this inlet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.40" type="verse">So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea, unloosing at the same time the bands which secured the  paddle-rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.41" type="verse">But coming to a place where two seas met, they stranded the ship, and her bow sticking fast remained immovable, while the stern began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.42" type="verse">Now the soldiers recommended that the prisoners should be killed, for fear some one of them might swim ashore and effect his escape.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.43" type="verse">But their Captain, bent on securing Paul's safety, kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.27.44" type="verse">and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. In this way they all  got safely to land.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.ACT.28" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.1" type="verse">Our lives having been thus preserved, we discovered that the island was called  Malta.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.2" type="verse">The strange-speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness, for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of the pelting rain and the cold.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.3" type="verse">Now, when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown them on the fire, a viper, driven by the heat, came out and fastened itself on his hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.4" type="verse">When the natives saw the creature hanging to his hand, they said to one another, "Beyond doubt this man is a murderer, for, though saved from the sea, unerring Justice does not permit him to live."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.5" type="verse">He, however, shook the reptile off into the fire and was unhurt.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.6" type="verse">They expected him soon to swell with inflammation or suddenly fall down dead; but, after waiting a long time and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.7" type="verse">Now in the same part of the island there were estates belonging to the Governor, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us to his house, and for three days generously made us his guests.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.8" type="verse">It happened, however, that his father was lying ill of dysentery aggravated by attacks of fever; so Paul went to see him, and, after praying, laid his hands on him and cured him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.9" type="verse">After this, all the other sick people in the island came and were cured.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.10" type="verse">They also loaded us with honours, and when at last we sailed they put supplies on board for us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.11" type="verse">Three months passed before we set sail in an Alexandrian vessel,  called the `Twin Brothers,' which had wintered at the island.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.12" type="verse">At Syracuse we put in and stayed for  two days.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.13" type="verse">From there we  came round and reached Rhegium; and a day later, a south wind sprang up which brought us by the evening of the next day to Puteoli.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.14" type="verse">Here we found brethren, who invited us to remain with them for a week; and so we reached Rome.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.15" type="verse">Meanwhile the brethren there, hearing of our movements, came as far as  the Market of Appius and the Three Huts to meet us; and when Paul saw them he thanked God and felt encouraged.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.16" type="verse">Upon our arrival  in Rome, Paul received permission to live  by himself, guarded by a soldier.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.17" type="verse">After  one complete day he invited the leading men among the Jews to meet him; and, when they were come together, he said to them, "As for me, brethren, although I had done nothing prejudicial to our people or contrary to the customs of our forefathers, I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the power of the Romans.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.18" type="verse">They, after they had sharply questioned me, were willing to set me at liberty, because they found no offence in me for which I deserve to die.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.19" type="verse">But,  at last, the opposition of the Jews compelled me to appeal to Caesar; not however that I had any charge to bring against my nation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.20" type="verse">For these reasons, then, I have invited you here, that I might see you and speak to you; for it is for the sake of  Him who is the hope of Israel that this chain hangs  upon me."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.21" type="verse">"For our part," they replied, "we have not received any letters from Judaea about you, nor have any of our countrymen come here and reported or stated anything to your disadvantage.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.22" type="verse">But we should be glad to hear from you what it is that you believe; for as for this sect all we know is that it is everywhere spoken against."</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.23" type="verse">So they arranged a day with him and came to him in  considerable numbers  at the house of the friends who were entertaining him. And then, with solemn earnestness, he explained to them the subject of the Kingdom of God, endeavouring from morning till evening to convince them about Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.24" type="verse">Some were convinced; others refused to believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.25" type="verse">Unable to agree among themselves, they at last left him, but not before Paul had spoken a parting word to them, saying, "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your forefathers through the Prophet Isaiah:</seg>
          <seg id="b.ACT.28.26" type="verse">&amp;lt;"`Go to this people and tell them, you will hear and hear, and by no means understand; and will look and look, and by no means see.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ACT.28.28" type="verse">"Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation--God's salvation--has now been sent to the Gentiles, and that they, at any rate, will give heed."</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.1.17" type="verse">For in the Good News  a righteousness which comes from God is being revealed, depending on faith and tending to produce faith; as the Scripture has it,  &amp;lt;"The righteous man shall live by faith."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.18" type="verse">For God's anger is being revealed from Heaven against all impiety and against the iniquity of men who through iniquity suppress the truth. God is angry:</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.19" type="verse">because what may be known about Him is plain  to their inmost consciousness; for He Himself has made it plain to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.20" type="verse">For, from the very creation of the world, His invisible perfections--namely His eternal power and divine nature--have been rendered intelligible and clearly visible by His works,  so that these men are without excuse.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.21" type="verse">For when they had come to know God, they did not give Him glory as God nor render Him thanks, but they became absorbed in useless discussions, and their senseless minds were darkened.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.22" type="verse">While boasting of their wisdom they became  utter fools,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.23" type="verse">and,  instead of worshipping the imperishable God, they worshipped images resembling perishable man or resembling birds or beasts or reptiles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.24" type="verse">For this reason, in accordance with  their own depraved cravings, God gave them up to uncleanness, allowing them to dishonour their bodies among themselves with impurity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.25" type="verse">For they had bartered the reality of God for  what is unreal, and had offered divine honours and religious service to created things, rather than to the Creator--He who is for ever blessed. Amen.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.26" type="verse">This then is the reason why God gave them up to vile passions. For not only did the women among them exchange the natural use of their bodies for one which is contrary to nature, but the men also,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.27" type="verse">in just the same way--neglecting that for which nature intends women--burned with passion towards one another, men practising shameful vice with men, and receiving in their own selves the reward which necessarily followed their misconduct.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.28" type="verse">And just as they had refused to continue to have a full knowledge of God, so it was to utterly worthless minds that God gave them up, for them to do things which should not be done.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.29" type="verse">Their hearts overflowed with all sorts of dishonesty, mischief, greed,  malice. They were full of envy and murder, and were quarrelsome, crafty, and spiteful.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.30" type="verse">They were secret backbiters, open slanderers;  hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful; inventors of new forms of sin, disobedient to parents, destitute of common sense,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.31" type="verse">faithless to their promises, without natural affection, without human pity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.1.32" type="verse">In short, though knowing full well the sentence which God pronounces against  actions such as theirs, as things which deserve death, they not only  practise them, but even  encourage and applaud others who do them.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.4.9" type="verse">This declaration of blessedness, then, does it come simply to the circumcised, or to the uncircumcised as well? For &amp;lt;Abraham's faith&amp;gt;--so we affirm--&amp;lt;was placed to his credit as righteousness.&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.10" type="verse">What then were the circumstances under which this took place? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before?</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.11" type="verse">Before, not after. And he received  circumcision as a sign, a mark attesting the reality of the faith-righteousness which was his while still uncircumcised, that he might be the forefather of all those who believe even though they are uncircumcised--in order that this righteousness might be placed to their credit;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.12" type="verse">and the forefather of the circumcised, namely of those who not merely are circumcised, but also walk in the steps of the faith which our forefather Abraham had while he was as yet uncircumcised.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.13" type="verse">Again, the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his posterity conditioned by Law, but by faith-righteousness.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.4.16" type="verse">All depends on faith, and for this reason--that  acceptance with God might be an act of pure grace,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.17" type="verse">so that the promise should be made sure to all Abraham's true descendants; not merely to those who are righteous through the Law, but to those who are righteous through a faith like that of Abraham. Thus in the sight of God in whom he believed, who gives life to  the dead and makes reference to things that do not exist, as though they did, Abraham is the forefather of  all of us. As it is written, &amp;lt;"I have appointed you to be the forefather of many nations."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.4.18" type="verse">Under utterly hopeless circumstances he hopefully believed, so that he might become the forefather of many nations, in agreement with the words &amp;lt;"Equally numerous shall your posterity be."&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.4.20" type="verse">Nor did he in unbelief stagger at God's promise, but became mighty in faith, giving glory to God,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.5.12" type="verse">What follows? This comparison. Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and so death passed to all mankind in turn, in that all sinned.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.13" type="verse">For prior to the Law sin was already in the world; only it is not  entered in the account against us when no Law exists.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.5.15" type="verse">But God's free gift immeasurably outweighs the  transgression. For if through the transgression of the one individual  the mass of mankind have died, infinitely greater is the generosity with which God's grace, and the gift given in His grace which found expression in the one man Jesus Christ, have been bestowed on the mass of mankind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.16" type="verse">And it is not with the gift as it was with the results of one individual's sin; for the judgement which one individual provoked resulted in condemnation, whereas the free gift after a multitude of transgressions results in acquittal.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.17" type="verse">For if, through the transgression of the one individual, Death made use of the one individual to seize the sovereignty, all the more shall those who receive God's overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in Life through the one individual, Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.18" type="verse">It follows then that just as the result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a  life-giving  acquittal which  extends to the whole race.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.19" type="verse">For as through the disobedience of the one individual the mass of mankind were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the mass of mankind will be constituted righteous.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.20" type="verse">Now Law was brought in later on, so  that transgression might increase. But where sin increased, grace  has overflowed;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.5.21" type="verse">in order that as sin has exercised kingly sway in inflicting death, so grace, too,  may exercise kingly sway in bestowing a righteousness which results in the Life of the Ages through Jesus Christ our Lord.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.7.2" type="verse">A wife, for instance, whose husband is living is bound to him by the Law; but if her husband dies  the law that bound her to him has now no hold over her.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.3" type="verse">This accounts for the fact that if during her husband's life she lives with another man, she will be stigmatized as an adulteress; but that if her husband is dead she is  no longer under the old prohibition, and even though she marries again, she is not an adulteress.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.4" type="verse">So, my brethren,  to  you also the Law died through the  incarnation of Christ, that you might be wedded to Another, namely to Him who rose from the dead in order that  we might yield fruit to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.5" type="verse">For whilst we were under the thraldom of our earthly natures, sinful passions--  made sinful by the Law--were always  being aroused to action in our bodily faculties that they might yield fruit to death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.6" type="verse">But seeing that we have died to that which once held us in bondage,  the Law has now no hold over us, so that we render a service which, instead of being old and  formal, is new and spiritual.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.7" type="verse">What follows? Is the Law itself a sinful thing? No, indeed; on the contrary, unless I had been taught by the Law, I  should have known nothing of sin as sin. For instance, I should not have known what covetousness is, if the Law had not  repeatedly said, &amp;lt;"Thou shalt not covet."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.8" type="verse">Sin took advantage of this, and by means of  the Commandment stirred up within me  every kind of coveting; for apart from Law sin would be dead.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.7.11" type="verse">For sin seized the advantage, and by means of the Commandment it completely deceived me, and  also put me to death.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.7.13" type="verse">Did then a thing which is good become death to me? No, indeed, but sin did; so that through its bringing about death by means of what was good, it might be seen in its true light as sin, in order that by means of the Commandment the unspeakable sinfulness of sin might be plainly shown.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.14" type="verse">For we know that the Law is a spiritual thing; but I am unspiritual--the slave, bought and sold, of sin.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.7.18" type="verse">For I know that in me, that is, in my  lower self, nothing good has its home; for while the will to do right  is present with me, the power to carry it out is not.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.19" type="verse">For what I do is not the good thing that I desire to do; but the evil thing that I desire not to do, is what I constantly do.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.7.20" type="verse">But if I do that which I desire not to do, it can no longer be said that it is I who do it, but the sin which has its home within me does it.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.8.3" type="verse">For what was impossible to the Law--powerless as it was because it acted through frail  humanity--God effected. Sending His own Son in a body like that of sinful  human nature and as a sacrifice for sin, He  pronounced  sentence upon sin in human nature;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.4" type="verse">in order that in our case the requirements of the Law might be fully met. For our lives are regulated not by our earthly, but by our spiritual natures.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.5" type="verse">For if men are controlled by their earthly natures, they give their minds to earthly things. If they are controlled by their spiritual natures, they give their minds to spiritual things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.6" type="verse">Because for the mind to be given up to earthly things means death; but for it to be given up to spiritual things means Life and peace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.7" type="verse">Abandonment to earthly things is a state of enmity to God. Such a mind does not submit to God's Law, and indeed cannot do so.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.8.9" type="verse">You, however, are not devoted to earthly, but to spiritual things, if the Spirit of God is really dwelling in you; whereas if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, such a one does not belong to Him.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.8.23" type="verse">And more than that,  we ourselves, though we possess the Spirit as a foretaste and pledge of the glorious future, yet we ourselves inwardly sigh, as we wait and long for open recognition as sons through the  deliverance of our bodies.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.24" type="verse">It is *in hope* that we have been saved. But  an object of hope is such no longer when it is present to view;  for when a man has a thing before his eyes, how can he be said to hope for it?</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.8.26" type="verse">In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what prayers to offer nor in what way to offer them. But the Spirit Himself pleads for us in yearnings that can find no words,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.8.27" type="verse">and the Searcher of hearts knows what the Spirit's meaning is,  because His intercessions for God's people are in harmony with God's will.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.8.29" type="verse">For those whom He has  known beforehand He has also pre-destined to bear the likeness of His Son, that He might be the Eldest in a vast family of brothers;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.10.3" type="verse">Ignorant of the righteousness which God provides and  building their hopes upon a  righteousness of their own, they have refused submission to God's righteousness.</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.10.5" type="verse">Moses  says that he whose actions conform to the righteousness required by the Law shall live by that righteousness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.10.6" type="verse">But the righteousness which is based on faith speaks in a different tone. "Say not in your heart," it declares, "`Who shall ascend to Heaven?'" --that is, to bring Christ down;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.15.7" type="verse">Habitually therefore give one another a friendly reception, just as Christ also has received you, and thus promote the glory of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.8" type="verse">My meaning is that Christ has become  a servant to the people of Israel in vindication of God's truthfulness--  in showing how sure are the promises made to our forefathers--</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.9" type="verse">and that the Gentiles also have glorified God in acknowledgment of His mercy. So it is written, &amp;lt;"For this reason I will praise Thee among the Gentiles, and sing psalms in honour of Thy name."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.10" type="verse">And again the Psalmist says, &amp;lt;"Be glad, ye Gentiles, in company with His People."&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.15.14" type="verse">But as to you, brethren, I am convinced--  yes, I Paul am convinced--that, even apart from my teaching, you are already full of goodness of heart, and enriched with complete Christian knowledge, and are also competent to instruct one another.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.15" type="verse">But I write to you the more boldly--partly as reminding you of what you already know--because of the  authority graciously entrusted to me by God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.16" type="verse">that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles, doing priestly duties in connexion with God's Good News so that the sacrifice--namely the Gentiles--may be acceptable to Him, being (as it is) an offering which the Holy Spirit has made holy.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.17" type="verse">I can therefore glory in Christ Jesus concerning the work for God in which I am engaged.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.18" type="verse">For I will not presume to mention any of the results that Christ has brought about by other agency than mine in securing the obedience of the Gentiles by word or deed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.19" type="verse">with power manifested in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit.  But--to speak simply of my own labours--beginning in Jerusalem and the outlying districts, I  have proclaimed without reserve, even as far as Illyricum, the Good News of the Christ;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.20" type="verse">making it my ambition, however, not to tell the Good News where Christ's name was already known, for fear I should be building on another man's foundation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.21" type="verse">But, as Scripture says, &amp;lt;"Those shall see, to whom no report about Him has hitherto come, and those who until now have not heard shall understand."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.22" type="verse">And it is really  this which has again and again prevented my coming to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.23" type="verse">But now, as there is no more unoccupied ground in this part of the world, and I have for years past been eager to pay you a visit,</seg>

          <seg id="b.ROM.15.25" type="verse">But at present I am going to Jerusalem to serve God's people,</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.26" type="verse">for Macedonia and Greece have kindly contributed a certain sum in relief of the poor among God's people, in Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.27" type="verse">Yes, they have kindly done this, and, in fact, it was a debt they owed them. For seeing that the Gentiles have been admitted in to partnership with the Jews in their spiritual blessings, they in turn are under an obligation to render sacred service to the Jews in temporal things.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.28" type="verse">So after  discharging this duty, and making sure that these kind gifts reach  those for whom they are intended, I shall start for Spain, passing through Rome on my way there;</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.29" type="verse">and I know that when I come to you it will be with a vast amount of blessing from Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.ROM.15.30" type="verse">But I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love which His Spirit inspires, to help me by wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf,</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.1.6" type="verse">Thus my testimony as to the Christ has been confirmed in your experience,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.7" type="verse">so that there is no gift of God in which you  consciously come short while patiently waiting for the reappearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.8" type="verse">who will also keep you stedfast to the very End, so that you will be free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.9" type="verse">God is ever true to His promises, and it was by Him that you were, one and all, called  into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.10" type="verse">Now I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to  cultivate a spirit of harmony--all of you--and that there be no divisions among you, but rather a perfect union through your having one mind and one judgement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.11" type="verse">For I have been distinctly informed, my brethren, about you by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.12" type="verse">What I mean is that each of you is a partisan. One man says "I belong to Paul;" another "I belong to Apollos;" a third "I belong to  Peter;" a fourth "I belong to Christ."</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.13" type="verse">Is the Christ  in fragments? Is it Paul who was crucified on your behalf? Or were you baptized  to be Paul's adherents?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.14" type="verse">I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius--</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.1.18" type="verse">For  the Message of the Cross is  foolishness to those who are on the way to perdition, but it is the power of God to those whom He is saving.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.19" type="verse">For so it stands written, &amp;lt;"I will exhibit the nothingness of the wisdom of  the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought."&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.1.21" type="verse">For after the world by its wisdom--as God in His wisdom had ordained--had failed to gain the knowledge of God, God was pleased, by the apparent foolishness of the Message which we preach, to save those who accepted it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.22" type="verse">Seeing that Jews demand  miracles, and Greeks go in search of wisdom,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.23" type="verse">while we proclaim a Christ who has been crucified--to the Jews a stumbling-block, to Gentiles foolishness,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.24" type="verse">but to those who have received the Call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.25" type="verse">Because that which the world deems foolish in God is wiser than men's wisdom, and that which it deems feeble in God is mightier than men's might.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.26" type="verse">For consider, brethren, God's call to you.  Not many who are wise with merely human wisdom, not many of position and influence, not many of noble birth have been called.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.27" type="verse">But God has chosen the things which the world regards as foolish, in order to put its wise men to shame; and God has chosen the things which the world regards as destitute of influence, in order to put its powerful things to shame;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.1.28" type="verse">and the things which the world regards as base, and those which it sets utterly at nought--things  that have no existence--God has chosen in order to reduce to nothing things that do exist;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.1.30" type="verse">But you--and it is all God's doing--are in Christ Jesus: He has become for us a wisdom which is from God, consisting of righteousness and sanctification and  deliverance;</seg>

        <div id="b.1CO.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.1" type="verse">And as for myself, brethren, when I came to you, it was not with surpassing power of eloquence or earthly wisdom that I came, announcing to you  that which God had commanded me to bear witness to.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.2" type="verse">For I determined to be utterly ignorant, when among you, of everything except of Jesus Christ, and of Him as having been crucified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.3" type="verse">And so far as I myself was concerned, I came to you  in conscious feebleness and in fear and in deep anxiety.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.4" type="verse">And my language and the Message that I proclaimed were not adorned with persuasive words of earthly wisdom, but depended upon truths which the Spirit taught and mightily carried home;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.2.8" type="verse">a wisdom which not one of the leaders of the present age  possesses, for if they had  possessed it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.9" type="verse">But--to use the words of Scripture--we speak of &amp;lt;things which eye has not seen nor ear heard,&amp;gt; and which have never entered the heart of man: &amp;lt;all that God has in readiness for them that love Him.&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.10" type="verse">For us, however, God has drawn aside the veil through the teaching of the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, including the depths of the divine nature.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.11" type="verse">For, among human beings, who knows a man's inner thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? In the same way, also, only God's Spirit is acquainted with God's inner thoughts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.12" type="verse">But we have not received  the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes forth from God, that we may know the blessings that have been so freely given to us by God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.13" type="verse">Of these we speak--not in language which man's wisdom teaches us, but in that which the Spirit teaches--adapting, as we do, spiritual words to spiritual  truths.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.14" type="verse">The  unspiritual man rejects the  things of the Spirit of God, and cannot attain to the knowledge of them, because they are spiritually judged.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.15" type="verse">But the spiritual man judges of everything, although he is himself judged by no one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.2.16" type="verse">For &amp;lt;who has penetrated the mind of the Lord, and will instruct Him?&amp;gt; But *we* have the mind of Christ.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.3.4" type="verse">For when some one says, "I belong to Paul," and another says, "I belong to Apollos," is not this the way men of the world speak?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.3.5" type="verse">What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are just God's servants, through whose efforts, and as the Lord granted power to each, you accepted the faith.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.4.3" type="verse">I however am very little concerned at undergoing your scrutiny, or that of other men; in fact I do not even scrutinize myself.</seg>

He will  both bring to light the secrets of darkness and will openly disclose the motives that have been in people's hearts; and then the praise which each man deserves will come to him from God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.4.9" type="verse">God, it seems to me, has  exhibited us Apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; for we have come to be a spectacle to all creation--alike to angels and to men.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.7.2" type="verse">But because there is so much fornication every man should have a wife of his own, and every woman should have a husband.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.3" type="verse">Let a man pay his wife her due, and let a woman also pay her husband his.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.4" type="verse">A married woman is not mistress of her own person: her husband has certain rights. In the same way a married man is not master of his own person: his wife has certain rights.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.5" type="verse">Do not refuse one another, unless perhaps it is just for a time and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer and may then associate again; lest the Adversary begin to tempt you because of your deficiency in self-control.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.6" type="verse">Thus much in the way of concession, not of command.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.7" type="verse">Yet I would that everybody lived as I do; but each of us has his own special gift from God--one in one direction and one in another.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.8" type="verse">But I tell the unmarried, and women who are widows, that it is well for them to remain as I am.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.9" type="verse">If, however, they cannot maintain self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.10" type="verse">But to those already married my instructions are--yet not mine, but the Lord's--that a wife is not to leave her husband;</seg>

Otherwise your children would be unholy, but in reality they have a place among God's people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.15" type="verse">If, however, the unbeliever  is determined to leave, let him or her do so. Under such circumstances the Christian man or woman is no slave; God  has called us  to live lives of peace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.16" type="verse">For what assurance have you, O woman, as to whether  you will save your husband? Or what assurance have you, O man, as to whether you will save your wife?</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.7.18" type="verse">This is what I command in all the Churches. Was any one already circumcised when called? Let him not have recourse to the surgeons. Was any one uncircumcised when called? Let him remain uncircumcised.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.19" type="verse">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: obedience to God's commandments is everything.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.20" type="verse">Whatever be the  condition in life in which a man was, when he was called, in that let him continue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.21" type="verse">Were you a slave when God called you? Let not that weigh on your mind. And yet if you can get your freedom, take advantage of the opportunity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.22" type="verse">For  a Christian, if he was a slave when called, is the Lord's freed man, and in the same way a free man, if called, becomes the slave of Christ.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.7.31" type="verse">and those who use the world as not using it to the full. For the world as it now exists is passing away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.32" type="verse">And I would have you free from worldly anxiety. An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord's business--how he shall please the Lord;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.7.34" type="verse">There is a difference too between a married and an unmarried woman. She who is unmarried concerns herself with the Lord's business--that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman concerns herself with the business of the world--how she shall please her husband.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.35" type="verse">Thus much I say in your own interest; not to lay a trap for you, but to help towards what is becoming, and enable you to wait on the Lord without distraction.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.36" type="verse">If, however, a father thinks he is acting unbecomingly towards his still unmarried daughter if she be past the bloom of her youth, and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires; he commits no sin;  she and her suitor should be allowed to marry.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.37" type="verse">But if a father stands firm in his resolve, being free from all external constraint and having a legal right to act as he pleases, and in his own mind has come to the decision to keep his daughter unmarried, he will do well.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.38" type="verse">So that he who gives his daughter in marriage does well, and yet he who does not give her in marriage will do better.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.7.39" type="verse">A woman is bound to her husband during the whole period that he lives; but if her husband  dies, she is at liberty to marry whom she will, provided that he is a Christian.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.14.8" type="verse">If the bugle--to take another example--gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.9" type="verse">And so with you; if with the living voice you fail to utter intelligible words, how will people know what you are saying? You will be talking to the winds.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.10" type="verse">There are, we will suppose, a great number of languages in the world, and no creature is without a language.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.11" type="verse">If, however, I do not know the meaning of the particular language, I shall seem to the speaker of it, and he to me, to be merely talking some foreign tongue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.12" type="verse">Therefore, seeing that you are ambitious for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in them so as to  benefit the Church.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.13" type="verse">Therefore let a man who has the gift of tongues pray for the power of interpreting them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.14" type="verse">For if I pray in an unknown tongue,  my spirit prays, but my understanding is barren.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.15" type="verse">How then does the matter stand? I will pray in spirit, and I will pray with my understanding also. I will  praise God in spirit, and I will praise Him with my understanding also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.16" type="verse">Otherwise, if you bless God in spirit only, how shall he who is in the position of an ungifted man say the `Amen' to your giving of thanks, when he does not know what your words mean?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.17" type="verse">Rightly enough you are giving thanks, and yet your neighbor is not  benefited.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.18" type="verse">I speak in a tongue, thank God, more than all of you;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.19" type="verse">but in the Church I would rather speak five words with my understanding--so as to instruct others also--than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.20" type="verse">Brethren, do not prove yourselves to be children in your minds. As regards evil, indeed, be utter babes, but as regards your minds prove yourselves to be men of ripe years.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.21" type="verse">In the Law it stands written, &amp;lt;"`By men of unknown tongues and by the lips of an unknown nation will I speak to this People, but even then they will not listen to Me',&amp;gt; says the Lord."</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.22" type="verse">This shows that the gift of tongues is intended as a sign not to those who believe but to unbelievers, but  prophecy is intended not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.23" type="verse">Accordingly if the whole Church has assembled and all are speaking in `tongues,' and there come in ungifted men, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are all mad?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.24" type="verse">If, on the other hand, every one is prophesying and an unbeliever or an ungifted man comes in, he is convicted by all and closely examined by all,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.25" type="verse">and the hidden evils of his heart are brought to light. And, as the result, he will fall on his face and worship God, and will report to others that of a truth God is among you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.26" type="verse">What then, brethren? Whenever you assemble, there is not one of you who is not ready either with a song of praise, a sermon, a revelation, a `tongue,' or an interpretation. Let everything be done with a view to the  building up of faith and character.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.27" type="verse">If there is speaking in an unknown tongue, only two or at the most three should speak, and they should do so one at a time, and one should interpret;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.28" type="verse">or if there is no interpreter, let the man with the gift be silent in the Church, speaking to himself and to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.29" type="verse">But if there are Prophets, let two or three speak and let the rest  judge.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.30" type="verse">And if anything is revealed to some one else who is  seated there, let the first be silent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.31" type="verse">For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged:</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.32" type="verse">and the spirits of Prophets yield submission to Prophets.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.33" type="verse">For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace,  as He is in all the Churches of His people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.34" type="verse">Let  married women be silent in the Churches, for they are not permitted to speak. They must be content with a subordinate place, as the Law also says;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.35" type="verse">and if they wish to ask questions, they should ask  their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a married woman to speak at a Church assembly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.36" type="verse">Was it from you that God's Message first went forth, or is it to you only that it has come?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.37" type="verse">If any one deems himself to be a Prophet or a man with spiritual gifts,  let him recognize as the Lord's command all that I am now writing to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.38" type="verse">But if any one is ignorant,  let him be ignorant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.39" type="verse">The conclusion, my brethren, is this. Be earnestly ambitious to prophesy, and do not check speaking with tongues;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.14.40" type="verse">only let everything be done in a becoming and orderly manner.</seg>

        <div id="b.1CO.15" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.1" type="verse">But let me recall to you, brethren, the Good News which I brought you, which you accepted, and on which you are standing,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.2" type="verse">through which also you are obtaining salvation, if you bear in mind the words in which I proclaimed it--unless indeed your faith has been unreal  from the very first.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.3" type="verse">For I repeated to you the all-important fact which also I had been taught, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.4" type="verse">that He was buried; that He rose to life again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.5" type="verse">and was seen by  Peter, and then by the Twelve.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.6" type="verse">Afterwards He was seen by more than five hundred brethren  at once, most of whom are still alive, although some of them have now fallen asleep.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.7" type="verse">Afterwards He was seen by James, and then by all the Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.8" type="verse">And last of all, as to one of untimely birth, He appeared to me also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.9" type="verse">For I am  the least of the Apostles, and am not fit to be called an Apostle--because I persecuted the Church of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.10" type="verse">But what I am I am by the grace of God, and His grace bestowed upon me did not prove ineffectual. But I labored more strenuously than all the rest--yet it was not I, but God's grace working with me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.11" type="verse">But whether it is I or they, this is the way we preach and the way that you came to believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.12" type="verse">But if Christ is preached as having risen from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.13" type="verse">If there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then Christ Himself has not risen to life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.14" type="verse">And if Christ has not risen, it follows that what we preach is a delusion, and that your faith also is  a delusion.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.15" type="verse">Nay more, we are actually being discovered to be bearing false witness about God, because we have testified that God raised Christ to life, whom He did not raise, if in reality none of the dead are raised.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.16" type="verse">For if none of the dead are raised to life, then Christ has not risen;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.17" type="verse">and if Christ has not risen, your faith is  a vain thing--you are still in your sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.18" type="verse">It follows also that those who  have fallen asleep in Christ  have perished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.19" type="verse">If in this present life we  have a *hope* resting on Christ,  and nothing more, we are more to be pitied than all the rest of the world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.20" type="verse">But, in reality, Christ *has* risen from among the dead, being the first to do so of those who are asleep.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.21" type="verse">For seeing that death came through man, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.22" type="verse">For just as through Adam all die, so also through Christ all will be made alive again.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.23" type="verse">But this will happen to each in the right order--Christ having been the first to rise, and afterwards Christ's people rising at His return.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.24" type="verse">Later on, comes  the End, when He is to surrender the Kingship  to God, the Father, when He shall have  overthrown all other government and all other authority and power.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.25" type="verse">For He must continue King until  He shall have put all His enemies under His feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.26" type="verse">The last enemy that is to be  overthrown is Death;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.27" type="verse">for He  will have put all things in subjection under His feet. And when He shall have declared that "All things  are in subjection," it will be with the manifest exception of Him who has reduced them all to subjection to Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.28" type="verse">But when the whole universe has been made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also become subject to Him who has made the universe subject to Him, in order that GOD may be  all in all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.29" type="verse">Otherwise  what will become of those who got themselves baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all,  why are these baptized for them?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.30" type="verse">Why also do  we Apostles expose ourselves to danger every hour?</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.31" type="verse">I protest, brethren, as surely as I glory over you--which I may justly do in Christ Jesus our Lord--that I die day by day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.32" type="verse">If from merely human motives I  have fought with  wild beasts in Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.33" type="verse">Do not deceive yourselves: "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.34" type="verse">Wake from this drunken fit; live righteous lives, and cease to sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak thus in order to move you to shame.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.15.36" type="verse">Foolish man! the seed you yourself sow has no life given to it unless it first dies;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.37" type="verse">and as for what you sow, it is not the plant which is to be that you are sowing, but a bare grain, of wheat (it may be) or of something else, and God gives it a body as He has seen fit,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.38" type="verse">and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.39" type="verse">All flesh is not the same: there is human flesh, and flesh of cattle, of birds, and of fishes.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1CO.15.42" type="verse">It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in a state of decay, it is raised free from decay;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.43" type="verse">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.44" type="verse">an  animal body is sown, a spiritual body is raised.  As surely as there is an animal body, so there is also a spiritual body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.45" type="verse">In the same way also it is written, &amp;lt;"The first man Adam became a living animal";&amp;gt; the last Adam is a life-giving Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.46" type="verse">Nevertheless, it is not what is spiritual that came first, but what is animal; what is spiritual came afterwards.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.47" type="verse">The first man is a man of earth, earthy; the second man is from Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.48" type="verse">What the earthy one is, that also are those who are earthy; and what the heavenly One is, that also are those who are heavenly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.49" type="verse">And as we have borne a resemblance to the earthy one, let us see to it that we also bear a resemblance to the heavenly One.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.50" type="verse">But this I tell you, brethren:  our mortal bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor will what is perishable inherit what is imperishable.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.51" type="verse">I tell you  a truth hitherto kept secret: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.52" type="verse">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sounding of  the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incapable of decay, and *we* shall be changed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.53" type="verse">For so it must be: this perishable nature must clothe itself with what is imperishable, and this mortality must clothe itself with immortality.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1CO.15.54" type="verse">But when this perishable nature has put on what is imperishable, and this mortality has put on immortality, then will the words of Scripture be fulfilled, &amp;lt;"Death has been swallowed up in victory."&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.1.17" type="verse">Did I display any  vacillation or caprice in this? Or the purposes which I form--do I form them on worldly principles, now crying "Yes, yes," and now "No, no"?</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.18" type="verse">As certainly as God is faithful, our language to you is not now "Yes" and now "No."</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.19" type="verse">For Jesus Christ the Son of God--He who was proclaimed among you by us, that is by  Silas and Timothy and myself--did not show Himself a waverer between "Yes" and "No." But it  was and always is "Yes" with Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.20" type="verse">For all the promises of God, whatever their number, have  their confirmation in Him; and for this reason through Him also our "Amen" acknowledges their truth  and promotes the glory of God through our faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.21" type="verse">But He who is making us as well as you stedfast through union with  the Anointed One, and has anointed us, is God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.22" type="verse">and He has also set His seal upon us, and has  put  His Spirit into our hearts as a pledge and foretaste of future blessing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.23" type="verse">But as for me, as my soul shall answer for it, I appeal to God as my witness, that it was to spare you pain that I gave up my visit to Corinth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.1.24" type="verse">Not that we want to lord it over you in respect of your faith--we do, however, desire to help your joy--for in the matter of your faith you are standing firm.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.2.1" type="verse">But, so far as I am concerned, I have resolved not to have a painful visit the next time I come to see you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.2" type="verse">For if I of all men give you pain, who then is there to gladden my heart, but the very persons to whom I give pain?</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.3" type="verse">And I write this to you in order that when I come I may not receive pain from those who ought to give me joy, confident as I am as to all of you that my joy is the joy of you all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.4" type="verse">For with many tears I write to you, and in deep suffering and depression of spirit, not in order to grieve you, but in the hope of showing you how brimful my heart is with love for you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.5" type="verse">Now if any one has caused sorrow, it has been caused not so much to me, as in some degree--for I have no wish to exaggerate--to all of you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.6" type="verse">In the case of such a person the punishment which was inflicted by the majority of you is enough.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.7" type="verse">So that you may now take the opposite course, and forgive him  rather and comfort him, for fear he should perhaps be driven to despair by his excess of grief.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.8" type="verse">I beg you therefore fully to reinstate him in your love.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.9" type="verse">For in writing to you I have also this object in view--to discover by experience whether you are prepared to be obedient in every respect.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.10" type="verse">When you forgive a man an offence I also forgive it; for in fact what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has always been for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.11" type="verse">for fear Satan should gain an advantage over us. For we are not ignorant of his  devices.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.12" type="verse">Now when I came into  the Troad to spread there the Good News about the Christ, even though in the Lord's providence a door stood open before me,</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.2.14" type="verse">But to God be the thanks who in Christ ever heads our  triumphal procession, and by our hands waves in every place that sweet incense, the knowledge of Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.15" type="verse">For we are a fragrance of Christ grateful to God in those  whom He is saving and in those who are perishing;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.16" type="verse">to the last-named an odor of death predictive of death, and to the others an odor of life predictive of life. And for such service as this who is competent?</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.2.17" type="verse">We are; for,  unlike most teachers, we are not fraudulent hucksters of God's Message; but with  transparent motives, as commissioned by God, in God's presence and in communion with Christ, so we speak.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.3.2" type="verse">Our letter of recommendation is yourselves--a letter written on our hearts and everywhere known and read.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.3" type="verse">For all can see that you are a letter of Christ entrusted to our care, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the  ever-living God--and not on tablets of stone, but on  human hearts as tablets.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.4" type="verse">Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in the presence of God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.5" type="verse">not that of ourselves we are competent to decide anything by our own reasonings, but our competency comes from God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.6" type="verse">It is He also who has made us competent to serve Him in connexion with a new  Covenant, which is not a written code but a Spirit; for the written code inflicts death, but the Spirit gives Life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.7" type="verse">If, however, the service  that proclaims death--its code being engraved in writing upon stones--came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily on the face of Moses because of the brightness of his face--a vanishing brightness;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.8" type="verse">will not the service of the Spirit be far more glorious?</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.9" type="verse">For if the service which pronounces doom  had glory, far more glorious still is the service which tells of righteousness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.10" type="verse">For, in fact, that which was once resplendent in glory has no glory at all in this respect, that it pales before the glory which surpasses it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.11" type="verse">For if that which was to be abolished came with glory, much more is that which is permanent arrayed in glory.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.12" type="verse">Therefore, cherishing a hope like this, we speak without reserve, and we do not imitate Moses,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.13" type="verse">who used to throw a veil over his face to hide from the gaze of the children of Israel the passing away of what was but transitory.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.14" type="verse">Nay, their minds were made dull; for to this very day during the reading of the book of the  ancient Covenant, the same veil  remains unlifted, because it is only in Christ that it is to be abolished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.15" type="verse">Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their  hearts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.16" type="verse">But whenever  the heart of the nation shall have returned to the Lord, the veil will be withdrawn.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.3.17" type="verse">Now by "the Lord" is meant the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is,  freedom is enjoyed.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.4.2" type="verse">Nay, we have renounced the secrecy which marks a feeling of shame. We practice no cunning tricks, nor do we adulterate God's Message. But by a full clear statement of the truth we strive to commend ourselves in the presence of God to every human conscience.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.3" type="verse">If, however, the meaning of our Good News has been veiled,  the veil has been on the hearts of those who are on the way to perdition,</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.4.10" type="verse">always, wherever we go, carrying with us in our bodies the putting to death of Jesus, so that in our bodies it may also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.11" type="verse">For we, alive though we are, are continually surrendering ourselves to death for the sake of Jesus, so that in this mortal nature of ours it may also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.12" type="verse">Thus we are constantly dying, while you are in full enjoyment of Life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.13" type="verse">But possessing the same Spirit of faith as he who wrote, &amp;lt;"I believed, and therefore I have spoken,"&amp;gt; we also believe, and therefore we speak.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.14" type="verse">For we know that He who  raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will raise us also to be with Jesus, and will cause  both us and you to stand in His own presence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.15" type="verse">For  everything is for your sakes, in order that grace, being more richly bestowed because of the thanksgivings of the increased number, may more and more promote the glory of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.16" type="verse">Therefore we are not cowards. Nay, even though our outward man is wasting away, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.17" type="verse">For this  our light and transitory burden of suffering is achieving for us a preponderating, yes, a vastly preponderating, and eternal weight of glory;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.4.18" type="verse">while  we look not at things seen, but things unseen; for things seen are temporary, but things unseen are eternal.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.5.1" type="verse">For we know that if this poor tent, our earthly house, is taken down, we have in Heaven a building which God has provided, a house not built by human hands, but eternal.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.2" type="verse">For in this one we sigh, because we long to put on over it our dwelling which comes from Heaven--</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.3" type="verse">if indeed having really put on a  robe we shall not be found to be unclothed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.4" type="verse">Yes, we who are in this tent certainly do sigh under our burdens, for  we do not wish to lay aside that with which we are now clothed, but to put on more, so that our mortality may be  absorbed in Life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.5" type="verse">And He who formed us with this very end in view is God, who has given us His Spirit as  a pledge and foretaste of that bliss.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.5.10" type="verse">For we must all of us appear before Christ's judgement-seat in our true characters, in order that each may then receive an award for his actions in this life, in accordance with what he has done, whether it be good or whether it be  worthless.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.11" type="verse">Therefore, because we realize how greatly the Lord is to be feared, we are endeavouring to win men over, and God recognizes what our motives are, and I hope that you, in your hearts, recognize them too.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.12" type="verse">We are not again commending ourselves to your favour, but are furnishing you with a ground of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have a reply ready for those with whom superficial appearances are everything and sincerity of heart counts for nothing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.13" type="verse">For if we have been beside ourselves, it has been for God's glory; or if we are now in our right senses, it is in order to be of service to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.14" type="verse">For the love of Christ overmasters us, the conclusion at which we have arrived being this--that One having died for all, His death was their death,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.15" type="verse">and that He died for all in order that the living may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.16" type="verse">Therefore for the future we know no one simply as a man. Even if we have known Christ as a man, yet now we do so no longer.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.17" type="verse">So that if any one is in Christ,  he is a new creature: the old state of things has passed away; a new state of things has come into existence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.18" type="verse">And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and has appointed us to serve in the ministry of reconciliation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.19" type="verse">We are to tell how God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not charging men's transgressions to their account, and that He has entrusted  to us the Message of this reconciliation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.5.20" type="verse">On Christ's behalf therefore we come as ambassadors, God, as it were, making entreaty through our lips: we, on Christ's behalf, beseech men to be reconciled to God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.8.7" type="verse">Yes, just as you are already  very rich in faith, readiness of speech, knowledge, unwearied zeal, and in the love  that is in you, implanted by us, see to it that this grace of liberal giving also flourishes in you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.8" type="verse">I am not saying this by way of command, but to test by the standard of other men's earnestness the genuineness of your love also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.9" type="verse">For you know the condescending goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ--how for your sakes He became poor, though He was rich, in order that you through His poverty might grow rich.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.10" type="verse">But in this matter I give you an opinion; for my doing this helps forward your own intentions, seeing that not only have you begun operations, but a year ago you already had the desire to do so.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.11" type="verse">And now complete the doing also, in order that, just as there was then the eagerness in desiring, there may now be the accomplishment in proportion to your means.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.12" type="verse">For, assuming the earnest willingness, the gift is acceptable according to whatever a man has, and not according to what he has not.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.13" type="verse">I do not urge you to give in order that others may have relief while you are unduly pressed,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.14" type="verse">but that, by equalization of burdens, your superfluity having in the present emergency supplied their deficiency, their superfluity may in turn be a supply for your deficiency later on, so that there may be equalization of burdens.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.15" type="verse">Even as it is written, &amp;lt;"He who gathered much had not  too much, and he who gathered little had not  too little."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.16" type="verse">But thanks be to God that He inspires the heart of Titus with the same deep interest in you;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.17" type="verse">for Titus welcomed our request, and, being thoroughly in earnest, comes to you of his own free will.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.18" type="verse">And we send with him the brother whose  praises for his earnestness in proclaiming the Good News are heard throughout all the Churches.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.19" type="verse">And more than that, he is the one who was chosen by the  vote of the Churches to travel with us, sharing our commission in the administration of this generous gift to promote the Lord's glory and gratify our own strong desire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.20" type="verse">For against one thing we are on our guard--I mean against blame being thrown upon us in respect to these large and liberal contributions which are under our charge.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.21" type="verse">For we seek not only God's approval of our integrity, but man's also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.22" type="verse">And we send with them our brother, of whose zeal we have had frequent proof in many matters, and who is now more zealous than ever through the strong confidence which he has in you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.23" type="verse">As for Titus, remember that he is a partner with me, and is my comrade in my labours for you. And as for our brethren, remember that they are  delegates from the Churches, and are men in whom Christ is glorified.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.8.24" type="verse">Exhibit therefore to the Churches a proof of your love, and a justification of our boasting to these brethren about you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.9.1" type="verse">As to the services which are being rendered to God's people, it is really unnecessary for me to write to you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.9.3" type="verse">Still I send the brethren in order that in this matter our boast about you may not turn out to have been an idle one; so that, as I have said, you may be ready;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.4" type="verse">for fear that, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say you yourselves--should be put to the blush in respect to this confidence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.5" type="verse">I have thought it absolutely necessary therefore to request these brethren to visit you before I myself come, and to make sure beforehand that the  gift of love which you have already promised may be ready as a gift of love, and may not seem to have been something which I have extorted from you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.6" type="verse">But do not forget that he who sows with a niggardly hand will also reap a niggardly crop, and that he who sows  bountifully will also reap bountifully.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.7" type="verse">Let each contribute  what he has decided upon in his own mind, and not do it reluctantly or under compulsion. &amp;lt;"It is a cheerful giver that God loves."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.8" type="verse">And God is able to bestow every blessing on you in abundance, so that  richly enjoying all sufficiency at all times, you may have ample means for all good works.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.9.10" type="verse">And God who  continually supplies seed for the sower and bread for eating,  will supply you with seed and multiply it, and will cause your almsgiving to yield a plentiful harvest.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.11" type="verse">May you be  abundantly enriched so as to show all liberality, such as through our instrumentality brings thanksgiving to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.12" type="verse">For the service rendered in this sacred gift not only helps to relieve the wants of God's people, but it is also rich in its results and awakens a chorus of thanksgiving to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.13" type="verse">For,  by the practical proof of it which you exhibit in this service, you cause God to be extolled for your  fidelity to your professed adherence to the Good News of the Christ, and for the liberality of your contributions for them and for  all who are in need,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.9.14" type="verse">while they themselves also in supplications on your behalf pour out their longing love towards you because of God's surpassing grace which is resting upon you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.10.1" type="verse">But as for me Paul, I entreat you by the gentleness and self-forgetfulness of Christ--I who when among you have not an imposing personal presence, but when absent am fearlessly outspoken in dealing with you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.2" type="verse">I beseech you not to compel me when present to make a bold display of the confidence with which I reckon I shall show my `courage' against some who reckon that we are guided by worldly principles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.3" type="verse">For, though we are still living in the world, it is no worldly warfare that we are waging.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.4" type="verse">The weapons with which we fight are not human weapons, but are mighty for God in overthrowing strong fortresses.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.5" type="verse">For we overthrow arrogant `reckonings,' and every stronghold that towers high in defiance of the knowledge of God, and we carry off every thought as if into slavery--into subjection to Christ;</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.10.8" type="verse">If, however, I were to boast more loudly of our  Apostolic authority, which the Lord has given us that we may build you up, not  pull you down, I should have no reason to feel ashamed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.9" type="verse">Let it not seem as if I wanted to frighten you by my letters.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.10" type="verse">For they say "His letters are authoritative and forcible, but his personal presence is unimpressive, and as for eloquence, he has none."</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.11" type="verse">Let such people take this into their reckoning, that whatever we are in word by our letters when absent, the same are we also in act when present.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.12" type="verse">For we have not the `courage' to rank ourselves among, or compare ourselves with, certain persons distinguished by their self-commendation. Yet they are not wise, measuring themselves, as they do, by one another and comparing themselves with one another.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.13" type="verse">We, however, will not exceed due limits in our boasting, but will keep within the limits of the sphere which God has assigned to us as a limit, which reaches even to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.14" type="verse">For there is no undue stretch of authority on our part, as though it did not extend to you. We pressed on even to Corinth, and were the first to proclaim to you the Good News of the Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.15" type="verse">We do not exceed our due limits, and take credit for other men's labours; but we entertain the hope that, as your faith grows, we shall gain promotion among you--still keeping within our own sphere--promotion to a larger field of labour,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.16" type="verse">and shall tell the Good News in the districts beyond you, not boasting in another man's sphere about work already done by him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.17" type="verse">But &amp;lt;"whoever boasts, let his boast be in the Lord."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.10.18" type="verse">For it is not the man that commends himself who is really approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.11.7" type="verse">Is it a sin that I abased myself in order for you to be exalted, in that I proclaimed God's Good News to you without fee or reward?</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.11.9" type="verse">And when I was with you and my resources failed, there was no one to whom I became a burden--for the brethren when they came from Macedonia fully supplied my wants--and I kept myself from being in the least a burden to you, and will do so still.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.11.13" type="verse">For men of this stamp are sham apostles, dishonest workmen, assuming the garb of Apostles of Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.14" type="verse">And no wonder.  Satan, their master, can disguise himself as an angel of light.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.15" type="verse">It is therefore no great thing for his servants also to disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be in accordance with their actions.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.16" type="verse">To return to what I was saying. Let no one suppose that I am  foolish. Or if you must, at any rate make allowance for me as being foolish, in order that I, as well as they, may boast a little.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.17" type="verse">What I am now saying, I do not say by the Lord's command, but as a fool in his folly might, in this reckless boasting.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.11.20" type="verse">For you tolerate it, if any one enslaves you, lives at your expense, makes off with your property, gives himself airs, or  strikes you on the face.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.21" type="verse">I use the language of self-disparagement, as though I were admitting our own feebleness. Yet for whatever reason any one is `courageous' --I speak in mere folly--I also am courageous.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2CO.11.22" type="verse">Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2CO.12.6" type="verse">If however I  should choose to boast, I should not be a fool for so doing, for I should be speaking the truth.

          <seg id="b.2CO.12.11" type="verse">It is foolish of me to write all this, but you have compelled me to do so. Why, you ought to have been my vindicators; for in no respect have I been inferior to these superlatively great Apostles, even though in myself I am nothing.</seg>

          <seg id="b.GAL.1.1" type="verse">Paul, an Apostle sent not from men nor by any man, but by Jesus Christ and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from among the dead--</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.2" type="verse">and all the brethren who are with me: To the Churches of Galatia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.3" type="verse">May grace and peace be granted to you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.4" type="verse">who gave Himself to suffer for our sins in order to rescue us from the present wicked age in accordance with the will of our God and Father.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.5" type="verse">To Him be the glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.6" type="verse">I marvel that you are so readily leaving Him who called you by the grace of Christ, and are adhering to a different Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.7" type="verse">For other "Good News" there is none; but there are some persons who are troubling you, and are seeking to distort the Good News concerning Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.8" type="verse">But if even we or an angel from Heaven should bring you a Good News different from that which we have already brought you, let him be accursed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.9" type="verse">What I have just said I repeat--if any one is preaching to you a Good News other than that which you originally received, let him be accursed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.10" type="verse">For is it man's favour or God's that I aspire to? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still a man-pleaser, I should not be Christ's bondservant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.11" type="verse">For I must tell you, brethren, that the Good News which was proclaimed by me is not such as man approves of.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.12" type="verse">For, in fact, it was not from man that I received or learnt it, but by a revelation from Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.13" type="verse">For you have heard of my early career in Judaism--how I furiously persecuted the Church of God, and made havoc of it;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.14" type="verse">and how in devotion to Judaism I outstripped many men of my own age among my people, being far more zealous than they on behalf of the traditions of my forefathers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.15" type="verse">But when He who set me apart even from my birth, and called me by His grace,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.16" type="verse">saw fit to reveal His Son within me in order that I might tell among the Gentiles the Good News concerning Him, at once I did not confer with any human being,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.17" type="verse">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were my seniors in the Apostleship, but I went away into Arabia, and afterwards came back to Damascus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.18" type="verse">Then, three years later, I went up to Jerusalem to inquire for  Peter, and I spent a fortnight with him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.19" type="verse">I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the Lord's brother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.20" type="verse">In making these assertions I am speaking the truth, as in the sight of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.21" type="verse">Afterwards I visited Syria and Cilicia.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.22" type="verse">But to the Christian Churches in Judaea I was personally unknown.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.23" type="verse">They only heard it said, "He who was once our persecutor is now telling the Good News of the faith of which he formerly made havoc."</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.1.24" type="verse">And they gave glory to God on my account.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.GAL.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.1" type="verse">Later still, after an interval of fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem in company with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.2" type="verse">I went up in obedience to a revelation of God's will; and I explained to them the Good News which I proclaim among the Gentiles. To the leaders of the Church this explanation was made in private, lest by any means I should be running, or should already have run, in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.3" type="verse">But although my companion Titus was a Greek they did not insist upon even his being circumcised.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.4" type="verse">Yet there was danger of this through the false brethren secretly introduced into the Church, who had stolen in to spy out the  freedom which is ours in Christ Jesus, in order to rob us of it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.5" type="verse">But not for an hour did we give way and submit to them; in order that the Good News might continue with you in its integrity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.6" type="verse">From those leaders I gained nothing new. Whether they were men of importance or not, matters nothing to me--God recognizes no external distinctions. To me, at any rate, the leaders imparted nothing new.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.7" type="verse">Indeed, when they saw that I was entrusted with the preaching of the Good News to the Gentiles as Peter had been with that to the Jews--</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.8" type="verse">for He who had been at work within Peter with a view to his Apostleship to the Jews had also been at work within me with a view to my Apostleship to the Gentiles--</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.9" type="verse">and when they perceived the  mission which was graciously entrusted to me, they (that is to say, James,  Peter, and John, who were considered to be the pillars of the Church) welcomed Barnabas and me to their fellowship on the understanding that we were to go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.10" type="verse">Only they urged that we should remember their poor--a thing which was uppermost in my own mind.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.11" type="verse">Now when  Peter visited Antioch, I remonstrated with him to his face, because he had incurred just censure.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.12" type="verse">For until certain persons came from James he had been accustomed to eat with Gentiles; but as soon as these persons came, he withdrew and separated himself for fear of the Circumcision party.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.13" type="verse">And along with him the other Jews also concealed their real opinions, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their lack of straightforwardness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.14" type="verse">As soon as I saw that they were not walking uprightly in the spirit of the Good News, I said to  Peter, before them all, "If you, though you are a Jew, live as a Gentile does, and not as a Jew, how can you make the Gentiles follow Jewish customs?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.15" type="verse">You and I, though we are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.16" type="verse">know that it is not through obedience to Law that a man can be declared free from guilt, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. We have therefore believed in Christ Jesus, for the purpose of being declared free from guilt, through faith in Christ and not through obedience to Law. For through obedience to Law no human being shall be declared free from guilt.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.17" type="verse">But if while we are seeking in Christ acquittal from guilt we ourselves are convicted of sin, Christ then encourages us to sin! No, indeed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.18" type="verse">Why, if I am now rebuilding that structure of sin which I had demolished, I am thereby constituting myself a transgressor;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.19" type="verse">for it is by the Law that I have died to the Law, in order that I may live to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.20" type="verse">I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ that lives in me; and the life which I now live in the body I live through faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up to death on my behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.2.21" type="verse">I do not nullify the grace of God; for if acquittal from guilt is obtainable through the Law, then Christ has died in vain."</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.GAL.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.1" type="verse">You foolish Galatians! Whose sophistry has bewitched you--you to whom Jesus Christ has been vividly portrayed  as on the Cross?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.2" type="verse">Answer me this one question, "Is it on the ground of your obedience to the Law that you received the Spirit, or is it because, when you heard, you believed?"</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.3" type="verse">Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now going to reach perfection through what is external?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.4" type="verse">Have you  endured such sufferings to no purpose--if indeed it has been to no purpose?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.5" type="verse">He who gives you His Spirit and works miracles among you--does He do so on the ground of your obedience to the Law, or is it the result of your having heard and believed:</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.6" type="verse">even as &amp;lt;Abraham believed God, and his faith was placed to his account as righteousness?&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.7" type="verse">Notice therefore that those who possess faith are true sons of Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.8" type="verse">And the Scripture, foreseeing that in consequence of faith God would declare the nations to be free from guilt, sent beforehand the Good News to Abraham, saying, &amp;lt;"In you all the nations shall be blessed."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.9" type="verse">So we see that it is those who possess faith that are blessed with believing Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.10" type="verse">All who are depending upon their own obedience to the Law are under a curse, for it is written, &amp;lt;"Cursed is every one who does not remain faithful to all the precepts of the Law, and practise them."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.11" type="verse">It is evident, too, that no one can find acceptance with God simply by obeying the Law, because &amp;lt;"the righteous shall live by faith,"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.12" type="verse">and the Law has nothing to do with faith. It teaches that &amp;lt;"he who does these things shall live by doing them."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.13" type="verse">Christ has purchased our freedom from the curse of the Law by becoming accursed for us--because &amp;lt;"Cursed is every one who is hanged upon a tree."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.14" type="verse">Our freedom has been thus purchased in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing belonging to Abraham may come upon the nations, so that through faith we may receive the promised Spirit.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.15" type="verse">Brethren, even a covenant made by a man--to borrow an illustration from daily life--when once formally sanctioned is not liable to be set aside or added to.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.16" type="verse">(Now the promises were given to Abraham and to his seed. God did not say "and to seeds," as if speaking of many, but "and to your seed," since He spoke of only one--and this is Christ.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.17" type="verse">I mean that the Covenant which God had already formally made is not abrogated by the Law which was given four hundred and thirty years later--so as to annul the promise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.18" type="verse">For if the inheritance comes through obedience to Law, it no longer comes because of a promise. But, as a matter of fact, God has granted it to Abraham in fulfilment of a promise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.19" type="verse">Why then was the Law given? It was imposed later on for the sake of  defining sin, until the seed should come to whom God had made the promise; and its details were laid down by a mediator with the help of angels.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.20" type="verse">But there cannot be a mediator where only one individual is concerned.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.21" type="verse">God, however, is only one. Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? No, indeed; for if a Law had been given which could have conferred Life, righteousness would certainly have come by the Law.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.22" type="verse">But Scripture has shown that all mankind are the prisoners of sin, in order that the promised blessing, which depends on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who believe.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.23" type="verse">Before this faith came, we Jews were perpetual prisoners under the Law, living under restraints and limitations in preparation for the faith which was soon to be revealed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.24" type="verse">So that the Law has acted the part of a tutor-slave  to lead us to Christ, in order that through faith we may be declared to be free from guilt.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.25" type="verse">But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor-slave.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.26" type="verse">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.27" type="verse">for all of you who have been baptized  into Christ, have clothed yourselves with Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.28" type="verse">In Him the distinctions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free man, male and female, disappear; you are all one in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.3.29" type="verse">And if you belong to Christ, then you are indeed true descendants of Abraham, and are heirs in fulfilment of the promise.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.GAL.4" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.1" type="verse">Now I say that so long as  an heir is a child, he in no respect differs from a slave, although he is the owner of everything,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.2" type="verse">but he is under the control of guardians and trustees until the time his father has appointed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.3" type="verse">So we also, when spiritually we were children, were subject to the world's rudimentary notions, and were enslaved.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.4" type="verse">But, when the time was fully come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born subject to Law,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.5" type="verse">in order to purchase the freedom of all who were subject to Law, so that we might receive recognition as sons.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.6" type="verse">And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of His Son to enter your hearts and cry "Abba! our Father!"</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.7" type="verse">Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir also through God's own act.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.8" type="verse">But at one time, you Gentiles, having no knowledge of God, were slaves to gods which in reality do not exist.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.9" type="verse">Now, however, having come to know God--or rather to be known by Him--how is it you are again turning back to weak and worthless rudimentary notions to which you are once more willing to be enslaved?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.10" type="verse">You scrupulously observe days and months, special seasons, and years.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.11" type="verse">I am alarmed about you, and am afraid that I have perhaps bestowed labour upon you to no purpose.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.12" type="verse">Brethren, become as I am, I beseech you; for I have also become like you. In no respect did you behave badly to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.13" type="verse">And you know that in those early days it was on account of  bodily infirmity that I proclaimed the Good News to you,</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.14" type="verse">and yet the bodily infirmity which was such a trial to you, you did not regard with contempt or loathing, but you received me as if I had been an angel of God or Christ Jesus Himself!</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.15" type="verse">I ask you, then, what has become of your  self-congratulations? For I bear you witness that had it been possible you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.16" type="verse">Can it be that I have become your enemy through speaking the truth to you?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.17" type="verse">These men pay court to you, but not with honourable motives. They want to exclude you, so that you may pay court to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.18" type="verse">It is always an honourable thing to be courted in an honourable cause; always, and not only when I am with you, my children--</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.19" type="verse">you for whom I am again, as it were, undergoing the pains of childbirth, until Christ is fully formed within you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.20" type="verse">Would that I were with you and could  change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.21" type="verse">Tell me--you who want to continue to be subject to Law--will you not listen to the Law?</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.22" type="verse">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave-girl and one by the free woman.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.23" type="verse">But we see that the child of the slave-girl was born in the common course of nature; but the child of the free woman in fulfilment of the promise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.24" type="verse">All this is allegorical; for the women represent two Covenants. One has its origin on Mount Sinai, and bears children destined for slavery.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.25" type="verse">This is Hagar;  for the name Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage together with her children.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.26" type="verse">But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and *she* is *our* mother.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.27" type="verse">For it is written, &amp;lt;"Rejoice, thou  barren woman that bearest not, break forth into a joyful cry, thou that dost not travail with child. For the desolate woman has many children--more indeed than she who has the husband."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.28" type="verse">But you, brethren, like Isaac, are children born in fulfilment of a promise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.29" type="verse">Yet just as, at that time, the child born in the common course of nature persecuted the one whose birth was due to the power of the Spirit, so it is now.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.30" type="verse">But what says the Scripture? &amp;lt;"Send away the slave-girl and her son, for never shall the slave-girl's son share the inheritance with the son of the free woman."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.4.31" type="verse">Therefore, brethren, since we are not the children of a slave-girl, but of the free woman--</seg>

          <seg id="b.GAL.5.3" type="verse">I once more protest to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to obey the whole Law of Moses.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.5.4" type="verse">Christ has become nothing to any of you who are seeking acceptance with God through the Law: you have fallen away from grace.</seg>

          <seg id="b.GAL.5.16" type="verse">This then is what I mean. Let your lives be guided by the Spirit, and then you will certainly not  indulge the cravings of  your lower natures.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.5.17" type="verse">For the cravings of the lower nature are opposed to those of the Spirit, and the cravings of the Spirit are opposed to those of the lower nature; because these are antagonistic to each other, so that you cannot do everything to which you are inclined.</seg>
          <seg id="b.GAL.5.18" type="verse">But if  the Spirit is leading you, you are not subject to Law.</seg>

          <seg id="b.EPH.2.11" type="verse">Therefore, do not forget that formerly you were Gentiles as to your bodily condition. You were called the Uncircumcision by those who style themselves the Circumcised--their circumcision being one which the knife has effected.</seg>

          <seg id="b.EPH.2.13" type="verse">But now in Christ Jesus you who once were so far away have been brought near through the death of Christ.</seg>

          <seg id="b.EPH.5.24" type="verse">And just as the Church submits to Christ, so also married women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.25" type="verse">Married men, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up to death for her;</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.26" type="verse">in order to make her holy, cleansing her with  the baptismal water by the word,</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.27" type="verse">that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be holy and unblemished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.28" type="verse">So too married men ought to love their wives as much as they love themselves. He who loves his wife loves himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.29" type="verse">For never yet has a man hated his own body. On the contrary he feeds and cherishes it, just as Christ feeds and cherishes the Church;</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.30" type="verse">because we are, as it were, parts of His Body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.31" type="verse">&amp;lt;"For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.32" type="verse">That is a great truth hitherto kept secret: I mean the truth concerning Christ and the Church.</seg>
          <seg id="b.EPH.5.33" type="verse">Yet I insist that among you also, each man is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman see to it that she treats her husband with respect.</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.1.3" type="verse">I thank my God at  my every remembrance of you--</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.4" type="verse">always when offering any prayer on behalf of you all, finding a joy in offering it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.5" type="verse">I thank my God, I say, for your cooperation in spreading the Good News, from the time it first came to you even until now.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.6" type="verse">For of this I am confident, that He who has begun a good work within you will go on to perfect it in preparation for the day of Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.7" type="verse">And I am justified in having this confidence about you all, because, both during my imprisonment and when I stand up in  defence of the Good News or to confirm its truth, I have you in my heart, sharers as you all are in the same grace as myself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.8" type="verse">For God is my witness how I yearn over all of you with tender Christian affection.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.9" type="verse">And it is my prayer that your love may be more and more accompanied by clear knowledge and keen perception, for  testing things that differ,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.10" type="verse">so that you may be men of transparent character, and may be blameless, in preparation for the day of Christ,</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.1.12" type="verse">Now I would have you know, brethren, that what I have gone through has turned out to the furtherance of the Good News rather than otherwise.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.13" type="verse">And thus it has become notorious among all the Imperial Guards, and everywhere, that it is  for the sake of Christ that I am a prisoner;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.14" type="verse">and the greater part of the brethren, made confident in the Lord  through my imprisonment, now speak of God's Message without fear, more boldly than ever.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.15" type="verse">Some indeed actually preach Christ out of envy and contentiousness but there are also others who do it from good will.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.16" type="verse">These latter preach Him from love to me, knowing that I am here for the defence of the Good News;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.17" type="verse">while  the others proclaim Him from motives of rivalry, and insincerely, supposing that by this they are embittering my imprisonment.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.18" type="verse">What does it matter, however? In any case Christ is preached--either perversely or in honest truth; and in that I rejoice, yes,  and will rejoice.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.19" type="verse">For I know that it will result in my  salvation through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.20" type="verse">in fulfilment of my  eager expectation and hope that I shall never have reason to feel ashamed, but that by my perfect freedom of speech Christ will be glorified in me, now as always, either by my life or by my death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.21" type="verse">For, with me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.22" type="verse">But since to live means a longer stay on earth, that implies more labour for me--and not unsuccessful labour; and which I am to choose I cannot tell.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.23" type="verse">I am in a dilemma, my earnest desire being to depart and be with Christ, for that is far, far better.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.24" type="verse">But for your sakes it is more important that I should still remain in the body.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.25" type="verse">I am convinced of this, and I know that I shall remain, and shall go on working side by side with you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.26" type="verse">so that, as Christians, you may have additional reason for glorying about me as the result of my being with you again.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.27" type="verse">Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder  for the faith of the Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.28" type="verse">Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation--a token coming from God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.29" type="verse">For you have had the privilege granted you on behalf of Christ--not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.1.30" type="verse">maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that  you once saw in me and which you still hear  that I am engaged in.</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.2.2" type="verse">united by mutual love, with harmony of feeling giving your minds to one and the same object.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.3" type="verse">Do nothing in a spirit of factiousness or of vainglory, but, with true humility, let every one regard the rest as being of more account than himself;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.4" type="verse">each fixing his attention, not simply on his own  interests, but on those of others also.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.5" type="verse">Let the same disposition be in you which was in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.6" type="verse">Although from the beginning He  had the nature of God He did not reckon His equality with God a treasure to be tightly grasped.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.7" type="verse">Nay,  He stripped Himself of His glory, and took on Him the nature of  a bondservant by becoming a man like other men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.8" type="verse">And  being recognized as truly human, He humbled Himself and even stooped to die; yes, to die on a cross.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.9" type="verse">It is in consequence of this that God has also so highly exalted Him, and has conferred on Him the Name which is supreme above every other,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.10" type="verse">in order that in the Name of JESUS every knee should bow, of beings in Heaven, of those on the earth, and of those in the underworld,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.11" type="verse">and that every tongue should confess that JESUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of God the Father.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.12" type="verse">Therefore, my dearly-loved friends, as I have always found you obedient, labour earnestly with fear and trembling--not merely as though I were present with you, but much more now since I am absent from you--labour earnestly, I say, to make sure of your own salvation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.13" type="verse">For it is God Himself whose power creates within you the desire to do His gracious will and also brings about the accomplishment of the desire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.14" type="verse">Be ever on your guard against a grudging and contentious spirit,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.15" type="verse">so that you may always prove yourselves to be blameless and spotless--irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as heavenly lights  in the world,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.16" type="verse">holding out to them a Message of Life. It will then be my glory on the day of Christ that I did not run my race in vain nor toil in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.17" type="verse">Nay, even if my life is to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I rejoice, and I congratulate you all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.18" type="verse">And I bid you also share my gladness, and congratulate me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.19" type="verse">But, if the Lord permits it, I hope before long to send Timothy to you, that I, in turn, may be cheered by getting news of you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.20" type="verse">For I have no one likeminded with him, who will cherish a genuine care for you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.21" type="verse">Everybody concerns himself about his own interests, not about those of Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.22" type="verse">But you know Timothy's approved worth--how, like a child working with his father, he has served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.23" type="verse">So it is he that I hope to send as soon as ever I see how things go with me;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.24" type="verse">but trusting, as I do, in the Lord, I believe that I shall myself also come to you before long.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.25" type="verse">Yet I  deem it important to send Epaphroditus to you now--he is my brother and comrade both in labour and in arms, and is your messenger who has ministered to my needs.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.26" type="verse">I send him because he is longing  to see you all and is distressed at your having heard of his illness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.27" type="verse">For it is true that he has been ill, and was apparently at the point of death; but God had pity on him, and not only on him, but also on me, to save me from having sorrow upon sorrow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.28" type="verse">I am therefore all the more eager to send him, in the hope that when you see him  again you may be glad and I may have the less sorrow.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.29" type="verse">Receive him therefore with heartfelt Christian joy, and hold in honour men like him;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.2.30" type="verse">because it was for the sake of Christ's work that he came so near death, hazarding, as he did, his very life in endeavouring to make good any deficiency that there might be in your gifts to me.</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.3.1" type="verse">In conclusion, my brethren, be joyful in the Lord. For me to give you the same warnings as before is not irksome to me, while so far as you are concerned it is a safe precaution.</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.3.3" type="verse">For we are the true circumcision--we who  render to God a spiritual worship and make our boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in  outward ceremonies:</seg>

          <seg id="b.PHI.3.8" type="verse">Nay, I even reckon all things as  pure loss because of the priceless privilege of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. And for His sake I have suffered the loss of everything, and reckon it all as mere refuse, in order that I may win Christ and be found in union with Him,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.9" type="verse">not having a righteousness of my own, derived from the Law, but that which arises from faith in Christ--the righteousness which comes from God through faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.10" type="verse">I long to know Christ and the power which is in His resurrection, and to share in His sufferings and die even as He died;</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.11" type="verse">in the hope that I may attain to  the resurrection from among the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.12" type="verse">I do not say that I have already won the race or have already  reached perfection. But I am pressing on, striving to lay hold of the prize for which also Christ has laid hold of me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.13" type="verse">Brethren, I do not imagine that I have yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do--forgetting everything which is past and stretching forward to what lies in front of me,</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.14" type="verse">with my eyes fixed on the goal I push on to secure the prize of God's  heavenward call in Christ Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.PHI.3.15" type="verse">Therefore let all of us who are mature believers cherish these thoughts; and if in any respect you think differently, that also God will make clear to you.</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.1.3" type="verse">We give thanks  to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, constantly praying for you as we do,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.4" type="verse">because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you cherish towards all God's people,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.5" type="verse">on account of the hope treasured up for you in Heaven. Of this hope you have already heard in the Message of the truth of the Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.6" type="verse">For it has reached you, and remains with you, just as  it has also spread through the whole world, yielding fruit there and increasing, as it has done among you from the day when  first you heard it and came really to know the grace of God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.7" type="verse">as you learned it from Epaphras our dearly-loved fellow servant. He is to you a faithful minister of Christ in our stead,</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.1.9" type="verse">For this reason we also, from the day we  first received these tidings,  have never ceased to pray for you and to entreat that you may be filled with a clear knowledge of His will accompanied by thorough wisdom and discernment in spiritual things;</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.10" type="verse">so that your lives may be worthy of the Lord and perfectly pleasing to Him, while you exhibit the results of right action of every sort and grow into a fuller knowledge of God.</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.1.12" type="verse">and give thanks to the Father who has made us fit to receive our share of the inheritance of God's people in Light.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.13" type="verse">It is God who has delivered us out of the dominion of darkness, and has transferred us into the Kingdom of His dearly-loved Son,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.14" type="verse">in whom we have our redemption--the forgiveness of our sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.15" type="verse">Christ is the  visible representation of the invisible God,  the Firstborn and Lord of all creation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.16" type="verse">For  in Him was created the universe of things in heaven and on earth, things seen and things unseen,  thrones, dominions, princedoms, powers--all were created,  and exist through and for Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.17" type="verse">And  HE IS before all things and in and through Him the universe is a harmonious whole.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.18" type="verse">Moreover He is the Head of His Body, the Church. He is the Beginning, the Firstborn from among the dead, in order that He Himself may in all things occupy the foremost place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.19" type="verse">For it was the Father's gracious will that the whole of the divine perfections should dwell in Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.20" type="verse">And God purposed through Him to reconcile the universe to Himself, making peace through His blood, which was shed upon the Cross--to reconcile to Himself through Him, I say, things on earth and things in Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.21" type="verse">And you, estranged as you once were and even hostile in your minds, amidst your evil deeds,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.22" type="verse">He has now, in His human body, reconciled to God by His death, to bring you, holy and faultless and irreproachable, into His presence;</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.1.23" type="verse">if, indeed, you are still firmly holding to faith as your foundation, without ever shifting from your hope that rests on the Good News that you have heard, which has been proclaimed in the whole creation under Heaven, and in which I Paul have been appointed to serve.</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.2.3" type="verse">In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are stored up, hidden from view.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.4" type="verse">I say this to prevent your being misled by any one's plausible sophistry.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.5" type="verse">For although, as you say, I am absent from you in body, yet in spirit I am present with you and am delighted to witness your good  discipline and the  solid front presented by your faith in Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.6" type="verse">As therefore you have received the Christ, even Jesus our Lord,  live and act in vital union with Him;</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.2.8" type="verse">Take care lest there be some one who leads you away as prisoners by means of his philosophy and idle fancies, following human traditions and the world's crude notions instead of following Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.9" type="verse">For it is in Christ that the fulness of God's nature dwells embodied, and in Him you are made complete,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.10" type="verse">and He is the  Lord of all  princes and rulers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.11" type="verse">In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not performed by hand, when you threw off your sinful nature in true Christian circumcision;</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.12" type="verse">having been buried with Him in your baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith produced within you by God who raised Him from among the dead.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.13" type="verse">And to you--dead as you once were in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your natural state--He has nevertheless given Life with Himself, having forgiven us all our transgressions.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.14" type="verse">The bond,  with its requirements, which was in force against us and was hostile to us, He cancelled, and cleared it out of the way, nailing it to His Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.15" type="verse">And the hostile princes and rulers He shook off from Himself, and boldly displayed them as His conquests, when by the Cross He triumphed over them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.16" type="verse">Therefore suffer no one to sit in judgement on you as to eating or drinking or with regard to a festival, a new moon or a sabbath.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.17" type="verse">These were a shadow of things that were soon to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.18" type="verse">Let no one defraud you of your prize,  priding himself on his humility and on his worship of the angels, and taking his stand on the visions he has seen, and idly puffed up with his unspiritual thoughts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.19" type="verse">Such a one does not keep his hold upon Christ, the Head, from whom the Body, in all its parts nourished and strengthened by its points of contact and its connections, grows with a divine growth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.20" type="verse">If you have died with Christ and have escaped from the world's rudimentary notions, why, as though your life still belonged to the world, do you submit to such precepts as</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.21" type="verse">"Do not handle this;" "Do not taste that;" "Do not touch that other thing" --</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.22" type="verse">referring to things which are all intended to be used up and perish--in obedience to mere human injunctions and teachings?</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.2.23" type="verse">These rules have indeed an appearance of wisdom where self-imposed worship exists, and an affectation of humility and an ascetic severity. But not one of them is of any value in combating the indulgence of our lower natures.</seg>

        <div id="b.COL.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.COL.3.1" type="verse">If however you  have risen with Christ,  seek the things that are above, where Christ is, enthroned at God's right hand.</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.3.3" type="verse">For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.4" type="verse">When Christ appears--He is  our true Life--then you also will appear with Him in glory.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.5" type="verse">Therefore put to death your earthward inclinations--fornication, impurity, sensual passion, unholy desire, and all greed, for that is a form of idolatry.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.6" type="verse">It is on account of these very sins that God's anger is coming,</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.7" type="verse">and you also were once addicted to them, while you were living under their power.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.8" type="verse">But now you must rid yourselves of every kind of sin--angry and passionate outbreaks, ill-will, evil speaking, foul-mouthed abuse--so that these may never soil your lips.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.9" type="verse">Do not speak falsehoods to one another, for you have stripped off the old self with its doings,</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.3.11" type="verse">In that new creation  there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free man, but Christ is everything and is  in all of us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.12" type="verse">Clothe yourselves therefore, as God's own people holy and dearly loved, with tender-heartedness, kindness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.13" type="verse">bearing with one another and readily forgiving each other, if any one has a grievance against another. Just as  the Lord has forgiven you, you also must forgive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.14" type="verse">And over all these put on love, which is the perfect bond of union;</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.15" type="verse">and let the peace which Christ gives settle all questionings in your hearts, to which peace indeed you were called as belonging to His one Body; and be thankful.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.16" type="verse">Let the teaching  concerning Christ remain as a rich treasure in your hearts.  In all wisdom teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and sing with grace in your hearts to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.17" type="verse">And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything  in the name of the Lord Jesus, and let it be through Him that you give thanks to God the Father.</seg>

          <seg id="b.COL.3.19" type="verse">Married men, be affectionate to your wives, and do not treat them harshly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.20" type="verse">Children be obedient to your parents in everything; for that is right for Christians.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.21" type="verse">Fathers, do not fret and harass your children, or you may make them sullen and morose.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.22" type="verse">Slaves, be obedient in everything to your earthly masters; not  in acts of eye service, as aiming only to please men, but with simplicity of purpose, because you fear the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.23" type="verse">Whatever you are doing, let your hearts be in your work, as a thing done for the Lord and not for men.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.24" type="verse">For you know that it is from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. Christ is the Master whose bondservants you are.</seg>
          <seg id="b.COL.3.25" type="verse">The man who perpetrates a wrong will find the wrong repaid to him; and with God there are  no merely earthly distinctions.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.1.6" type="verse">And you followed the pattern set you by us and by the Master, after you had received the Message amid severe persecution, and yet with the joy which the Holy Spirit gives,</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.2.3" type="verse">For our  preaching was not grounded on a delusion, nor prompted by mingled motives, nor was there fraud in it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.2.4" type="verse">But as God tested and approved us before entrusting us with His Good News, so in what we say we are seeking not to please men but to please God, who tests and approves our motives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.2.5" type="verse">For, as you are well aware, we have never used the language of flattery nor have we found pretexts for enriching ourselves--God is our witness;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.2.9" type="verse">For  you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: how, working night and day so as not to become a burden to any one of you, we came and proclaimed among you God's Good News.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.2.10" type="verse">You yourselves are witnesses--and God is witness--how holy and upright and blameless our dealings with you believers were.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.3.2" type="verse">and sent Timothy our brother and  God's minister in the service of Christ's Good News, that he might help you spiritually and encourage you in your faith;</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.3.4" type="verse">For even when we were with you, we forewarned you, saying, "We are soon to suffer affliction;" and this actually happened, as you well know.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.3.5" type="verse">For this reason I also, when I could no longer endure the uncertainty, sent to know the condition of your faith, lest perchance the Tempter might have tempted you and our labour have been lost.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.3.6" type="verse">But now that Timothy has recently come back to us from you, and has brought us the happy tidings of your faith and love, and has told us how you still cherish a constant and affectionate recollection of us, and are longing to see us as we also long to see you--</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.3.7" type="verse">for this reason in our distress and trouble we have been comforted about you, brethren, by your faith.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.3.9" type="verse">For what thanksgiving on your behalf can we possibly offer to God in return for all the joy which fills our souls before our God for you,</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.3.10" type="verse">while night and day, with intense earnestness, we pray that we may see your faces, and may bring to perfection whatever may be still lacking in your faith?</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.4.1" type="verse">Moreover, brethren, as you learnt from our lips the lives which you ought to live, and do live, so as to please God, we beg and exhort you in the name of the Lord Jesus to live them more and more truly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.2" type="verse">For you know the commands which we laid upon you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.3" type="verse">For this is God's will--your purity of life, that you abstain from fornication;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.4" type="verse">that each man among you shall know how to procure a  wife who shall be his own in purity and honour;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.5" type="verse">that you be not overmastered by lustful cravings, like the Gentiles who have no knowledge of God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.6" type="verse">and  that in this matter there be no encroaching on the rights of a brother Christian and no overreaching him. For the Lord is an avenger in all such cases, as we have already taught you and solemnly warned you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.7" type="verse">God has not called us to an unclean life, but to one of purity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.8" type="verse">Therefore  a defiant spirit in such a case provokes not man but God, who puts His Holy Spirit into your hearts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.9" type="verse">But on the subject of love for the brotherhood it is unnecessary for me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.10" type="verse">and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. And we exhort you to do so more and more,</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.4.13" type="verse">Now, concerning  those who from time to time pass away, we would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, lest you should mourn as others do who have no hope.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.14" type="verse">For if we believe that Jesus has died and risen again, we also believe that, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who shall have passed away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.15" type="verse">For this we declare to you on the Lord's own authority--that  we who are alive and continue on earth until the Coming of the Lord, shall certainly not forestall those who  shall have previously  passed away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.16" type="verse">For the Lord Himself will come down from Heaven with a loud word of command, and with an archangel's voice and the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.4.17" type="verse">Afterwards we who are alive and are still on earth will be  caught up in their company amid clouds to meet the Lord in the air.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1TH.5.12" type="verse">Now we beg you, brethren, to  show respect for those who labour among you and are your leaders in Christian work, and are your advisers;</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.5.13" type="verse">and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.5.14" type="verse">And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the timid, sustain the weak, and be patient towards all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1TH.5.15" type="verse">See to it that no one ever repays another with evil for evil; but always seek opportunities of doing good both to one another and to all the world.</seg>

          <seg id="b.HEB.2.6" type="verse">But,  as we know, a writer has solemnly said, &amp;lt;"How poor a creature is man, and yet Thou dost remember him, and a son of man, and yet Thou dost come to him!</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.7" type="verse">Thou hast made him only  a little inferior to the angels; with glory and honour Thou hast crowned him,  and hast set him to govern the works of Thy hands.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.8" type="verse">Thou hast put everything in subjection under his feet."&amp;gt; For this subjecting of the universe to man implies the leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not as yet see the universe subject to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.9" type="verse">But Jesus--who was made a little inferior to the angels in order that  through God's grace He might taste death for every human being--we already see wearing a crown of glory and honour because of His having suffered death.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.10" type="verse">For it was fitting that He for whom, and through whom, all things exist, after He had brought  many sons to glory, should perfect by suffering the Prince Leader who had saved them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.11" type="verse">For both He who sanctifies and those whom He is sanctifying have all one Father; and for this reason He is not ashamed to speak of them as His brothers;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.12" type="verse">as when He says: &amp;lt;"I will proclaim Thy name to My brothers:  in the midst of the congregation I will hymn Thy praises;"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.13" type="verse">and again, &amp;lt;"As for Me, I will be one whose trust reposes in God;"&amp;gt; and again, &amp;lt;"Here am I, and here are the children God has given Me."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.14" type="verse">Since then the children referred to are all alike sharers in  perishable human nature, He Himself also, in the same way, took on Him a share of it, in order that through death He might render powerless him who had authority over death, that is, the Devil,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.15" type="verse">and might set at liberty all those who through fear of death had been subject to lifelong slavery.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.16" type="verse">For assuredly it is not to angels that He is continually reaching a helping hand, but it is to the descendants of Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.17" type="verse">And for this purpose it was necessary that in all respects He should be made to resemble His brothers, so that He might become a compassionate and faithful High Priest in things relating to God, in order to atone for the sins of the people.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.2.18" type="verse">For inasmuch as He has Himself felt the pain of  temptation and trial, He is also able instantly to help those who are tempted and tried.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.1" type="verse">Therefore, holy brethren, sharers with others in a heavenly invitation, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whose followers we profess to be.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.2" type="verse">How faithful He was to Him who appointed Him,  just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house!</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.3" type="verse">For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, in so far as  he who has built a house has higher honour than the house itself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.4" type="verse">For every house has had a builder, and the builder of all things is God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.5" type="verse">Moreover, Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant in delivering the message given him to speak;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.6" type="verse">but Christ was faithful as a Son having authority over God's house, and we are that house, if we hold firm to  the End the boldness and the  hope which we boast of as ours.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.7" type="verse">For this reason--as the Holy Spirit warns us,  &amp;lt;"To-day, if you hear His voice,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.8" type="verse">do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the  provocation on the day of the  temptation in the Desert,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.9" type="verse">where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.10" type="verse">Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, `They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.11" type="verse">As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest" --&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.12" type="verse">see to it, brethren, that there is never in any one of you--as perhaps there may be--a sinful and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in revolt from the ever-living God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.13" type="verse">On the contrary  encourage  one another, day after day,  so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through the deceitful character of  sin.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.14" type="verse">For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.15" type="verse">seeing that the warning still comes to us, &amp;lt;"To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.16" type="verse">For who were they  that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not  the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.17" type="verse">And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose  dead bodies fell in the Desert?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.18" type="verse">And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.3.19" type="verse">And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.4" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.1" type="verse">Therefore let us be on our guard lest perhaps, while He still leaves us a promise of being admitted to His rest, some one of you should be found to have fallen short of it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.2" type="verse">For  Good News has been brought to us as truly as to them; but the message they heard failed to benefit them, because they were not one in faith with  those who gave heed to it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.3" type="verse">We who have believed are soon to be admitted to  the true rest; as He has said, &amp;lt;"As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest,"&amp;gt; although God's works had been going on ever since the creation of the world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.4" type="verse">For, as we know, when speaking of the seventh day He has used the words, &amp;lt;"And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.5" type="verse">and He has also declared, &amp;lt;"They shall not be admitted to My rest."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.6" type="verse">Since, then, it is still true that some will be admitted to that rest, and that because of disobedience those  who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them were not admitted,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.7" type="verse">He again definitely mentions a certain day, "To-day," saying long afterwards, by David's lips, in the words already quoted, &amp;lt;"To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.8" type="verse">For if Joshua had given them the true rest,  we should not afterwards hear God speaking of another still future day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.9" type="verse">It follows that there still remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.10" type="verse">For  He who has been admitted to His rest, has rested from His works as God did from His.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.11" type="verse">Let it then be our earnest endeavour to be admitted to that rest, so that no one may perish through following the same example of unbelief.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.12" type="verse">For  God's Message is full of life and power, and is keener than  the sharpest two-edged sword. It pierces even to the severance of soul from spirit, and penetrates between the joints and the marrow, and it can discern the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.13" type="verse">And no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny; but everything lies bare and  completely exposed before the eyes of Him  with whom we have to do.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.14" type="verse">Inasmuch, then, as we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed  into Heaven itself, let us hold firmly to our profession of faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.15" type="verse">For we have not a High Priest who is unable to feel for us in our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in every respect just as we are tempted, and yet did not sin.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.4.16" type="verse">Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our times of need.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.5" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.1" type="verse">For every  High Priest is chosen from among men, and is appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to God, in order to offer both  gifts and sin-offerings,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.2" type="verse">and must be one who is able to bear patiently with the ignorant and erring, because he himself also is beset with infirmity.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.3" type="verse">And for this reason he is required to offer sin-offerings not only for the people but also for himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.4" type="verse">And no one takes this  honourable office upon himself, but only accepts it when called to it by God, as Aaron was.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.5" type="verse">So Christ also did not claim for Himself the honour of being made High Priest, but was appointed to it by Him who said to Him, &amp;lt;"My Son art Thou: I have to-day become Thy Father;"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.6" type="verse">as also in another passage He says, &amp;lt;"Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.7" type="verse">For Jesus during his earthly life offered up prayers and entreaties, crying aloud and weeping as He pleaded with Him who was able to bring Him in safety out of death, and He was delivered  from the terror from which He shrank.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.8" type="verse">Although He was God's Son, yet He learned obedience from the sufferings which He endured;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.9" type="verse">and so, having been  made perfect, He became to all who obey Him the  source and giver of eternal salvation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.10" type="verse">For God Himself  addresses Him as a High Priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.11" type="verse">Concerning Him we have much to say, and much that it would be difficult to make clear to you, since you have become  so dull of apprehension.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.12" type="verse">For although, considering the long time you have been believers, you ought now to be teachers of others, you really need some one to teach you over again the very rudiments of the truths of God, and you have come to require milk instead of solid food.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.13" type="verse">By people who live on milk I mean those who are imperfectly acquainted with the  teaching concerning righteousness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.5.14" type="verse">Such persons are mere babes. But solid food  is for adults--that is, for those who through constant practice have their spiritual faculties carefully trained to distinguish good from evil.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.6" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.1" type="verse">Therefore leaving elementary instruction about the Christ, let us advance to mature manhood and not be continually re-laying a foundation of repentance from  lifeless works and of  faith in God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.2" type="verse">or of teaching about  ceremonial washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection  of the dead, and  the last judgement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.3" type="verse">And advance we will, if God permits us to do so.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.4" type="verse">For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once for all been enlightened, and have tasted the sweetness of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.5" type="verse">and have realized how good the word of God is and how mighty are the powers of the coming Age, and then fell away--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.6" type="verse">it is impossible, I say, to keep bringing them back to a new repentance, for,  to their own undoing, they are repeatedly crucifying the Son of God afresh and exposing Him to open shame.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.7" type="verse">For land which has drunk in the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sakes, indeed, it is tilled, has a share in God's blessing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.8" type="verse">But if it only yields a mass of thorns and briers, it is considered worthless, and is in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be destroyed by fire.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.9" type="verse">But we, even while we speak in this tone, have a happier conviction concerning you, my dearly-loved friends--a conviction of things which point towards salvation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.10" type="verse">For God is not unjust so that He is unmindful of your labour and of the love which you have manifested towards Himself in having rendered services to His people and in still rendering them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.11" type="verse">But we long for each of you to continue to manifest the same earnestness, with a view to your enjoying fulness of hope to the very End;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.12" type="verse">so that you may not  become half-hearted, but be imitators of those who through faith and patient endurance are now heirs to the promises.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.13" type="verse">For when God gave the promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.14" type="verse">saying, &amp;lt;"Assuredly I will bless you and bless you, I will increase you and increase you."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.15" type="verse">And so, as the result of patient waiting, our forefather obtained what God had promised.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.16" type="verse">For men swear by what is greater than themselves; and with them an oath in confirmation of a statement always puts an end to a dispute.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.17" type="verse">In the same way, since it was God's desire to display more convincingly to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable His purpose was,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.18" type="verse">He added an oath, in order that, through  two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for Him to prove false, we may possess mighty encouragement--we who, for safety, have hastened to lay hold of the hope set before us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.19" type="verse">That hope we have as an anchor of the soul--an anchor that can neither break nor drag. It passes in behind the veil,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.6.20" type="verse">where Jesus has entered as  a forerunner  on our behalf, having become, like Melchizedek, a High Priest for ever.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.7" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.1" type="verse">For this man, Melchizedek, King of Salem and priest of the Most High God--he who when Abraham was returning after defeating the kings met him and pronounced a blessing on him--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.2" type="verse">to whom also Abraham presented a tenth part of all--being first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and secondly King of Salem, that is, King of peace:</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.3" type="verse">with no father or mother, and no record of ancestry: having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made a type of the Son of God--this man Melchizedek remains a priest for ever.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.4" type="verse">Now think how great this priest-king must have been to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth part of the best of the spoil.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.5" type="verse">And those of the descendants of Levi who receive the priesthood are authorized by the Law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these have sprung from Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.6" type="verse">But, in this instance, one who does not trace his origin from them takes tithes from Abraham, and pronounces a blessing on him to whom the promises belong.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.7" type="verse">And beyond all dispute it is always the inferior who is blessed by the superior.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.8" type="verse">Moreover  here frail mortal men receive tithes: there one receives them about whom there is evidence that he is alive.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.9" type="verse">And Levi too--if I may so speak--pays tithes through Abraham:</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.10" type="verse">for Levi was yet in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met Abraham.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.11" type="verse">Now if  the crowning blessing was attainable by means of the Levitical priesthood--for  as resting on this foundation the people received the Law,  to which they are still subject--  what further need was there for a Priest of a different kind to be raised up belonging to the order of Melchizedek instead of being said to belong to the order of Aaron?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.12" type="verse">For when the priesthood changes, a change of Law also of necessity takes place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.13" type="verse">He, however, to whom that prophecy refers  is associated with a different tribe, not one member of which has anything to do with the altar.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.14" type="verse">For it is undeniable that our Lord sprang from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing in connection with priests.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.15" type="verse">And this is still more abundantly clear when we read that it is as belonging to the order of Melchizedek that a priest of a different kind is to arise,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.16" type="verse">and hold His office not in obedience to any temporary Law, but by virtue of an indestructible Life.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.17" type="verse">For the words are in evidence, &amp;lt;"Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.18" type="verse">On the one hand we have here the abrogation of an earlier code because it was weak and ineffective--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.19" type="verse">for the Law brought no perfect blessing--but on the other hand we have the bringing in of a new and better hope by means of which we draw near to God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.20" type="verse">And since  it was not without an oath being taken--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.21" type="verse">for these men hold office without any oath having been taken, but He holds it attested by an oath from Him who said to Him, &amp;lt;"The Lord has sworn and will not  recall His words, Thou art a Priest for ever" --&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.22" type="verse">so much the more also is the Covenant of which Jesus has become the  guarantor, a better covenant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.23" type="verse">And they have been appointed priests many in number, because death prevents their continuance in office:</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.24" type="verse">but He, because He continues for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass to any successor.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.25" type="verse">Hence too He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, seeing that He ever lives to plead for them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.26" type="verse">Moreover we needed just such a High Priest as this--holy, guileless, undefiled, far removed from sinful men and exalted above the heavens;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.27" type="verse">who, unlike other High Priests, is not under the necessity of offering up sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and afterwards for those of the people; for this latter thing He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.7.28" type="verse">For the Law constitutes men High Priests--men with all their infirmity--but the utterance of the oath, which came later than the Law, constitutes High Priest a Son who has been made for ever perfect.</seg>

        <div id="b.HEB.8" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.1" type="verse">Now in connexion with what we have been saying the chief point is that we have a High Priest who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of God's Majesty in the heavens,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.2" type="verse">and ministers in the Holy place and in the true tabernacle which not man, but the Lord pitched.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.3" type="verse">Every High Priest,  however, is appointed to offer both bloodless gifts and sacrifices. Therefore this High Priest also must have some offering to present.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.4" type="verse">If then He were still on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since  here there are already those who present the offerings in obedience to the Law,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.5" type="verse">and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things, just as Moses was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle. For God said, &amp;lt;"See that you make everything in imitation of the pattern shown you on the mountain."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.6" type="verse">But, as a matter of fact, the ministry which Christ has obtained is all the nobler a ministry, in that He is at the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant, based upon sublimer promises.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.7" type="verse">For if that first Covenant had been free from imperfection, there would have been no attempt to introduce another.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.8" type="verse">For, being dissatisfied with His people, God says, &amp;lt;"`There are days coming,' says the Lord, `When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new Covenant--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.9" type="verse">a Covenant unlike the one which I made with their forefathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they would not remain faithful to  that.' `So I turned from them,' says the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.10" type="verse">`But this is the Covenant that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days,' says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts. And I will indeed be their God and they shall be My People.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.11" type="verse">And there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord. For all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.12" type="verse">Because I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and their sins I will remember no longer.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.8.13" type="verse">By using the words, "a new Covenant," He has made the first one obsolete; but whatever is decaying and showing signs of old age is not far from disappearing altogether.</seg>

        <div id="b.HEB.9" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.1" type="verse">Now even  the first Covenant had regulations for divine worship, and had also its sanctuary--a sanctuary belonging to this world.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.2" type="verse">For a sacred tent was constructed--the  outer one, in which were the lamp and the table and  the presented loaves; and this is called  the Holy place.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.3" type="verse">And behind the second veil was a sacred tent called the  Holy of holies.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.4" type="verse">This had a  censer of gold, and the ark of the Covenant lined with gold and completely covered with gold, and in it were a gold vase which held the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded and the tables of the Covenant.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.5" type="verse">And above the ark were the Cherubim  denoting God's glorious presence and overshadowing the Mercy-seat. But I cannot now speak about all these in detail.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.6" type="verse">These arrangements having long been completed, the priests, when conducting the divine services, continually enter the outer tent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.7" type="verse">But into the second, the High Priest goes only on one day of the year, and goes alone, taking with him blood, which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins which the people have ignorantly committed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.8" type="verse">And the lesson which the Holy Spirit teaches is this--that the way into the  true  Holy place is not yet open  so long as the outer tent still remains in existence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.9" type="verse">And this is a figure--for the time now present--answering to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, unable though they are to give complete freedom from sin to him who ministers.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.10" type="verse">For their efficacy depends only on meats and drinks and various washings, ceremonies pertaining to the body and imposed until a time of reformation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.11" type="verse">But Christ  appeared as a High Priest of the blessings  that are soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect Tent of worship, a tent which has not been built with hands--that is to say does not belong to this material creation--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.12" type="verse">and once for all entered  the Holy place, taking with Him not the blood of goats and calves, but His own blood, and thus procuring eternal redemption for us.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.13" type="verse">For if  the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them holy so as to bring about  ceremonial purity,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.14" type="verse">how much more certainly shall the blood of Christ, who  strengthened by  the eternal Spirit  offered Himself to God, free from blemish, purify  your consciences from  lifeless works for you to  serve the  ever-living God?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.15" type="verse">And because of this He is the negotiator of a new Covenant, in order that, since a life has been given in atonement for the offences committed under the first Covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance which has been promised to them.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.16" type="verse">For where there is a  legal `will,' there must also be a death brought forward in evidence--the death of him who made it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.17" type="verse">And a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person, being never of any avail so long as he who made it lives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.18" type="verse">Accordingly  we find that the first Covenant was not inaugurated without blood.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.19" type="verse">For when Moses had proclaimed  to all the people  every commandment contained in the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats and with them water, scarlet wool and hyssop, and  sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.20" type="verse">saying, &amp;lt;"This is the blood which confirms the Covenant that God has made binding upon you."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.21" type="verse">And in the same way  he also sprinkled blood upon the Tent of worship and upon all the vessels used in the ministry.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.22" type="verse">Indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the Law everything is sprinkled with blood, and that apart from  the outpouring of blood there is no remission of sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.23" type="verse">It was needful therefore that the copies of the things in Heaven should be cleansed in this way, but that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with more costly sacrifices.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.24" type="verse">For not into a  Holy place built by men's hands--a mere copy of the reality--did Christ enter, but He entered Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.25" type="verse">Nor did He enter for the purpose of many times offering Himself in sacrifice, just as the High Priest enters the  Holy place, year after year, taking with him blood not his own.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.26" type="verse">In that case Christ would have needed to suffer many times, from the creation of the world onwards; but as a matter of fact He has appeared once for all, at  the Close of the Ages, in order to do away with sin by  the sacrifice of Himself.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.27" type="verse">And since it is reserved for all mankind once to die, and afterwards to be judged;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.9.28" type="verse">so the Christ also, having been once offered in sacrifice in order that He might bear the sins of  many, will appear a second time,  separated from sin,  to those who are eagerly expecting Him, to make their salvation complete.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.HEB.10" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.1" type="verse">For, since the Law exhibits only an outline of the blessings to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves,  the priests can never, by repeating the same sacrifices which they continually offer year after year, give complete freedom from sin to those who draw near.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.2" type="verse">For then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the consciences of the worshippers--who in that case would now have been cleansed once for all--would no longer be burdened with sins?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.3" type="verse">But in those sacrifices sins are recalled to memory year after year.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.4" type="verse">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.5" type="verse">That is why, when He comes into the world, He says, &amp;lt;"Sacrifice and offering Thou has not desired, but a body Thou hast prepared for Me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.6" type="verse">In whole burnt-offerings and in sin-offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.7" type="verse">Then I said, `I have come--in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me--to do Thy will, O God.'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.8" type="verse">After saying the words I have just quoted, &amp;lt;"Sacrifices and offerings or whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings Thou hast not desired or taken pleasure in"&amp;gt; --all such being offered in obedience to the Law--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.9" type="verse">He then  adds, &amp;lt;"I have come to do Thy will."&amp;gt; He does away with the first in order to establish the second.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.10" type="verse">It is through that divine will that we  have been set free from sin, through the offering of Jesus Christ as our sacrifice once for all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.11" type="verse">And while every  priest stands ministering, day after day, and constantly offering the same sacrifices--though such can never rid us of our sins--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.12" type="verse">this Priest, on the contrary, after offering for sins a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy, took His seat at God's right hand,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.13" type="verse">waiting from that time onward until His enemies be put as a footstool under His feet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.14" type="verse">For by a single offering He has for ever completed the blessing for those whom He is setting free from sin.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.15" type="verse">And the Holy Spirit also gives us His testimony; for when He had said,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.16" type="verse">&amp;lt;"`This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord: `I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;'"&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.17" type="verse">He adds, &amp;lt;"And their sins and offences I will remember no longer."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.18" type="verse">But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.19" type="verse">Since then, brethren, we have  free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.20" type="verse">by the new and  ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil--that is to say, of His earthly nature--</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.21" type="verse">and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.22" type="verse">let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from consciences oppressed with sin, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.23" type="verse">Let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope, for He is faithful who gave us the promises.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.24" type="verse">And let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing one another to brotherly love and right conduct;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.25" type="verse">not neglecting--as some habitually do--to meet together, but encouraging one another, and doing this all the more since you can see  the day of Christ approaching.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.26" type="verse">For if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains in reserve any other sacrifice for sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.27" type="verse">There remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement, and the fury of a fire which before long will  devour  the enemies of the truth.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.28" type="verse">Any one who bids defiance to the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.29" type="verse">How much  severer punishment, think you, will he be held to deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, has not regarded as holy that Covenant-blood with which he was set free from sin, and has insulted the Spirit from whom comes grace?</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.30" type="verse">For we know who it is that has said, &amp;lt;"Vengeance belongs to Me: I will pay back;"&amp;gt; and again, &amp;lt;"The Lord will be His people's judge."&amp;gt;</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.31" type="verse">It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the  ever-living God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.32" type="verse">But continually recall to mind the days now past, when on being first enlightened you went through a great conflict and many sufferings.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.33" type="verse">This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings of those who were thus treated.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.34" type="verse">For you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned, but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken from you, being well aware  that you have in your own selves a more valuable possession and one which will remain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.35" type="verse">Therefore do not cast from you your confident hope, for it will receive a vast reward.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.36" type="verse">For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.37" type="verse">For there is still but a short time and then &amp;lt;"The coming One will come and will not delay.</seg>
          <seg id="b.HEB.10.38" type="verse">But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him."&amp;gt;</seg>

          <seg id="b.HEB.11.1" type="verse">Now  faith is a well-grounded assurance of that for which we hope, and a conviction of the reality of things which we do not see.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.1.10" type="verse">but a rich man should rejoice in being brought low, for like flowers among the herbage rich men will pass away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.11" type="verse">The sun rises with his scorching heat and dries up the herbage, so that its flowers drop off and the beauty of its appearance perishes, and in the same way rich men with all their prosperity will fade away.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.12" type="verse">Blessed is he who patiently endures  trials; for when he has stood the test, he will gain the victor's crown--even the  crown of Life--which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.13" type="verse">Let no one say when passing through  trial, "My temptation is from God;" for God is incapable of being tempted to do evil, and He Himself tempts no one.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.14" type="verse">But when a man is tempted, it is his own passions that carry him away and  serve as a bait.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.15" type="verse">Then  the passion conceives, and becomes the parent of sin; and sin,  when fully matured, gives birth to death.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.1.17" type="verse">Every gift which is good, and every perfect boon, is from above, and comes down from the Father, who is the source of all Light. In Him there is no variation nor the slightest suggestion of change.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.1.20" type="verse">For a man's anger does not lead to action which God regards as righteous.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.21" type="verse">Ridding yourselves, therefore, of all that is vile and of the evil influences which prevail around you, welcome in a humble spirit the Message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.22" type="verse">But prove yourselves obedient to the Message, and do not be mere hearers of it, imposing a delusion upon yourselves.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.23" type="verse">For if any one listens but does not obey, he is like a man who carefully looks at  his own face in a mirror.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.24" type="verse">Although he  has looked carefully at himself, he goes away, and has immediately forgotten the sort of man  he is.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.25" type="verse">But he who  looks closely into the perfect Law--the Law of freedom--and continues looking, he, being not a hearer who forgets, but an obedient doer, will as the result of his obedience be blessed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.26" type="verse">If a man  thinks that he is scrupulously religious, although he is not curbing his tongue but is deceiving  himself, his religious service is worthless.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.1.27" type="verse">The religious service which is pure and stainless in the sight of our God and Father is to visit fatherless children and widowed women in their time of trouble, and to keep one's own self unspotted from the world.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.2.4" type="verse">is it not plain that in your hearts you  have little faith, seeing that you have become judges full of wrong thoughts?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.5" type="verse">Listen, my dearly-loved brethren. Has not God chosen those whom the world regards as poor to be rich in faith and heirs of  the Kingdom which He has promised to those that love Him?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.6" type="verse">But *you* have put dishonour upon the poor man. Yet is it not the rich who grind you down? Are not they the very people who drag you into the Law courts? --</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.2.8" type="verse">If, however, you are keeping the Law  as supreme, in obedience to the Commandment which says &amp;lt;"You are to love your fellow man just as you love yourself,"&amp;gt; you are acting rightly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.9" type="verse">But if you are making distinctions between one man and another, you are guilty of sin, and are convicted by the Law as offenders.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.10" type="verse">A man who has kept the Law as a whole, but has  failed to keep some one command, has become guilty of violating all.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.11" type="verse">For He who said, &amp;lt;"Do not commit adultery,"&amp;gt; also said, &amp;lt;"Do not commit murder,"&amp;gt; and if you are a murderer, although not an adulterer, you have become an offender against the Law.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.12" type="verse">Speak and act as those should who are expecting to be judged by the Law of freedom.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.13" type="verse">For he who shows no mercy will have judgement given against him without mercy; but mercy triumphs over judgement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.14" type="verse">What good is it, my brethren, if a man professes to have faith, and yet his actions do not correspond? Can such faith save him?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.15" type="verse">Suppose a Christian brother or sister is poorly clad or lacks daily food,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.16" type="verse">and one of you says  to them,  "I wish you well;  keep yourselves warm and well fed," and yet you do not give them what they need; what is the use of that?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.17" type="verse">So also faith, if it is unaccompanied by obedience, has no life in it--so long as it stands alone.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.18" type="verse">Nay, some one will say, "You have faith, I have actions: prove to me your faith apart from corresponding actions and I will prove mine to you by my actions.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.19" type="verse">You believe that  God is one, and you are quite right: evil spirits also believe this, and shudder."</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.20" type="verse">But, idle boaster, are you willing to be taught how it is that faith apart from obedience is worthless? Take the case of Abraham our forefather.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.21" type="verse">Was it, or was it not, because of his actions that he was declared to be righteous as the result of his having offered up his son Isaac upon the altar?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.22" type="verse">You notice that his faith was co-operating with his actions, and that by his actions his faith was perfected;</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.23" type="verse">and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &amp;lt;"And Abraham believed God, and his faith was placed to his credit as righteousness,"&amp;gt; and he received the name of `God's friend.'</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.24" type="verse">You all see that it is because of actions that a man is pronounced righteous, and not simply because of faith.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.25" type="verse">In the same way also was not the notorious sinner Rahab declared to be righteous because of her actions when she welcomed the  spies and hurriedly helped them to escape another way?</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.2.26" type="verse">For  just as a human body without a spirit is lifeless, so also faith is lifeless if it is unaccompanied by obedience.</seg>

          <seg id="b.JAM.5.3" type="verse">your gold and your silver have become covered with rust, and the rust on them will give evidence against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded up wealth in  these last days.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.4" type="verse">I tell you that the pay of the labourers who have gathered in your crops--pay which you are keeping back--is calling out against you; and the outcries of those who have been your reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of the armies of Heaven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.5" type="verse">Here on earth you have lived self-indulgent and profligate lives. You have  stupefied yourselves with gross feeding; but a day of slaughter has come.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.6" type="verse">You have condemned--you have murdered--  the righteous man: he offers no resistance.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.7" type="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, until the Coming of the Lord. Notice how eagerly a farmer waits for a valuable crop! He is patient over it till it has received the early and the later rain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.8" type="verse">So you also must be patient: keeping up your courage; for the Coming of the Lord is now close at hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.9" type="verse">Do not cry out in condemnation of one another, brethren, lest you come under judgement. I tell you that the Judge is standing at the door.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.10" type="verse">In illustration, brethren, of persecution patiently endured take the Prophets who have spoken as messengers from the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.11" type="verse">Remember that we call those blessed who endured what they did. You have also heard of Job's patient endurance, and have seen the issue of the Lord's dealings with him--how full of tenderness and pity the Lord is.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.12" type="verse">But above all things, my brethren,  do not swear, either by Heaven or by the earth, or with any other oath. Let your `yes' be simply `yes,' and your `no' be simply `no;' that you may not come under condemnation.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.13" type="verse">Is one of you suffering? Let him pray. Is any one in good spirits? Let him sing a psalm.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.14" type="verse">Is any one ill? Let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him,  after anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.15" type="verse">And the prayer of faith will restore the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up to health; and if he  has committed sins, they shall be forgiven.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.16" type="verse">Therefore  confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. The  heartfelt supplication of a righteous man exerts a mighty influence.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.17" type="verse">Elijah was a man with a nature similar to ours, and he earnestly prayed that there might be no rain: and no rain fell on the land for three years and six months.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.18" type="verse">Again he prayed, and the sky gave rain and the land yielded its crops.</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.19" type="verse">My brethren, if one of you strays from the truth and some one brings him back,</seg>
          <seg id="b.JAM.5.20" type="verse">let him know that he who brings a sinner back from his evil ways will save the man's soul from death and throw a veil over a multitude of sins.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1PE.1.7" type="verse">The sorrow comes in order that the testing of your faith--being more  precious than that of gold, which perishes and yet  is proved by fire--may be found to result in praise and glory and honour at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1PE.1.8" type="verse">Him you love, though  your eyes have never looked on Him. In Him, though at present you cannot see Him, you nevertheless trust, and triumph with a joy which is unspeakable and is crowned with glory,</seg>

Angels long to  stoop and look into these things.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1PE.3.3" type="verse">Your adornment ought not to be a merely outward thing--one of plaiting the hair,  putting on jewelry, or wearing beautiful dresses.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1PE.3.4" type="verse">Instead of that, it should be  a new nature within--the imperishable ornament of a gentle and peaceful spirit, which is indeed precious in the sight of God.</seg>
          <seg id="b.1PE.3.5" type="verse">For in ancient times also this was the way the holy women who set their hopes upon God used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their husbands.</seg>

          <seg id="b.2PE.1.1" type="verse">Simon Peter, a bondservant and Apostle of Jesus Christ: To those to whom there has been allotted the same precious faith as that which is ours through the righteousness  of our God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.2" type="verse">May more and more grace and peace be granted to you  in a full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.3" type="verse">seeing that His divine power has given us all things that are needful for life and godliness, through our knowledge of Him who has appealed to us  by His own glorious perfections.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.4" type="verse">It is by means of these that He has granted us His precious and  wondrous promises, in order that through them you may,  one and all, become sharers in the very nature of God, having completely escaped the corruption which exists in the world through earthly cravings.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.5" type="verse">But for this very reason--adding, on your part, all earnestness--  along with your faith,  manifest  also  a noble character: along with a noble character, knowledge;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.6" type="verse">along with knowledge,  self-control; along with self-control, power of endurance;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.7" type="verse">along with power of endurance, godliness; along with godliness, brotherly affection; and along with brotherly affection, love.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.8" type="verse">If these things exist in you, and continually increase, they prevent your being either idle or unfruitful in advancing towards a full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.9" type="verse">For the man in whom they are lacking is blind and cannot see distant objects,  in that he has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.10" type="verse">For this reason, brethren, be all the more in earnest to  make sure that God has called you and chosen you; for it is certain that so long as you practise these things, you will never stumble.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.11" type="verse">And so  a triumphant admission into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will be freely granted to you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.12" type="verse">For this reason I shall always persist in reminding you of these things, although you know them and are stedfast believers in truth which you already possess.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.13" type="verse">But I think it right, so long as I remain in  the body, my present dwelling-place, to arouse you by such reminders.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.14" type="verse">For I know that the time for me to lay aside  my body is now rapidly drawing near, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has revealed to me.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.15" type="verse">So  on every possible occasion I will  also do my best to enable you to recall these things after my departure.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.16" type="verse">For when we made known to you the power and Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not eagerly following cleverly devised legends, but we had been eye-witnesses of His majesty.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.17" type="verse">He received honour and glory from God the Father, and out of the wondrous glory words such as these were  spoken to Him, "This is My dearly-loved Son, in whom  I take delight."</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.18" type="verse">And we ourselves heard these words  come from Heaven, when we were with Him on the holy mountain.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.19" type="verse">And in the written word of prophecy we have  something more permanent; to which  you do well to pay attention--as to a lamp shining in a dimly-lighted place--until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.20" type="verse">But, above all, remember that no prophecy in Scripture will be found to have come from the prophet's own prompting;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.1.21" type="verse">for never did any prophecy come by human will, but  men sent by God spoke as they were  impelled by the Holy Spirit.</seg>
        </div>
        <div id="b.2PE.2" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.1" type="verse">But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be teachers of falsehood among you also, who will cunningly introduce fatal  divisions, disowning even the Sovereign Lord who has redeemed them,  and bringing on themselves swift destruction.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.2" type="verse">And in their immoral ways they will have many eager disciples, through whom religion will be brought into disrepute.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.3" type="verse">Thirsting for riches, they will trade on you with their canting talk. From of old their judgement  has been working itself out, and their destruction  has not been slumbering.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.4" type="verse">For God did not spare angels when they had sinned, but hurling them down to Tartarus consigned them to  caves of darkness, keeping them in readiness for judgement.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.5" type="verse">And He did not spare the ancient world, although He preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a deluge on the world of the ungodly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.6" type="verse">He reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and condemned them to overthrow, making them an example to people who might  in future be living godless lives.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.7" type="verse">But when righteous Lot was sore distressed by the gross misconduct of immoral men He rescued him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.8" type="verse">(For their lawless deeds were torture, day after day, to the pure soul of that righteous man--all that he saw and heard whilst living in their midst.)</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.9" type="verse">Since all this is so, the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from temptation, and on the other hand how to keep the unrighteous under punishment in readiness for the Day of Judgement,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.10" type="verse">and especially those who are abandoned to sensuality--craving, as they do, for polluted things, and scorning control.  Fool-hardy and self-willed, they do not tremble when speaking evil of glorious beings;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.11" type="verse">while angels, though greater than they in might and power, do not bring any insulting accusation against such  in the presence of the Lord.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.12" type="verse">But these men, like brute beasts, created (with their natural instincts) only to be captured  or destroyed, are abusive in matters of which they are ignorant, and in their corruption will perish,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.13" type="verse">being  doomed to receive a requital for their guilt. They reckon it pleasure to feast daintily in broad  daylight. They are spots and blemishes, while feeding luxuriously at their  love-feasts, and banqueting with you.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.14" type="verse">Their very eyes are full of adultery--being eyes which never cease from sin. These men set traps to catch unstedfast souls, their own hearts being well trained in greed.  They are fore-doomed to God's curse!</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.15" type="verse">Forsaking the straight road, they have gone astray,  having eagerly followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was bent on securing the wages of unrighteousness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.16" type="verse">But he was rebuked for his transgression: a dumb  ass spoke with a human voice and checked the madness of the Prophet.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.17" type="verse">These people are wells without water, mists driven along by a storm, men for whom the dense darkness has been reserved.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.18" type="verse">For, while they pour out their frivolous and arrogant talk, they use earthly cravings--every kind of immorality--as a  bait to entrap men who are just escaping from the influence of those who live in error.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.19" type="verse">And  they promise them freedom, although they are themselves the slaves of what is corrupt. For a man is the slave of  any one by whom he has been worsted in fight.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.20" type="verse">For if, after escaping from the pollutions of the world through a full knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, people are once more entangled in these pollutions and are overcome, their last state has become worse than their first.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.21" type="verse">For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandments in which they were instructed.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.2.22" type="verse">Their case is that described in the true proverb, &amp;lt;"A dog returns to what he has vomited,"&amp;gt; and also in the other proverb, "The sow has washed itself and now goes back to roll  in its filth."</seg>

        <div id="b.2PE.3" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.1" type="verse">This letter which I am now writing to you, dear friends, is my second letter. In both my letters I seek to revive in your honest minds the memory of certain things,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.2" type="verse">so that you may recall the words spoken long ago by the holy Prophets, and the commandments of our Lord and Saviour given you through your Apostles.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.3" type="verse">But, above all, remember that, in  the last days, men will come who make a mock at everything--men governed only by their own passions,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.4" type="verse">and, asking, "What has become of His promised  Return? For from the time our forefathers fell asleep all things continue as they have been ever since the creation of the world."</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.5" type="verse">For they are wilfully blind to the fact that there were heavens which existed of old, and an earth, the latter  arising out of water and extending continuously through water, by the command of God;</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.6" type="verse">and that,  by means of these, the then existing race of men was overwhelmed with water and perished.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.7" type="verse">But the present heavens and the present earth are,  by the command of the same God, kept stored up, reserved for fire in preparation for  a day of judgement and of destruction for the ungodly.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.8" type="verse">But there is one thing, dear friends, which you must not forget. With the Lord  one day resembles a thousand years and a thousand years resemble one day.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.9" type="verse">The Lord is not slow in fulfilling His promise, in the sense in which some men speak of slowness. But He bears patiently with you, His desire being that no one should perish but that all should come to repentance.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.10" type="verse">The day of the Lord will come like a thief--it will be a day on which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, the elements be  destroyed in the fierce heat, and the earth and all the works of man be  utterly burnt up.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.11" type="verse">Since all these things are thus pre-destined to dissolution,  what sort of men ought you to be found to be in all holy living and godly conduct,</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.12" type="verse">eagerly looking forward to the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens, all ablaze,  will be destroyed, and the elements will melt in the fierce heat?</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.13" type="verse">But in accordance with His promise we are expecting  new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness will  dwell.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.14" type="verse">Therefore, dear friends, since you have these expectations, earnestly seek to be found in His presence, free from blemish or reproach, in peace.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.15" type="verse">And  always regard the patient forbearance of our Lord as salvation, as our dear brother Paul also has written to you in virtue of the wisdom granted to him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.16" type="verse">That is what he says in all his letters, when speaking in them of these things. In those letters there are some statements hard to understand, which ill-taught and unprincipled people pervert, just as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.17" type="verse">You, therefore, dear friends, having been warned beforehand, must  continually be on your guard so as not to be led astray by the false teaching of immoral men nor fall from your own stedfastness.</seg>
          <seg id="b.2PE.3.18" type="verse">But be  always growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be all glory, both now and to the day  of Eternity!</seg>

          <seg id="b.1JO.2.7" type="verse">My dearly-loved friends, it is no new command that I am now giving you, but an old command which you have had from the very beginning. By the old command I mean the teaching which you have already received.</seg>

          <seg id="b.1JO.4.18" type="verse">Love has in it no element of fear; but  perfect love drives away fear, because fear involves pain, and if a man gives way to fear, there is something imperfect in his love.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.9.3" type="verse">And from the midst of the smoke there came  locusts on to the  earth, and power was given to them resembling the power which earthly scorpions possess.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.9.4" type="verse">And they were forbidden to injure the herbage of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree. They were only to injure human beings--those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.9.5" type="verse">Their mission was not to kill, but to cause awful agony for  five months; and this agony was like that which a scorpion inflicts when it stings a man.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.11.15" type="verse">The seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed loud voices in Heaven which said, "The sovereignty of the world  now belongs to our Lord and His Christ; and He will be King until the Ages of the Ages."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.11.16" type="verse">Then the twenty-four Elders, who sit on thrones in the presence of God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.11.19" type="verse">Then the doors of God's sanctuary in Heaven were opened, and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary; and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.12.3" type="verse">And another marvel was seen in Heaven--a  great  fiery-red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns; and on his heads were seven kingly crowns.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.12.4" type="verse">His tail was drawing after it a third part of the stars of Heaven, and it dashed them to the ground. And in front of the woman who was about to become a mother, the Dragon was standing in order to devour the child as soon as it was born.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.12.11" type="verse">But they have gained the victory over him because of the blood of the Lamb and of the testimony which they have borne, and because they held their lives cheap and did not shrink even from death.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.15.3" type="verse">And  they were singing the song of Moses, God's  servant, and the song of the Lamb. Their words were, "Great and wonderful are Thy works, O Lord God, the Ruler of all. Righteous and true are Thy ways, O King of  the nations.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.16.1" type="verse">Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels, "Go and pour on to the  earth the seven bowls of the anger of God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.16.2" type="verse">So the first angel went away and poured his bowl on to the earth; and  it brought  a bad and painful sore upon the men who had on them the mark of the Wild Beast and worshipped his statue.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.17.9" type="verse">Here is scope for the exercise of a mind that has wisdom! The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman sits.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.21.9" type="verse">Then there came one of the seven angels who were carrying the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues. "Come with me," he said, "and I will show you  the Bride, the Lamb's wife."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.10" type="verse">So in the Spirit he carried me to the top of a vast, lofty mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God,</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.11" type="verse">and  bringing with it  the glory of God. It shone with a radiance like that of a very precious stone--such as a jasper, bright and transparent.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.12" type="verse">It has a wall, massive and high, with twelve large gates, and  in charge of the gates were twelve angels. And overhead, above the gates, names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the descendants of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.13" type="verse">There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.14" type="verse">The wall of the city had  twelve foundation stones, and engraved upon them were twelve names--the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.15" type="verse">Now he who was speaking to me had a measuring-rod of gold, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.16" type="verse">The plan of the city is  a square, the length being the same as the breadth; and he measured the city  furlong by furlong, with his measuring rod--it is twelve hundred  miles long, and the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.17" type="verse">And he  measured the wall of it--a wall of a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to human measure, which was also that of the angel.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.18" type="verse">The  solid fabric of the wall was jasper; and the city itself was made of gold,  resembling transparent glass.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.19" type="verse">As for the foundation-stones of the city wall, which were beautified with various kinds of precious stones, the first was jasper, the second  sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius,</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.20" type="verse">the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.21" type="verse">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each of them consisting of a single pearl. And the main street of the city was made of  pure gold, resembling transparent glass.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.22" type="verse">I saw no sanctuary in the city, for the Lord God, the Ruler of all, is its Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.23" type="verse">Nor has the city any need of the sun or of the moon, to give it light; for the glory of God has shone upon it and  its lamp is the Lamb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.24" type="verse">The nations will live their lives by its light; and the kings of the earth are to bring their glory into it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.25" type="verse">And in the daytime (for there will be no night there) the gates will never be closed;</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.26" type="verse">and the glory and honor of the nations shall be brought into it.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.21.27" type="verse">And no unclean thing shall ever enter it, nor any one who is guilty of base conduct or tells lies, but only they whose names stand recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life.</seg>

        <div id="b.REV.22" type="chapter">
          <seg id="b.REV.22.1" type="verse">Then he showed me the river of the Water of Life, bright as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.2" type="verse">On either side of the river,  midway between it and the main street of the city, was  the Tree of Life. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, yielding a fresh crop month by month, and the leaves of the tree served as medicine for the nations.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.3" type="verse">"In future there will be no  curse," he said, "but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be  in that city. And His  servants will render Him holy service and will see His face,</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.4" type="verse">and His  name will be on their foreheads.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.5" type="verse">And there will be no night there; and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will shine upon them, and they will be kings until the Ages of the Ages."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.6" type="verse">And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the Prophets, sent His angel to make known to His  servants the things which must soon happen.</seg>

          <seg id="b.REV.22.8" type="verse">I John heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and seen them, I fell at the feet of the angel who was showing me them--to worship him.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.9" type="verse">But he said to me, "Oh, do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of yours, and a fellow bondservant of your brethren the Prophets and of those who are mindful of the teachings of this book. Worship God."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.10" type="verse">"Make no secret," he added, "of the meaning of the predictions contained in this book; for the time for their fulfillment is now close at hand.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.11" type="verse">Let the dishonest man act dishonestly  still; let the filthy make himself filthy  still; let the righteous practise righteousness  still; and let the holy be made holy  still."</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.12" type="verse">"I am coming quickly; and My reward is with Me, that I may requite every man in accordance with what his conduct has been.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.13" type="verse">I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</seg>
          <seg id="b.REV.22.14" type="verse">Blessed are those who  wash their robes clean, that they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and may go through the gates into the city.</seg>
