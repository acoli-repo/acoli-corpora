Unbound Bibles (http://unbound.biola.edu/)
--------------

- retrieval via get-unbound-bibles.sh
- conversion using WorldBible2CES
- metadata post-corrections using prep-for-github.sh

Note that the copyright hasn't been cleared by us, and the files are redistributed unlicensed but under fair use conditions by biola.edu. 

Our distribution is thus limited to
- build scripts for local replication (for all languages)
- unmodified files redistributable for a particular application
- converted files with the necessary clearance
