# Bavarian Sturmibibl

Note that there is no explicit licensing information on the Sturmibibl, so it is protected.
We thus do not share the data itself, but only the build script.

For creating local TSV or CES/XML versions (`bibl.tsv` and `bibl.xml`) of the Sturmibibl, please run

  $> bash -e ./build.sh

Tested unter Ubuntu 20.4, requires wget, sed, xmllint, perl, w3m, python3.
