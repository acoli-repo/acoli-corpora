For Bibles that we cannot redistribute, we provide build scripts. These are not maintained, however, and many are up to five years old and may require revision.
Note that these do not necessarily produce valid XML, if the source data deviates from the standard pattern.

every sub-directory should provide a language-table.xml file to keep track of convertable languages

`christos-c/` build scripts for retrieving CC0 versions of Bibles from the 100 Bibles corpus. Note that these are not built, but just mirrorred (with full attribution, and used only if not provided independently), as they also use an XML version of Resnik's original DTD.
