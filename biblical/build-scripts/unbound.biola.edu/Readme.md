Unbound Bibles (http://unbound.biola.edu/)
--------------

- retrieval via get-unbound-bibles.sh
- conversion using WorldBible2CES
- metadata post-corrections using prep-for-github.sh

Note that the copyright hasn't been cleared by us, and the files are redistributed unlicensed but under fair use conditions by biola.edu. 

Our distribution is thus limited to
- build scripts for local replication (for all languages)
- unmodified files redistributable for a particular application
- converted files with the necessary clearance

Note that as of June 22, 2022, we've become aware that the portal has been shut down. These scripts are thus defunct, but left here for further reference, in particular, for the case that a mirror of the data may resurface at some point.
