ACoLi parallel biblical text corpus
-----------------------------------

Developed as a parallel corpus for historical and dialectal Germanic languages, we began collecting Bibles, Bible excerpts and related texts for Germanic and other languages.
Unfortunately, most of the material drawn from web sources does not come with an explicit license statement, it is therefore restricted, and even where the copyright of the texts has expired for centuries, the copyright for the electronic edition* may still hold. Therefore, as German law does not support the notion of fair use, we're heavily limited with respect to the data we can redistribute.

* In Germany, this is 25 years after publication. For web resources, the date of publication may be unknown, though, so we have to rely on the date of download.

Wrt. format, we follow the specifications of Philip Resnik's classical Bible corpus (1996, http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/parallel/bible.html), but updated to XML.
Resnik's bibles followed the SGML-based Corpus Encoding Standard (CES). While this has been largely replaced by TEI P5 (http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/), we opted for a minimally invasive update of the format and use an XML version of CES. TEI conversion along the lines of https://github.com/morethanbooks/XML-TEI-Bible may be a topic for future activities.
