00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.950
we tend to be very visual animals.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.479
For most of us, but not all,

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:37.041
our sense of sight is how
we navigate our world.

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.417
For marine mammals that live underwater,

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.304
where chemical cues
and light transmit poorly,

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:48.403
sound is the sense by which they see.

00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:50.741
And sound transmits very well underwater,

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.697
much better than it does in air,

00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.715
so signals can be heard
over great distances.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.361
In the Arctic, this
is especially important,

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:03.298
because not only do Arctic marine
mammals have to hear each other,
