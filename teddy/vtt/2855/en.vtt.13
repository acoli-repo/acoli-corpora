00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.072
that the Arctic can have
very low ambient noise levels.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.464
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:39.855
not only is the Arctic now open
to this wave noise,

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.946
but the number of storms
and the intensity of storms in the Arctic

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.233
has been increasing.

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:50.214
All of this is raising noise levels
in a previously quiet ocean.

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:52.974
Second: water.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.355
With less seasonal sea ice,

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.055
subarctic species are moving north,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:03.631
and taking advantage of the new habitat
that is created by more open water.
