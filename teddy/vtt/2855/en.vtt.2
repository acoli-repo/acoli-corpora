They also use sound by listening
to know something about their environment.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.729
Take, for an example, the Arctic.

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:06.981
It's considered a vast,
inhospitable place,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.586
sometimes described as a desert,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.543
because it is so cold and so remote

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.778
and ice-covered for much of the year.

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:16.981
And despite this,

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:21.049
there is no place on Earth
that I would rather be than the Arctic,

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:24.712
especially as days lengthen
and spring comes.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:29.767
To me, the Arctic really
embodies this disconnect

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:35.047
between what we see on the surface
and what's going on underwater.
