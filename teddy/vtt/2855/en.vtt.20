00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.694
So what can we do now?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.407
We can't decrease wind speeds

00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:08.611
or keep subarctic animals
from migrating north,

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:11.068
but we can work on local solutions

00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:13.887
to reducing human-caused underwater noise.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:17.974
One of these solutions
is to slow down ships

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:19.788
that traverse the Arctic,

00:10:19.812 --> 00:10:23.250
because a slower ship is a quieter ship.

00:10:23.934 --> 00:10:27.726
We can restrict access
in seasons and regions

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.041
that are important for mating
or feeding or migrating.
