00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:03.298
because not only do Arctic marine
mammals have to hear each other,

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:06.433
but they also have to listen
for cues in the environment

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.365
that might indicate
heavy ice ahead or open water.

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:14.261
Remember, although they spend
most of their lives underwater,

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:15.509
they are mammals,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.812
and so they have to surface to breathe.

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:22.314
So they might listen
for thin ice or no ice,

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:25.387
or listen for echoes off nearby ice.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:32.214
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich
and varied underwater soundscape.
