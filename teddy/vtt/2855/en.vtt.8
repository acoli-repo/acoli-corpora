00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:04.114
the underwater Arctic has some
of the lowest ambient noise levels

00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:05.858
of the world's oceans.

00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:07.204
But this is changing.

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:10.892
This is primarily due to a decrease
in seasonal sea ice,

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:15.388
which is a direct result of human
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:19.260
We are, in effect, with climate change,

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:22.958
conducting a completely uncontrolled
experiment with our planet.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.854
Over the past 30 years,

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:29.731
areas of the Arctic have seen
decreases in seasonal sea ice

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:34.170
from anywhere from
six weeks to four months.
