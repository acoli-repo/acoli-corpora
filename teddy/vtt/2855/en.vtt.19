They might impact the environment
in ways that we think we understand,

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:34.629
but also in ways that we don't.

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:41.799
Remember, sound is the most
important sense for these animals.

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:46.398
And not only is the physical habitat
of the Arctic changing rapidly,

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:48.638
but the acoustic habitat is, too.

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:52.803
It's as if we've plucked these animals up
from the quiet countryside

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:56.083
and dropped them into a big city
in the middle of rush hour.

00:09:56.837 --> 00:09:58.441
And they can't escape it.

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.694
So what can we do now?
