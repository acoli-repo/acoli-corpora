00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.987
and see nothing.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.290
But if you could hear underwater,

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.695
the sounds you would hear
would at first amaze

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.806
and then delight you.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.852
And while your eyes are seeing
nothing for kilometers but ice,

00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:01.339
your ears are telling you that out there
are bowhead and beluga whales,
