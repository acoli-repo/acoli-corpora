00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.539
First: air.

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:04.517
Wind on water creates waves.

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:06.366
These waves make bubbles;

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.757
the bubbles break,

00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:09.287
and when they do,

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:10.514
they make noise.

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:14.442
And this noise is like a hiss
or a static in the background.

00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:18.249
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.904
most of the noise from wind
doesn't make it into the water column,

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:26.518
because the ice acts as a buffer
between the atmosphere and the water.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.345
This is one of the reasons

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.072
that the Arctic can have
very low ambient noise levels.
