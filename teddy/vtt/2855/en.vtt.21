00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.041
that are important for mating
or feeding or migrating.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:35.801
We can get smarter about quieting ships

00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:38.577
and find better ways
to explore the ocean bottom.

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:41.670
And the good news is,

00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:44.486
there are people
working on this right now.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.741
But ultimately,

00:10:47.765 --> 00:10:50.632
we humans have to do the hard work

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.812
of reversing or at the very
least decelerating

00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:57.308
human-caused atmospheric changes.

00:10:57.332 --> 00:11:01.791
So, let's return to this idea
of a silent world underwater.
