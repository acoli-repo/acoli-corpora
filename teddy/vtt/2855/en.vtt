In 1956, a documentary
by Jacques Cousteau won

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.842
both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.727
This film was called,
"Le Monde Du Silence,"

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.843
or, "The Silent World."

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:19.777
The premise of the title was that
the underwater world was a quiet world.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.774
We now know, 60 years later,

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.234
that the underwater world
is anything but silent.

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:29.684
Although the sounds
are inaudible above water

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.018
depending on where you are
and the time of year,
