00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:30.968
use instruments called hydrophones,

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:33.037
which are underwater microphones,

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.007
and we record ambient noise --

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:36.955
the noise all around us.

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.320
And the soundscape describes
the different contributors

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:41.861
to this noise field.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:45.344
What we are hearing on our hydrophones

00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:48.903
are the very real sounds
of climate change.

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:52.141
We are hearing these changes
from three fronts:

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:54.603
from the air,

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.080
from the water

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.453
and from land.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.539
First: air.
