and killer whales,

00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.312
further and further north,

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:35.384
and later and later in the season.

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:37.415
We are hearing, in essence,

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:41.172
an invasion of the Arctic
by subarctic species.

00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:43.837
And we don't know what this means.

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:48.528
Will there be competition for food
between Arctic and subarctic animals?

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:54.163
Might these subarctic species introduce
diseases or parasites into the Arctic?

00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:57.812
And what are the new sounds
that they are producing

00:07:57.836 --> 00:08:00.226
doing to the soundscape underwater?
