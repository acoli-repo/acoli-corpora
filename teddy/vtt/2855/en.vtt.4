00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:01.339
your ears are telling you that out there
are bowhead and beluga whales,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:03.639
walrus and bearded seals.

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.570
The ice, too, makes sounds.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:10.078
It screeches and cracks
and pops and groans,

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:15.056
as it collides and rubs when temperature
or currents or winds change.

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.931
And under 100 percent sea ice
in the dead of winter,

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:23.091
bowhead whales are singing.

00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:26.114
And you would never expect that,

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:28.329
because we humans,

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.950
we tend to be very visual animals.
