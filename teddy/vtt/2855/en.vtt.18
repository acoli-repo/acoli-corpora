00:08:57.723 --> 00:09:02.661
And all of these sound sources
are decreasing the acoustic space

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:05.902
over which Arctic marine mammals
can communicate.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:11.298
Now, Arctic marine mammals
are used to very high levels of noise

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:12.803
at certain times of the year.

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:17.403
But this is primarily from other
animals or from sea ice,

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:19.923
and these are the sounds
with which they've evolved,

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:23.437
and these are sounds that are vital
to their very survival.

00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.656
These new sounds
are loud and they're alien.

00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:32.312
They might impact the environment
in ways that we think we understand,
