It has allowed increases in oil
and gas exploration and extraction,

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:35.462
the potential for commercial shipping,

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:37.283
as well as increased tourism.

00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:43.259
And we now know that ship noise increases
levels of stress hormones in whales

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.365
and can disrupt feeding behavior.

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:51.300
Air guns, which produce loud,
low-frequency "whoomps"

00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:53.898
every 10 to 20 seconds,

00:08:53.922 --> 00:08:57.163

And all of these sound sources
are decreasing the acoustic space
