00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.336
You add randomness,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.736
early on in the process,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.256
you make crazy moves,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.655
you try stupid things that shouldn't work,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.696
and that will tend to make
the problem-solving work better.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.256
And the reason for that is

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.336
the trouble with the step-by-step process,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.576
the marginal gains,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.136
is they can walk you
gradually down a dead end.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.376
And if you start with the randomness,
that becomes less likely,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.800
and your problem-solving
becomes more robust.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.120
Let's talk about social psychology.
