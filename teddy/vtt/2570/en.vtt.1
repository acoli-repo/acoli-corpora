00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.976
to host a late-night concert of jazz

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.816
1,400 people were coming.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.416
And in just a few hours,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.856
Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.216
he'd sit down at the piano

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.056
and without rehearsal or sheet music,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.360
he would begin to play.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.536
But right now,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.136
Vera was introducing Keith
to the piano in question,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
and it wasn't going well.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.776
Jarrett looked to the instrument
a little warily,
