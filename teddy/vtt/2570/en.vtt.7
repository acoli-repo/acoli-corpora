It somehow has this peaceful quality,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.936

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.160
it's dynamic.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.439
And the audience loved it.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.216
Audiences continue to love it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.336
because the recording of the Köln Concert

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.856
is the best-selling piano album in history

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.480
and the best-selling
solo jazz album in history.

Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.120
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.
