Late in January 1975,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.816
a 17-year-old German girl
called Vera Brandes

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.480
walked out onto the stage
of the Cologne Opera House.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.320
The auditorium was empty.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.640
It was lit only by the dim, green glow
of the emergency exit sign.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.136
This was the most
exciting day of Vera's life.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.176
She was the youngest
concert promoter in Germany,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.616
and she had persuaded
the Cologne Opera House

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.976
to host a late-night concert of jazz
