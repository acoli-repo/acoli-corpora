00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.536
certain kinds of obstacle,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.322
can actually improve our performance.

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.056
For example,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.816
the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.056
a few years ago,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.136
teamed up with high school teachers.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.896
And he asked them to reformat the handouts

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.280
that they were giving
to some of their classes.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.534
So the regular handout would be formatted
in something straightforward,

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:21.998
such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.856
But half these classes were getting
handouts that were formatted

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.576
in something sort of intense,
like Haettenschweiler,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.616
or something with a zesty bounce,
like Comic Sans italicized.
