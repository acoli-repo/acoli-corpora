00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.336
But let's think for a moment
about Jarrett's initial instinct.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.936
He didn't want to play.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.176
Of course,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.136
I think any of us,
in any remotely similar situation,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.736
would feel the same way,
we'd have the same instinct.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.055
We don't want to be asked
to do good work with bad tools.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.720
We don't want to have to overcome
unnecessary hurdles.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.920
But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.160
and thank goodness he changed his mind.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.640
And I think our instinct is also wrong.
