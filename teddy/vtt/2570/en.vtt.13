If you can, you have
good, strong attentional filters.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.256
But some people really struggle with that.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.016
Some of Carson's undergraduate
subjects struggled with that.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.976
They had weak filters,
they had porous filters --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.376
let a lot of external information in.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.536

constantly being interrupted

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.136

while they were doing their essays,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.656

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.109

but no.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.696
When Carson looked at what
these students had achieved,
