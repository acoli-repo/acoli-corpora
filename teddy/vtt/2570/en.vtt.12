00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.280
to interpret it ...

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.560
and so they learned more.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.520
Another example.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.856
The psychologist Shelley Carson
has been testing Harvard undergraduates

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.856
for the quality
of their attentional filters.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.256
What do I mean by that?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.496
What I mean is,
imagine you're in a restaurant,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.256
you're having a conversation,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.416
there are all kinds of other conversations
going on in the restaurant,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.776
you want to filter them out,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.936
you want to focus
on what's important to you.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.176
Can you do that?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.176
If you can, you have
good, strong attentional filters.
