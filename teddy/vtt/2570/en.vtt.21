00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.336
So when Katherine Phillips
interviewed the groups of four friends,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.216
they had a nice time,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.200
they also thought they'd done a good job.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.920
They were complacent.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.296
When she spoke to the three
friends and the stranger,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.816
they had not had a nice time --

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.440
it's actually rather difficult,
it's rather awkward ...

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720
and they were full of doubt.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.120
They didn't think they'd done a good job
even though they had.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.816
And I think that really exemplifies

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.080
the challenge that we're
dealing with here.
