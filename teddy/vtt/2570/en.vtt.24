he's worked with Coldplay,
he's worked with everybody.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.080
And what does he do to make
these great rock bands better?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.960
Well, he makes a mess.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.656
He disrupts their creative processes.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.776
It's his role to be the awkward stranger.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.216
It's his role to tell them

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.416
that they have to play

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.096

in which he creates this disruption

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.080
is through this remarkable

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.240
I have my signed copy here --
thank you, Brian.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.416
They're called The Oblique Strategies,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.298
he developed them with a friend of his.
