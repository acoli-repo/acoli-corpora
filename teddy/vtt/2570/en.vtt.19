00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.976
In some cases these were four friends,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.560
they all knew each other well.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.936
In other cases,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.880
three friends and a stranger.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.096
And you can see where I'm going with this.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.376
Obviously I'm going to say

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.816
that the groups with the stranger
solved the problem more effectively,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.120
which is true, they did.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.296
Actually, they solved the problem
quite a lot more effectively.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.200
So the groups of four friends,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.096
they only had a 50-50 chance
of getting the answer right.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.816
Which is actually not that great --

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.776
in multiple choice, for three answers?
50-50's not good.
