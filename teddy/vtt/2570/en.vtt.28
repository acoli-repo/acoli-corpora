00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.762
The strategies actually
weren't a deck of cards originally,

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:03.976
they were just a list --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.816
list on the recording studio wall.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.640
A checklist of things
you might try if you got stuck.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.480
The list didn't work.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.360
Know why?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.600
Not messy enough.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.696
Your eye would go down the list

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.776
and it would settle on whatever
was the least disruptive,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.000
the least troublesome,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.360
which of course misses the point entirely.
