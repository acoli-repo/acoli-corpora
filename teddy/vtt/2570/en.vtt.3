00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.776
The black notes were sticking,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.696
the white notes were out of tune,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.376
the pedals didn't work

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.576
and the piano itself was just too small.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.016
It wouldn't create the volume

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.960
that would fill a large space
such as the Cologne Opera House.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.560
So Keith Jarrett left.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240
He went and sat outside in his car,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.976
leaving Vera Brandes

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.640
to get on the phone
to try to find a replacement piano.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.296
Now she got a piano tuner,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.920
but she couldn't get a new piano.
