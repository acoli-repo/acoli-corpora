00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.080
the challenge that we're
dealing with here.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.496
Because, yeah --

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.376
the ugly font,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.176
the awkward stranger,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.520
the random move ...

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.656
these disruptions help us solve problems,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.016
they help us become more creative.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.096
But we don't feel that they're helping us.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.160
We feel that they're
getting in the way ...

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.240
and so we resist.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.440
And that's why the last example
is really important.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.576
So I want to talk about somebody

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.536
from the background
of the world of rock 'n' roll.
