00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've been fascinated for a lifetime

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by the beauty, form and function

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of giant bluefin tuna.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're the largest of the tunas,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They actually are a fish

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is endothermic --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design
