Actually, I come from Britain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, that's home really.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
off the southwest coast of India here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Capital, Malé, where I live.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000

If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And it has been my home these years.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,
