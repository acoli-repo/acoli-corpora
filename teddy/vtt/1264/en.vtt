00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:02.785
We see with the eyes,

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.254
but we see with the brain as well.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.839
And seeing with the brain
is often called imagination.

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:15.165
And we are familiar with the landscapes
of our own imagination,

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.559
our inscapes.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.583
We've lived with them all our lives.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.799
But there are also hallucinations as well.

00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:25.976
And hallucinations
are completely different.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.110
They don't seem to be of our creation.

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:30.174
They don't seem to be under control.
