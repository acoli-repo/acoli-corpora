00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:31.780
Now, one thing I must 
point out straightaway

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.657
is that not all plants

00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:37.573
can be developed in vitro.

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:41.396
While we humans, we are 
happy in our comfort zone,

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.632
these plants also need

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:46.366
their ecosystem to be preserved,

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.199
and they don't react — endemic plants

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.518
don't react to very harsh 
changes in their ecosystem,

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.779
and yet we know what are the challenges

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.867
that climate change, for example,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:56.910
is posing to these plants.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.438
Now, the local people again use the leaves

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:01.192
in traditional medicine
