00:12:28.186 --> 00:12:30.817
So let's take a look at this plant here,

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:33.300
Centella asiatica. It's a weed.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.448

00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:38.324

in Africa, in Asia — 
the best quality Centella

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:59.503

00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:03.688
because that Centella contains
the three vital ingredients
