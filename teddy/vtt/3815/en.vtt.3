and protects it and of course 
ensures its survival.

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.661
Now the question you're 
probably asking yourself is,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.562
why is she telling us all these stories?

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:41.248
The reason for that is that we tend to overlook

00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:45.632
the diversity and the variety of the natural world.

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:48.525
These particular habitats are unique

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.753
and they are host to a whole lot of plants.

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:54.924
We don't realize how valuable

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.534
and how precious these resources are,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.729
and yet, through our insouciance,

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.898
we keep on destroying them.
