00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:01.131
And if you look at the trunk,

00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:04.734
the trunk, of course, safeguards water,

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:07.535
which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:09.213
and the leaves are used in traditional medicine

00:09:09.213 --> 00:09:11.168
against infectious disease.

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.744
Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it

00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:15.544
to be the tree of life.

00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:17.209
It's a complete plant,

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:19.751
and in fact, the sheer size of these trees

00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:21.854
is hiding a massive potential,

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:25.296
not only for the pharma, nutrition,
and the cosmetic industry.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:27.302
What I have showed you here

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:29.532
is only the species from Africa,

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.416
Adansonia digitata.
