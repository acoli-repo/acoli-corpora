00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:30.492
as to how our health

00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:33.996
and our survival are closely linked

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:36.808
to the health and the resilience

00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:38.653
of our ecosystem,

00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:40.587
and why we should be very careful

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:43.288
about preserving biodiversity.

00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:46.490
Every time a forest is cut down,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.110
every time a marsh is filled in,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.860
it is a potential lab that goes with it,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.168
and which we will never, ever recover.

00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:57.735
And I know what I'm talking about,

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:01.067
coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.
