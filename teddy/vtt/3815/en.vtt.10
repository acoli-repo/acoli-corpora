00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.630
in its natural habitat.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.778
This brings me to another example.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:07.568
This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate

00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:09.290
in the local vernacular.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.945
The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.836
It's a plant which is rare,

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.548
which is endemic to Mauritius.

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:17.770
It used to grow on the mainland,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.213
but through the sheer 
pressures of urbanization

00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:22.492
has been pushed out of the mainland,

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:24.193
and we've managed to bring it back

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:25.669
from the brink of extinction

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.736
by developing in vitro plants

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:29.584
which are now growing in the wild.

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:31.780
Now, one thing I must 
point out straightaway
