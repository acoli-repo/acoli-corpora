00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.964
that we should be studying very carefully,

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:07.254
because human societies over the millennia,

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.302
they have developed important knowledge,

00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:12.120
cultural traditions,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.416
and important plant-based medicinal resources.

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.401
Here's a data point:

00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.563
1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:26.467
is home to 40 percent of
the species of higher plants,

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.155
35 percent of the species of vertebrates,

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.698
and this 1.4 percent
