00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:31.517
in West Africa, it's known 
as the palaver tree,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.587
because it performs great social functions.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:36.806
Now if you have a problem in the community,

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.544
meeting under the palaver tree

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.523
with the chiefs or the tribesmen

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.685
would be synonymous to trying to find a solution

00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:44.130
to that particular problem,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.070
and also to reinforce trust and respect

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.591
among members of the community.

From the scientific point of view,

00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:54.682
there are eight species of baobab in the world.

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.664
There's one from Africa,

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.333
one from Australia,

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.080
and six are endemic
