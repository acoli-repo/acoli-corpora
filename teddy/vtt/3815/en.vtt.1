00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.372
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:37.298
and the botanical name 
is Terminalia bentzoe,

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:39.199
subspecies bentzoe.

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.507
This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:44.318
and its particular feature

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.792
is its heterophylly.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.918
What do I mean by heterophylly?

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:50.481
It's that the same plant

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.564
has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:55.149
Now, these plants have evolved

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.503
very far away from the mainland,

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:00.901
and within specific ecosystems.
