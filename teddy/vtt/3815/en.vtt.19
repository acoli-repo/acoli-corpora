00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.416
Adansonia digitata.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.080
We have six species yet in Madagascar,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.564
and we don't know what

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.592
is considered to be

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.477
Now here you'll find

00:09:51.477 --> 00:09:53.395

00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:54.998
(Laughter)

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:57.991
Now, this plant here has developed

00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.970
remarkable tolerance to drought,
