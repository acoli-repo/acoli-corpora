00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.129
that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.351
against a wide range of bacteria

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:37.427
that could be pathogenic to humans.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.868
Now, could this plant be the answer

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:42.489
to antibiotic resistance?

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.840
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.560
a big challenge globally.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.363
While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.972
we will not want this plant to disappear.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.616
But the harsh reality is that

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.600
this particular plant is in fact

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.470
considered to be vulnerable

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.630
in its natural habitat.
