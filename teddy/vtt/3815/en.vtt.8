00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.343
on the island for their 
biomedical applications.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.680
Now, let's go back again

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.520
to that first plant I showed you,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.547
the one, of course, with 
different-shaped leaves

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.403
and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,

00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:11.070
subspecies bentzoe,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.665
a plant only found in Mauritius.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.110
Now, the local people,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.336
they used a decoction of the leaves

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:19.867
against infectious diseases.

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.319
Now our work, that is,

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.728
the scientific validation of 
this traditional information,

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:27.800
has shown that precisely

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.129
that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,
