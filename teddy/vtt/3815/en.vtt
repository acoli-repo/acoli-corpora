00:00:00.907 --> 00:00:03.335
You know, it's a big privilege for me

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.227
to be working in one of the
biodiversity hotspots in the world:

00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:09.928
the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:13.673
These islands — Mauritius,
Rodrigues, and Réunion —

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:16.811
along with the island of Madagascar,

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:18.727
they are blessed with unique plants

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.840
found nowhere else in the world.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.529
And today I will tell you 
about five of them

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.524
and their particular features

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.408
and why these plants are so unique.

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:29.968
Take a look at this plant.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.372
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,
