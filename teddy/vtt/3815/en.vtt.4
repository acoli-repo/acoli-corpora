00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.898
we keep on destroying them.

00:02:01.898 --> 00:02:03.630
We're all familiar

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.825
with the macro impact of urbanization,

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:10.267
climate change, resource exploitation,

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:12.440
but when that one last plant —

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.649
or animal for that matter —

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.848
when that very last specimen

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:18.959
has disappeared from the face of this Earth,

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.355
we would have lost

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:24.261
an entire subset of the Earth's biology,

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:27.939
and with it, important plants 
with medicinal potential

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.874
or which could have ingredients

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:31.395
that would speak to the cosmetic,
