00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:31.395
that would speak to the cosmetic,

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.316
nutrition, pharma,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.735
and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.478
be gone forever.

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:39.413
And here we have a very prime example

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:42.158
of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:46.545
and, of course, we know is 
now a symbol of extinction.

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.165
We know plants have a 
fundamental role to play.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:51.000
Well, first of all, they feed us

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.890
and they also give us 
the oxygen we breathe,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.207
but plants are also the source

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:59.762
of important, biologically active ingredients

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.964
that we should be studying very carefully,
