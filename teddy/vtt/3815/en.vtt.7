00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.698
and this 1.4 percent

00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:36.366
represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:39.524
and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:42.406
already provides for 35 percent

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:44.240
of the ecosystem services

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.918
that vulnerable people depend on.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:48.266
And as you can see,

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:49.679
the island of Mauritius

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.762
where I work and where I live,

00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:54.467
belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.681
and I study the unique plants

00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.343
on the island for their 
biomedical applications.
