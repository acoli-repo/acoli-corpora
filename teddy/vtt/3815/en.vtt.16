00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.080
and six are endemic

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.727
to the island of Madagascar.

00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:04.359
The one I have showed you

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.949
is the one from Africa,

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:07.870
Adansonia digitata.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.190
Now, the flower, this 
beautiful white flower,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.314
it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,

00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:14.913
and it gives rise to the fruit

00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:16.465
which is curiously known

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:18.200
as the monkey apple.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.693
The monkeys are not stupid animals.

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:21.426
They know what's good for them.

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:24.227
Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,

00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:26.820
you'll see a white, floury pulp,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.917
which is very rich in nutrients

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.291
and has got protein,
