00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:00.901
and within specific ecosystems.

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.725
Often, these particular features

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.536
have evolved as a response to the threat

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:08.973
presented by the local fauna,

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:12.593
in this case, grazing tortoises.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.749
Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.235
and as such, they tend to avoid the plants

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:20.294
they don't recognize.

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:23.668
So this evolutionary 
foil safeguards the plant

00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:26.593
against these rather cute animals,

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:31.651
and protects it and of course 
ensures its survival.
