And I shoved a menu down my pants.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.796
(Laughter)

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.526
I just wanted some keepsakes
so that when I got home,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.835
I could believe it had really
happened to me.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.470
You know?

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.131
The three writers I wanted to meet

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:47.964
were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman
and Peggy Phelan.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.550
These were not famous,
best-selling authors,

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.881
but to me, they were women-writer titans.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.262
Carole Maso wrote the book
that later became my art bible.
