00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.132
So I'm on the right stage.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.770
(Laughter)

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:40.237
But the real reason,
I think, I was a misfit,

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.523
is that my daughter died
the day she was born,

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.666
and I hadn't figured out
how to live with that story yet.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.360
After my daughter died
I also spent a long time homeless,

00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:55.328
living under an overpass

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:59.570
in a kind of profound state
of zombie grief and loss

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:02.108
that some of us encounter along the way.
