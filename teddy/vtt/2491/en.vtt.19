00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:30.313
Instead, I flew back to Oregon,

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:36.029
and as I watched the evergreens
and rain come back into view,

00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:40.345
I just drank many tiny bottles
of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.333
I thought about how, if I was a writer,
I was some kind of misfit writer.

00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:48.403
What I'm saying is,

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:50.431
I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:51.606
without an agent,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.115
and with only a headful
and heart-ful of memories

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.287
of having sat so near

00:09:57.311 --> 00:09:59.581
the beautiful writers.
