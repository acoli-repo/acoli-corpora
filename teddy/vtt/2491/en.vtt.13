00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.866
The whole time he was talking to me,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.595
I sat there smiling and nodding
like a numb idiot,

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.361
with my arms crossed over my chest,

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:42.302
while nothing, nothing, nothing
came out of my throat.

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.242
So in the end, he patted me
on the shoulder

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.847
like a swim coach might.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.415
And he wished me luck

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.877
and he gave me some free books

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.692
and he showed me out the door.

00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:00.855
Next, they took me
to the offices of W.W. Norton,
