00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:04.572
So I know TED is about a lot
of things that are big,

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:08.126
but I want to talk to you
about something very small.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.308
So small, it's a single word.

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:12.649
The word is "misfit."

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.966
It's one of my favorite words,
because it's so literal.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:21.349
I mean, it's a person
who sort of missed fitting in.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.048
Or a person who fits in badly.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.581
Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.473
to new situations and environments."
