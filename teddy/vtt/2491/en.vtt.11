00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.082
It nearly killed me with joy

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:34.947
to hang out with these three
over-50-year-old women writers.

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:37.897
And the reason it nearly
killed me with joy

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.990
is that I'd never known a joy like that.

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:41.696
I'd never been in a room like that.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.108
My mother never went to college.

00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:47.236
And my creative career to that point

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.712
was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.673
So kind of in those first nights
in New York I wanted to die there.

00:05:56.697 --> 00:06:00.137
I was just like, "Kill me now.
I'm good. This is beautiful."
