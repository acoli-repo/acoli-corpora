00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.350
functional or useless.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.215
So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:05.535
sustainable products.

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:07.831
Let's take the LED.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.245
The LED is the next best thing to daylight.

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.426
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.934
I'm not going to ask for a show of hands

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:18.223
of how many of you still have them in your homes,

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:21.045
wasting energy every time you switch them on --

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:22.482
change them after this --

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:26.175
or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:29.966
but those old incandescent light bulbs

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.988
really should have been sold as heaters.
