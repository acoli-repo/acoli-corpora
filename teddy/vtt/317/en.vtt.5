00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.661
called "people and planet positive"

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.308
to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:36.443
Why would we not want to have a positive impact

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:39.031
on the world as a business?

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.519
Other companies have sustainability strategies.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.357
I'm going to refer to some of those as well,

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:44.894
and I'm just going to mention a few

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:47.490
of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.506
But first, let's think of customers.

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:53.331
We know from asking people from China to the U.S.

00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:56.659
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.541
after the day-to-day issues,

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.118
the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?
