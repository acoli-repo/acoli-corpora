00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:31.671
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy

00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.691
than the energy we consume as a business.

00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.667
For all of our stores, our own factories,

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.045
our distribution centers,

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.499
we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:42.873
and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate

00:08:42.873 --> 00:08:45.500
in six countries, and we're not done yet.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.284
But think of a solar panel.

00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:49.463
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.956
The electricity is free.

00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:52.761
Every time the sun comes out after that,

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.196
the electricity is free.

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:56.213
So this is a good thing for the CFO,

00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.156
not just the sustainability guy.

00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:01.190
Every business can do things like this.
