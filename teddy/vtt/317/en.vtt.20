00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:01.118
to support a better quality of life

00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:02.706
and protect child rights?

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:05.003
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:07.478
on developing some new business principles

00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:08.943
with children's rights.

00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:10.760
Increasing numbers of businesses

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.280
are signing up to these,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.743
but actually in a survey, many business leaders

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:17.610
said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.109
So what we decided to do was, we will look

00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:22.670
and ask ourselves the tough questions

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.734
with partners who know more than us,

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:27.691
what can we do to go beyond our business

00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:29.533
to help improve the lives of children?

00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:31.352
We also have a foundation
