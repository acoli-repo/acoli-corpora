00:10:59.343 --> 00:11:02.321
were led equally by men and women?

00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:05.304
(Applause)

00:11:05.304 --> 00:11:10.446
So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA

00:11:10.446 --> 00:11:13.410
that 47 percent are women today,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.806
but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:18.093
and follow it all the way through to senior management.

00:11:18.093 --> 00:11:20.939
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:23.898
So we've launched a women's open network

00:11:23.898 --> 00:11:25.423
this week in IKEA,

00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:27.599
and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:29.014
So the message here is,

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.398
measure what you care about and lead the change,
