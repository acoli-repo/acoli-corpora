00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.118
the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.097
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:06.559
Then they care about big issues like climate change.

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.991
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.983
and they expect business to help,

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:15.777
and they're a little bit disappointed today.

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:18.411
So take your mind back and think

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:19.998
of the first sustainable products.

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:23.911
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.965
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:28.812
that took five minutes to warm up

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.883
and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.
