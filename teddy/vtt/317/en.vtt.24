00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.977
But also, there are other businesses already acting.

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.122
I mentioned renewable energy.

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:06.440
You go to Google or Lego,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.700
they're going 100 percent renewable too,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.067
in the same way that we are.

00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:13.193
On having really good sustainability strategies,

00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:16.437
there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:18.591
Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.

00:12:18.591 --> 00:12:20.749
But I don't think any of those businesses would say

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:23.014
they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:25.380
We'll make mistakes going forward,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.897
but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,

00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:29.586
having a dialogue with the right partners,

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:34.102
and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.
