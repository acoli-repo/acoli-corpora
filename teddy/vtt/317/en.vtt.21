WEBVTT

00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:31.352
We also have a foundation

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:33.247
that's committed to work through partners

00:10:33.247 --> 00:10:35.870
and help improve the lives and protect the rights

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.737
of 100 million children by 2015.

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:40.413
You know the phrase,

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:43.791
you can manage what you measure?

00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:48.441
Well, you should measure what you care about.

00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:49.990
If you're not measuring things,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.734
you don't care and you don't know.

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:54.903
So let's take an example, measure the things

00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:57.060
that are important in your business.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.343
Isn't it about time that businesses

00:10:59.343 --> 00:11:02.321
were led equally by men and women?
