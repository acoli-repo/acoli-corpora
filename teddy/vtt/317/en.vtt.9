00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.988
really should have been sold as heaters.

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.965
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.407
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:39.479
Now we have lights that produce light

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.171
and a little bit of heat on the side.

You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:46.040
that you would have done in an old incandescent.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.775
And the best thing is, they'll also last

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:49.354
for more than 20 years.

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:50.610
So think about that.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.106
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.182
probably more if you're in this audience.

00:04:55.182 --> 00:04:57.792
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.344
Your kids could go to school, go to college,
