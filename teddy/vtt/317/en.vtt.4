00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.380
So think about it.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.150
We're building cities like never before,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.676
bringing people out of poverty like never before,

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.051
and changing the climate like never before.

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.111
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:13.776
to a must-do.

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:16.609
it's about what we do right here, right now,

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.290
and for the rest of our working lives.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.322
So I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:23.695
what business can do

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.997
and what a business like IKEA can do,

00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:28.664
and we have a sustainability strategy

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.661
called "people and planet positive"
