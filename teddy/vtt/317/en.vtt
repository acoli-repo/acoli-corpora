00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:03.047
I've spent my life working on sustainability.

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:05.102
I set up a climate change NGO

00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:06.422
called The Climate Group.

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:09.813
I worked on forestry issues in WWF.

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.889
I worked on development and agriculture issues

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.624
in the U.N. system.

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:15.548
About 25 years in total,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.271
and then three years ago, I found myself talking to

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.556
IKEA's CEO about joining his team.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.582
Like many people here, well,

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:27.517
I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.203
so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.
