00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:00.151
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.593
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:05.383
Let's take cotton.

00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:07.112
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people

00:06:07.112 --> 00:06:08.523
are wearing cotton right now.

00:06:08.523 --> 00:06:10.057
It's a brilliant textile in use.

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:11.624
It's really dirty in production.

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:15.758
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.378
So we've worked with others,

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:18.980
with other businesses and NGOs,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.836
on the Better Cotton Initiative,

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.005
working right back down to the farm,

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:24.840
and there you can halve the amount of water

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.671
and halve the chemical inputs,

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:29.567
the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.236
of running many of these farms
