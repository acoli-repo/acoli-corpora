00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.310
what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.361
We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.709
or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.398
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:10.241
we've been having the last few years,

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.823
much of that is due to just one degree warming,

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.118
and we need CO2 emissions to peak

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:17.350
by the end of this decade globally

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.078
and then come down.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:23.149
It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.910
The third number is 12:

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.403
That's the number of cities in the world

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.194
that had a million or more people

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:29.627
when my grandmother was born.

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:31.247
You can see my grandmother there.
