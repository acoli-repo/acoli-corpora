and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:35.251
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.983
So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:40.089
or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.758
or sometimes all three together,

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.203
you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:48.101
It wasn't a great start.

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.389
Today we have choices.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.686
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:58.487
sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.350
functional or useless.
