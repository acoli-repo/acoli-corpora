00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:30.703
because then you stop investing in the old stuff,

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:32.857
you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:35.186
you use your supply chain and your creativity

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:37.943
and you get the prices down so everybody can afford

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:40.894
the best lights so they can save energy.

00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:45.044
(Applause)

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.173
It's not just about products in people's homes.

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:49.817
We've got to think about the raw materials

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.999
that produce our products.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:53.826
Obviously there's fantastic opportunities

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.320
with recycled materials,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.163
and we can and will go zero waste.

00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:00.151
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.
