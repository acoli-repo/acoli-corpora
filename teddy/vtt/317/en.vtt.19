00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:31.098
So a code of conduct was developed,

00:09:31.098 --> 00:09:34.049
and now we have 80 auditors out in the world

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:36.080
every day making sure all our factories

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.364
secure good working conditions

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:39.913
and protect human rights

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.174
and make sure there is no child labor.

00:09:42.174 --> 00:09:44.334
But it's not just as simple as making sure

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.366
there's no child labor.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:48.566
You've got to say that's not enough today.

00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:50.614
I think we'd all agree that children

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:52.810
are the most important people in the world

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.707
and the most vulnerable.

00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:56.955
So what can a business do today

00:09:56.955 --> 00:09:58.839
to actually use your total value chain

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:01.118
to support a better quality of life
