00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.203
so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:35.010
But first, let's just take three numbers.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.081
The first number is three:

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.641
three billion people.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.452
This is the number of people joining

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:42.504
the global middle class by 2030,

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:43.813
coming out of poverty.

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:46.054
It's fantastic for them and their families,

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:49.097
but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,

00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:51.394
and this swells that number to five,

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:54.724
a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:56.601
The second number is six:

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.746
This is six degrees centigrade,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.310
what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.
