You can see my grandmother there.

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:33.290
That was in the beginning of the last century.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.306
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.327
the ninth largest city in the world.

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:40.032
Now there are 500 cities, nearly,

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.463
with a million people or more in them.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:45.807
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:49.551
that's the century when we build all the world's cities,

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.961
the century that we're in the middle of right now.

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.807
Every other century was kind of practice,

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:59.625
and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.380
So think about it.
