Every business can do things like this.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.169
But then we've got to look beyond our operations,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.918
and I think everybody would agree

00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:08.290
that now business has to take full responsibility

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.494
for the impacts of your supply chain.

00:09:10.494 --> 00:09:12.810
Many businesses now, fortunately,

We found there was a risk

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:23.120
of child labor in the supply chain,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.630
and people in the business were shocked.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.954
And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.

00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:31.098
So a code of conduct was developed,
