00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How will we be remembered in 200 years?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It happened 225 years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,
