Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In fact, mostly now in other things.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
groupings that go back a long time,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
longer than the familiar families.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
