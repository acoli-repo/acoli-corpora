So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You may just know more about everything than anyone.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.
