00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
