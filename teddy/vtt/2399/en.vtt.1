They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and I would love to see where that leads.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Does it really lead to a single ancestor

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
some 20, 25,000 years ago?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?
