00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.976
more stories with women
40 years of age or older on-screen,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.896
which I think is good news for this crowd.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.856
More underrepresented --

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.216
(Laughter)

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.456
Sorry.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.256
(Laughter)

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.536
Sorry but not sorry.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.216
More underrepresented characters
in terms of race and ethnicity,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.536
and most importantly,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.936
more women working behind the camera

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.056
in key production roles.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.816
Easy answer to the problems
that we just talked about.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.056
Or is it?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.856
It's actually not.
