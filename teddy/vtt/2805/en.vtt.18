00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.360
and the entertainment industry
does not trust us as an audience.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.616
Well, I told you
there would be a silver lining,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.840
and there is.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.976
There are actually
simple and tangible solutions

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.536
to fixing this problem

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.176
that involve content creators,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.416
executives and consumers

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.776
like the individuals in this room.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.696
Let's talk about a few of them.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.176
The first is what I call "just add five."

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.256
Did you know if we looked
at the top 100 films next year

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.496
and simply added five female
speaking characters on-screen

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.936
to each of those films,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.576
it would create a new norm.
