00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.576
it would create a new norm.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.376
If we were to do this
for three contiguous years,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.416
we would be at gender parity

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.000
for the first time
in over a half of a century.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.896
Now, this approach is advantageous
for a variety of reasons.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.856
One? It doesn't take away jobs
for male actors.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.216
Heaven forbid.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.656
(Laughter)

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.616
Two, it's actually cost-effective.
It doesn't cost that much.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.536
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.176
And four, it humanizes
the production process.
