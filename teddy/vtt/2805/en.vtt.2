00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.416
females are still erased and marginalized

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.496
in a lot of our stories.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.376
And I learned this for the first time
about 10 years ago

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.176
when I did my first study
on gender role in G-rated films.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.776
Since then, we've conducted
more than 30 investigations.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.656
My team is tired.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.056
And I've committed my life

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.576
as researcher and activist

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.296
to fighting the inclusion crisis

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.176
in Hollywood.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.696
So today, what I'd like to do
is tell you about that crisis.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.296
I want to talk about
gender inequality in film.
