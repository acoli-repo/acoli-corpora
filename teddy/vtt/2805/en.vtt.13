00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.856
It's actually not.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.136
800 films, 2007-2015,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.736
886 directors.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.376
Only 4.1 percent are women.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.296
Only three are African-American or black,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.800
and only one woman was Asian.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.016
So why is it so difficult

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.816
to have female directors

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.496
if they're part of the solution?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.296
Well, to answer this question,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.520
we conducted a study.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.416
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.856
and asked them about directors.
