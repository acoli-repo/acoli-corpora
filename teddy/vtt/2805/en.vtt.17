00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.216
Our own economic analyses show
that gender of the lead character

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.736
doesn't play a role in economic success
in the United States.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.056
But what does?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.936
Production costs alone

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.560
or in conjunction with how widely
a film is distributed in this country.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.480
It's not the gender of the lead character.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.336
So at this point, we should
all be sufficiently depressed.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.896
No change in 50 years,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.296
few female directors
working behind the camera

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.360
and the entertainment industry
does not trust us as an audience.
