00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.856
about whether females can open a film.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.736
Open a film means that if you
place a female at the center,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.696
it doesn't have the return on investment

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.680

at the center of a story does.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.096
This misperception is actually costly.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.776
like "The Hunger Games,"

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.016
"Pitch Perfect"

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.720
or that small little indie film,
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens."

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.216
Our own economic analyses show
that gender of the lead character
