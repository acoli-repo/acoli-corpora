Now, in the NFL,
the Rooney Rule stipulates

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.136
that if a team wants to hire a coach
from outside the organization,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.096
what they have to do is interview
an underrepresented candidate.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.216
The exact same principle
can apply to Hollywood films.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.456
How?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.936
Well, on these top films,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.416
executives and agents can make sure

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.656
that women and people of color
are not only on the consideration list,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.056
but they're actually
interviewed for the job.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.576
Now, one might say,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.016
why is this important?
