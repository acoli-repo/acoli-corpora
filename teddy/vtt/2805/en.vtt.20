And four, it humanizes
the production process.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.960
Why? Because it makes sure
that there's women on set.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160
Second solution is for A-list talent.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.376
A-listers, as we all know,
can make demands in their contracts,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.096
particularly the ones that work
on the biggest Hollywood films.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.856
What if those A-listers

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.976
simply added an equity clause
or an inclusion rider

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.056
into their contract?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.016
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.736
Well, you probably don't know

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.096
but the typical feature film

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.800
has about 40 to 45
speaking characters in it.
