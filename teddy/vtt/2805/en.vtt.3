00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.296
I want to talk about
gender inequality in film.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.696
I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.736
and then I'm going to tell you
how we're going to fix it.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.576
However, one caveat before I begin:

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.936
my data are really depressing.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.016
So I want to apologize in advance,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.176
because I'm going to put you all
in a really bad mood.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.576
But I'm going to bring it up at the end,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.456
and I'm going to present a silver lining

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.856
to fix this mess that we've been in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.456
for a very, very long time.
