00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.456
for a very, very long time.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.416
So, let's start with the gravity
of the situation.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.056
Each year, my research team
examines the top 100 grossing films

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.696
in the United States.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.936
What we do is we look at every speaking
or named character on-screen.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.896

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.176
(Laughter)

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.616
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.656
from 2007 to 2015,
