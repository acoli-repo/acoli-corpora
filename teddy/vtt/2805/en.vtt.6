00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.256
There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.709
and if you compare our results

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:07.376
to a small sample of films
from 1946 to 1955,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.696
there's been no change
in over a half of a century.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.096
Over half of a century!

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.736
But we're half of the population.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.576
Now, if we look at this data
intersectionally,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.736
which has been a focus of today,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.856
the picture becomes even more problematic.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.896
Across the top 100 films
of just last year,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.216
48 films didn't feature one black
or African-American speaking character,
