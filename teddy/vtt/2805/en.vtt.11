So, as soon as I recognized
these patterns,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.136
I wanted to find out why,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.056
and it turns out that there are
two drivers to inequality on-screen:

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.176
content creator gender
and misperceptions of the audience.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.936
Let's unpack them really quick.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.896
If you want to change
any of the patterns I just talked about,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.376

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.416
Turns out, the female directors

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.936
are associated with,
in terms of short films and indie films,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.776
more girls and women on-screen,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.416
more stories with women in the center,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.976
more stories with women
40 years of age or older on-screen,
