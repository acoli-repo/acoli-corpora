00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.296
The perception of director or a leader

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.976
is inconsistent
with the perception of a woman.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.016
The roles are incongruous,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.176
which is consistent with a lot of research
in the psychological arena.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.336
Second factor contributing
to inequality on-screen

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.936
is misperceptions of the audience.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.616
I don't need to tell this crowd:

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.896
50 percent of the people
that go to the box office and buy tickets

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.896
are girls and women in this country.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.136
Right?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.496
But we're not perceived to be a viable
or financially lucrative target audience.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.736
Further, there's some misperceptions
