WEBVTT

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.800
has about 40 to 45
speaking characters in it.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.936
I would argue that only 8 to 10
of those characters

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.976
are actually relevant to the story.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.016
Except maybe "Avengers." Right?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.720
A few more in "Avengers."

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.056
The remaining 30 or so roles,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.496
there's no reason why those minor roles

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.416
can't match or reflect the demography

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.640
of where the story is taking place.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.696
An equity rider by an A-lister
in their contract

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.136
can stipulate that those roles
