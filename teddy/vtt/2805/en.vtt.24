00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.016
why is this important?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.256
Because it exposes or introduces
executives to female directors

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.720
who otherwise fall prey
to exclusionary hiring practices.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.896
The fourth solution

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.160
is for consumers like me and you.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.256
If we want to see more films
by, for and about women,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.960
we have to support them.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.976
It may mean going
to the independent theater chain

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.936
instead of the multiplex.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.456
Or it might mean scrolling down
a little further online

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.056
to find a film by a female director.
