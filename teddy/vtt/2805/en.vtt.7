00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.216
48 films didn't feature one black
or African-American speaking character,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.496
not one.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.736
70 films were devoid of Asian
or Asian-American speaking characters

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.176
that were girls or women.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.816
None.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.216
Eighty-four films didn't feature one
female character that had a disability.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.816
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual
or transgender female speaking characters.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.016
This is not underrepresentation.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.936
This is erasure,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.776
and I call this
the epidemic of invisibility.
