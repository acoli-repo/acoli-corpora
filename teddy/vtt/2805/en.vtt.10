00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.736
or any other internal organ.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.776
(Laughter)

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.376
Now, all joking aside,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.336
theories suggest, research confirms,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.736
exposure to thin ideals
and objectifying content

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.576
can lead to body dissatisfaction,
internalization of the thin ideal

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.016
and self-objectification
among some female viewers.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.016
Obviously, what we see on-screen

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.016
and what we see in the world,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.776
they do not match.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.056
They do not match!

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.336
Matter of fact,
if we lived in the screen world,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.960
we would have a population
crisis on our hands.
