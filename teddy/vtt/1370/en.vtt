00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.936
I started Improv Everywhere
about 10 years ago

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.456
when I moved to New York City
with an interest in acting and comedy.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.456
Because I was new to the city,
I didn't have access to a stage,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.856
so I decided to create
my own in public places.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.256
So the first project
we're going to take a look at

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.176
is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.176
Now, this took place in January of 2002.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.136
And this woman is the star of the video.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.896
She doesn't know she's being filmed.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.856
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.816
This is on the 6 train in New York City.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.936
And this is the first stop along the line.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.216
These are two Danish guys
