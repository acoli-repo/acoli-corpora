I'm almost like a crazy evangelical.

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:05.331
I've always known that the age of design is upon us,

00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:07.412
almost like a rapture.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.947
If the day is sunny, I think,

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:11.472
"Oh, the gods have had a good design day."

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:15.788
Or, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:17.090
particularly beautiful, I say

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.090
he's so good because he clearly looked to design

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.813
to understand what he needed to do.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.514
So I really do believe that design

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:27.276
is the highest form of creative expression.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.986
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,
