00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.348
Later measurements of individual galaxies

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.096
confirmed this puzzling result.

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.183
There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:36.769
to provide enough gravity to hold them together.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:37.770
From what we can see,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.855
they ought to fly apart, but they don't.

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:40.980
So there must be stuff there

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.399
that we can't see.

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.578
We call that stuff dark matter.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.563
The best evidence for dark matter today

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:47.822
comes from measurements of something

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:49.573
called the cosmic microwave background,

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.074
the afterglow of the Big Bang,

00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:52.450
but that's another story.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.707
All of the evidence we have

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.286
says that dark matter is there

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:56.873
and it accounts for much of the stuff

00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:58.665
in those beautiful spiral galaxies

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.191
that fill the heavens.
