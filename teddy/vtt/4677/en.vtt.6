00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.191
that fill the heavens.

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.989
So where does that leave us?

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.605
We've long known that the heavens

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.261
do not revolve around us

00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.793
and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet,

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:09.485
orbiting a fairly ordinary star,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:12.135
in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy.

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:14.030
The discovery of dark matter took us

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.977
one step further away from the center of things.

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.478
It told us that the stuff we're made of

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.688
is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe.

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:22.998
But there was more to come.

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:23.898
Early this century,

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.234
scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:28.778
confirmed that not only is everything moving apart

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:30.196
from everything else,
