00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.841
Not bad for a day's work.

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.094
Dark energy would probably be harder to understand,

00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.964
but there are some speculative theories out there

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:36.263
that might point the way.

00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:37.374
Among them are theories that go back

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:39.916
to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks,

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:42.421
the idea that we began with several minutes ago,

00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.120
the idea that the universe must be simple.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.139
These theories predict that there is just a single element

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.933
from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems,

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:51.595
a vibrating string.

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:53.764
The idea is that all the particles we know today

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:56.183
are just different harmonics on the string.

00:04:56.183 --> 00:04:57.999
Unfortunately, string theories today

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.556
are, as yet, untestable.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.772
But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored,
