00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:01.080
with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.530
Everything we see is made up

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.870
of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.958
This theory is simple and elegant,

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.037
and it has the advantage

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:11.423
over the earth, air, fire, and water theory

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:12.598
of being right.

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:15.238
Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.002
have established that the real elements,

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.354
things like hydrogen,

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:18.878
carbon,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:19.741
and iron,

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.661
can be broken down into atoms.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.078
In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest,

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:26.938
indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:27.720
as hydrogen,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.252
carbon,

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:29.049
or iron.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.923
The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea
