00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.925
It looks as if dark energy makes up

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:02.761
about 68% of the universe

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:05.238
and dark matter about 27%,

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:07.097
leaving just 5% for us

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.599
and everything else we can actually see.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.209
So what's the dark stuff made of?

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.851
We don't know,

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.755
but there's one theory, called &lt;i&gt;supersymmetry&lt;/i&gt;,

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:15.605
that could explain some of it.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.262
Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short,

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:19.997
predicts a whole range of new particles,

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:21.957
some of which could make up the dark matter.

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.785
If we found evidence for SUSY,

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:26.311
we could go from understanding 5% of our universe,

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.715
the things we can actually see,

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.172
to around a third.

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.841
Not bad for a day's work.
