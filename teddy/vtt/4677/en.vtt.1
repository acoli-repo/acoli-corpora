00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:30.314
It says that by combining

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.176
the four basic elements in different ways,

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:35.346
you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.817
Earth and fire, for example,

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.975
give you things that are dry.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.822
Air and water, things that are wet.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:43.906
But as theories go, it had a problem.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.690
It didn't predict anything that could be measured,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.987
and measurement is the basis of experimental science.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.196
Worse still, the theory was wrong.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:54.698
But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind

00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:56.033
and in the 5th century B.C.,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.792
Leucippus of Miletus came up

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:01.080
with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever.
