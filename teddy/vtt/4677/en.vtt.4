00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.023
Well, we know because we look at things

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.024
and we see them.

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.316
That might seem rather simplistic,

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:03.860
but it's actually quite profound.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.197
All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible.

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.784
Light bounces off it, and we can see it.

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:09.844
When we look out into space,

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.540
we see stars and galaxies.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.537
Some of them, like the one we live in,

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:17.165
are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:18.794
When scientists first measured the motion

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:20.966
of groups of galaxies in the 1930's

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.254
and weighed the amount of matter they contained,

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:24.630
they were in for a surprise.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.298
They found that there's not enough visible stuff

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.349
in those groups to hold them together.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.348
Later measurements of individual galaxies
