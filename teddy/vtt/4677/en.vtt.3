00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.923
The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.497
is that atoms are, in fact, divisible.

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:35.742
Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:37.129
to explain just a small part

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.035
of what the universe is made of.

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.333
What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.713
is, in fact, quite rare.

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.849
Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of,

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.687
actually make up only about 5%

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:49.220
of what we know to be there.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.804
Physicists know the rest of the universe,

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.182
95% of it,

00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:53.975
as the dark universe,

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.643
made of dark matter and dark energy.

00:01:56.643 --> 00:01:57.607
How do we know this?

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.023
Well, we know because we look at things
