00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:30.196
from everything else,

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:31.492
as you would expect in a universe

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.599
that began in hot, dense big bang,

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.266
but that the universe's expansion

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.511
also seems to be accelerating.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.955
What's that about?

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:40.678
Either there is some kind of energy

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:41.956
pushing this acceleration,

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.450
just like you provide energy to accelerate a car,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.238
or gravity does not behave exactly as we think.

00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:49.875
Most scientists think it's the former,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.919
that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.170
and they called it &lt;i&gt;dark energy&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.006
Today's best measurements allow us to work out

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:59.300
just how much of the universe is dark.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.925
It looks as if dark energy makes up
