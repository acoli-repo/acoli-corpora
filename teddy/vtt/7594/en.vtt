00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:05.396
We're going to have hotter,
drier summers in our cities.

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:09.996
We're going to have to deal
with more frequent and intense heat waves.

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:12.756
It's going to have an impact
on our health and well-being,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:13.956
but not just us.

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:17.876
What about the plants and animals
that call our cities home?

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:19.836
So what could we do about that?

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.356
We could green our cities,
we could plant trees.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:26.116
The shade provided by trees
provides protection

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.196
from those impacts of the heat.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:32.516
But what do we need to make
those plants thrive and survive?
