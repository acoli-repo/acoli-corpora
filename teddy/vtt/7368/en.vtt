00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:04.836
I grew up in Bokaro Steel City
in eastern India,

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:06.356
an industrial townships

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:10.156
surrounded by power plants
and steel smelters.

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.556
One of my fondest memories as a child

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:17.676
was to stare in the evenings
at the beautiful orange skies

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:20.676
and flaring chimneys of the steel plant.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.676
Little did I know at that time

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:26.476
that these were all classic signs
of severe air pollution.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:30.756
Cities like Bokaro were dubbed
as the temples of modern India
