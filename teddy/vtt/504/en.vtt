This is a strange and wonderful brain,

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:10.973
one that gives rise to an idea
of a kind of alternative intelligence

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:12.163
on this planet.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.941
This is a brain that is formed
in a very strange body,

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:21.837
one that has the equivalent
of small satellite brains

00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:24.660
distributed throughout that body.

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:27.762
How different is it from the human brain?

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:29.930
Very different, so it seems,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:34.285
so much so that my colleagues and I
are struggling to understand
