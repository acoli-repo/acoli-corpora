00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:01.655
It was because of the impact on people,

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:05.077
and the impact on their rights --

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:10.232
their rights to food and safe water,
health, education and shelter.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:14.633
And I say this with humility,

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:18.592
because I came late
to the issue of climate change.

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.045
When I served

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.069
as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:25.323
from 1997 to 2002,

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:27.553
climate change wasn't
at the front of my mind.

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:31.474
I don't remember making
a single speech on climate change.
