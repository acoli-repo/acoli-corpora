00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:03.201
it was about changes in the climate --

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:06.145
climate shocks, changes in the weather.

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:08.887
I met Constance Okollet,

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.069
who had formed a women's group
in Eastern Uganda,

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:14.720
and she told me that
when she was growing up,

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:19.077
she had a very normal life in her village
and they didn't go hungry,

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:24.430
they knew that the seasons would come
as they were predicted to come,

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.231
they knew when to sow
and they knew when to harvest,

00:05:27.255 --> 00:05:29.627
and so they had enough food.
