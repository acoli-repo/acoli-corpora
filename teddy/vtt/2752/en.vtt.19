00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:33.189
And we shouldn't underestimate
the scale and the transformative nature

00:09:33.213 --> 00:09:35.950
of the change which will be needed,

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:42.563
because we have to go to zero
carbon emissions by about 2050,

00:09:42.587 --> 00:09:46.952
if we're going to stay below
two degrees Celsius of warming.

00:09:46.976 --> 00:09:51.976
And that means we have to leave
about two-thirds of the known resources

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.207
of fossil fuels in the ground.

00:09:54.564 --> 00:09:56.287
It's a very big change,

00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.843
and it means that obviously,

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.509
industrialized countries
must cut their emissions,
