00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:31.016
Governments around the world agreed
at the conference in Copenhagen,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.754
and have repeated it
at every conference on climate,

00:07:34.778 --> 00:07:38.238
that we have to stay
below two degrees Celsius

00:07:38.262 --> 00:07:41.649
of warming above pre-Industrial standards.

00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:44.585
But we're on course
for about four degrees.

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:49.482
So we face an existential threat
to the future of our planet.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.126
And that made me realize

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.233
that climate change is the greatest threat
to human rights in the 21st century.

00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.201
And that brought me then
to climate justice.
