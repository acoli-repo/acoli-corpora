WEBVTT

00:14:58.424 --> 00:15:01.203
the first one, in September in New York,

00:15:01.227 --> 00:15:04.512
is the summit for the sustainable
development goals.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:10.549
And then the summit in Paris in December,
to give us a climate agreement.

00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:17.692
The sustainable development goals
are intended to help countries

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:21.826
to live sustainably,
in tune with Mother Earth,

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:27.176
not to take out of Mother Earth
and destroy ecosystems,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.814
but rather, to live in harmony
with Mother Earth,
