00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.180
and using my elbows!

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:33.017
(Laughter)

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.030
And those issues stayed
with me and guided me,

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.680
and in particular,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:42.254
when I was elected the first
woman President of Ireland,

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:45.174
from 1990 to 1997.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.056
I dedicated my presidency

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.537
to having a space for those who felt
marginalized on the island of Ireland,

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:56.290
and bringing together communities
from Northern Ireland

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.054
with those from the Republic,

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.028
trying to build peace.
