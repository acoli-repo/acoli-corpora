00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.294
2.6 billion people cook on open fires --

00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:05.303
on coal, wood and animal dung.

00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:10.001
And this causes
about 4 million deaths a year

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:12.247
from indoor smoke inhalation,

00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.181
and of course, most of those
who die are women.

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:20.633
So we have a very unequal world,

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:27.101
and we need to change
from "business as usual."

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:33.189
And we shouldn't underestimate
the scale and the transformative nature
