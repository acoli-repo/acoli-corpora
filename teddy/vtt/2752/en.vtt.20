00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.509
industrialized countries
must cut their emissions,

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.604
must become much more energy-efficient,

00:10:03.628 --> 00:10:07.564
and must move as quickly as possible
to renewable energy.

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:12.579
For developing countries
and emerging economies,

00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:17.160
the problem and the challenge
is to grow without emissions,

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:20.498
because they must develop;
they have very poor populations.

00:10:20.522 --> 00:10:26.282
So they must develop without emissions,
and that is a different kind of problem.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.605
Indeed, no country in the world
has actually grown without emissions.
