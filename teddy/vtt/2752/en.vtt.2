00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.725
and met with Queen Elizabeth II,

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.557
and also welcomed to my
official residence --

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:16.360
which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin,"
the house of the president --

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.630
members of the royal family,

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:21.434
including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:28.308

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:33.304
Ireland was a country beginning
a rapid economic progress.
