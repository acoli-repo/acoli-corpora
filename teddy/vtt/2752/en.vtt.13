00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:30.451
emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:36.690
The average US citizen emits
about 17.5 metric tons.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:40.817
So those who are suffering
disproportionately

00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:47.682
don't drive cars, don't have electricity,
don't consume very significantly,

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.864
and yet they are feeling more and more

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:55.277
the impacts of the changes in the climate,

00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:59.570
the changes that are preventing them
from knowing how to grow food properly,

00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:03.213
and knowing how
to look after their future.
