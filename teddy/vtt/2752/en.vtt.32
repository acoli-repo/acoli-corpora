So we need to take steps
that will be monitored and reviewed,

00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:05.979
so that we can keep increasing
the ambition of how we cut emissions,

00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:09.119
and how we move more rapidly
to renewable energy,

00:16:09.143 --> 00:16:12.146
so that we have a safe world.

00:16:15.665 --> 00:16:21.848
The reality is that this issue
is much too important

00:16:21.872 --> 00:16:25.435
to be left to politicians
and to the United Nations.

00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:26.460
(Laughter)

00:16:26.484 --> 00:16:28.062
It's an issue for all of us,

00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:32.050
and it's an issue where we need
more and more momentum.
