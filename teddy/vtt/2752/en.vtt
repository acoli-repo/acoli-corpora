A question I'm often asked is,

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:13.975
where did I get my passion
for human rights and justice?

00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:15.842
It started early.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.792
I grew up in the west of Ireland,

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.877
wedged between four brothers,

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:23.298
two older than me and two younger than me.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:26.906
So of course I had to be
interested in human rights,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.435
and equality and justice,

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.180
and using my elbows!
