00:10:56.007 --> 00:11:00.655
This is an issue that requires
complete human solidarity.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:04.643
Human solidarity, if you like,
based on self-interest --

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:06.947
because we are all in this together,

00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:08.366
and we have to work together

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.780
to ensure that we reach
zero carbon by 2050.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:17.438
The good news is that change is happening,

00:11:17.462 --> 00:11:19.366
and it's happening very fast.

00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:21.405
Here in California,

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:25.435
there's a very ambitious
emissions target to cut emissions.

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:28.771
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:33.421
to have 100 percent
renewable energy by 2045.
