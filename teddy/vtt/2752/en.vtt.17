00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:34.231
it's very striking how many
people are left behind.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:40.937
In our world of 7.2 billion people,
about 3 billion are left behind.

00:08:41.262 --> 00:08:45.675
1.3 billion don't have access
to electricity,

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:49.203
and they light their homes
with kerosene and candles,

00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:50.902
both of which are dangerous.

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:57.417

tiny income on that form of lighting.
