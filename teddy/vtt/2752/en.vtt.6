00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:05.383
As I listened to President Tong
describing the situation,

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:11.778
I really felt that this was a problem
that no leader should have to face.

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:17.960
And as I heard him speak
about the pain of his problems,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:20.380
I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:26.079
I thought about her
and those who worked with her

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:31.181
on the Commission on Human Rights,
which she chaired in 1948,
