both the fiscal and mental health costs,

00:04:32.118 --> 00:04:33.385
it's just stunning.

00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:37.355
AG: One notable experiment
was done with medical teams in Israel.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.593
Each team had a physician and two nurses
from the newborn intensive care unit,

00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:44.403
and they were brought in
to work with a visiting expert.

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:47.529
Some teams were randomly assigned
to be berated by the expert.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:50.752
He told them he wasn't impressed
with the quality of medicine there,

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:53.534
and they wouldn't last a week
in his department.

00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:55.641
After being insulted like this,

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:59.615
the accuracy of the team's diagnoses
was almost 20 percent lower.
