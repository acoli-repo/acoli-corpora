00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:30.800
and being demeaning.

00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:34.053
Being demanding is having
extremely high standards

00:09:34.077 --> 00:09:36.916
and pretty low tolerance
for work that falls below them.

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:41.708
Being demeaning is devaluing
other people as human beings,

00:09:41.732 --> 00:09:45.132
treating them with such disrespect
that they feel worthless.

00:09:45.911 --> 00:09:49.080
WI: When I asked Steve,
"Did you have to be so mean?

00:09:49.104 --> 00:09:50.991
Did you have to be so cruel to people?"

00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:54.268
He said to me, "You know,
when people do something that sucks,

00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:55.967
I just have to tell them it sucks,

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.496
because I'm just a middle-class kid,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.228
trying to make sure I don't have
B players on my team.
