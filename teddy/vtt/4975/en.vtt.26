00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:02.040
And so the conversation isn't about,
you know, letting her have it

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:03.325
and straightening her out

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:06.200
and letting her know
she shouldn't be an asshole next time.

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:07.858
The conversation is about,

00:13:07.882 --> 00:13:10.200
"Now I'm just curious
what was going on with you,

00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:11.712
because I was surprised by it,

00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:15.268
and we should address it

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:17.784
so that we just won't have
this problem next time."

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:23.888
That's an orientation that is much more
likely to produce a better conversation

00:13:23.912 --> 00:13:26.043
and to solve the problem,
if it's solvable.
