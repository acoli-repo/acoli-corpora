WI: When I started
working on "Steve Jobs,"

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:03.355
Woz -- Wozniak -- said to me,

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:07.537
"The main question you have to answer
is: Did he have to be so mean?"

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.664
AG: "Ruthless," "deceitful," "cruel" --

00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:13.561
these are words that have often
been applied to Jobs,

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:16.185
very frequently by his closest friends.

00:08:16.784 --> 00:08:20.725
Early on, Jobs screwed his cofounder
out of a big bonus and lied about it.

00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.292
He screamed and swore at colleagues,
belittled employees

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:27.645
and harassed interviewees
by asking about their sex lives.

00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:31.991
This kind of behavior was what led Jobs
to get forced out of Apple --
