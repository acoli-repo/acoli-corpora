00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.649
And that's the conversation
that we need to have,

00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:32.776
because I don't know what was up with you,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.795
but whatever it was, it's a problem.

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:38.156
So let's figure that out
and see if we can fix it.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.488
AG: That's fantastic.

00:12:39.512 --> 00:12:43.596
Yeah, because that motivates me then
to go and find out whatever I'm missing.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.275
I'll go and try to learn:

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:47.610
What were you thinking?
What was your intent?

00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:49.719
What was going on in that situation?

00:12:49.743 --> 00:12:50.901
That's really helpful.

00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:54.347
SH: I love the orientation
that that just created for you,

00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.424
which is that now you actually have
a little bit of curiosity.

00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:02.040
And so the conversation isn't about,
you know, letting her have it
