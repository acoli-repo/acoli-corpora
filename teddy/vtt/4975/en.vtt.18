as he put it.

00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:04.799
AG: I think we both know
a fair number of entrepreneurs

00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:06.826
who have held Jobs up as their role model

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.458
and said, "Look, he wasn't
the nicest guy in the world.

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:14.266
And that's proof that this is
sometimes how you have to be."

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:22.387
WI: I guess my answer, in retrospect,

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.537
is no, you don't have to be that mean.

00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:26.886
You don't have to be cruel to people.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.442
AG: There's a huge difference
between being demanding

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:30.800
and being demeaning.
