AG: Look, I know it's not a polite word.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:02.697
But it's not going away.

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.388
And neither are assholes.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.895
And the word itself evokes a feeling in us

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.577
that something tamer
like "jerk" just doesn't.

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:13.688
So we're going to use the word,
because that's what the pros do.

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:16.260
Bob Sutton: I said, "I want
to use the word 'asshole,'

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.951
and you would never publish that
in 'Harvard Business Review.'"

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:21.402
She said, "Try me."
