AG: Are you deliberately avoiding
using the word "asshole"?

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.347
CH: (Laughs) Yes, I am, actually.

00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:06.217
I don't think I want to use it.

00:41:06.873 --> 00:41:09.783
I just think, if my mother
ever listens to this podcast,

00:41:09.807 --> 00:41:11.810
she wouldn't appreciate
if I use that word.

00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:15.730
AG: ... as opposed to my last interview
who said "asshole" every four words.
