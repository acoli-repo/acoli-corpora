00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:01.471
BS: There's research
from fast-food restaurants

00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:05.860
that when people have an abusive
supervisor running the restaurant

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.901
that employees are more likely to steal.

00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:10.604
AG: (Laughs) Although,
if they're stealing fast food,

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.311
they're only punishing themselves.

00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:13.402
BS: (Laughs)

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:16.786
(Music)

00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:20.167
When I talk about the cost
of assholes at work,

00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:22.056
there are people who push back.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.309
They say, sometimes you just need
to be an asshole to be successful.

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:28.978
And there's one example
that pops up every time.

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:31.607
Let's call it "the Steve Jobs question."
