00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:00.461
Professor: Excuse me, can't you read?

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.993
There's a sign on the door

00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:04.977
that tells you the experiment
will be in room 123,

00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.667
but you didn't even bother
to look at the door, did you?

00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:10.905
Instead you prefer to disturb me
and ask for directions,

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:13.807
when you can clearly see that I'm busy.

00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:17.172
I'm not a secretary here,
I'm a busy professor.

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:18.346
(Door slams)

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.292
AG: What an asshole!

00:06:20.823 --> 00:06:23.752
The poor students who were randomly
assigned to that treatment

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.656
were then asked to solve some anagrams.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.497
And they solved a quarter fewer
anagrams correctly.

00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:31.632
Then the students saw someone
drop a bunch of books.
