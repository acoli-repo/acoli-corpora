She cofounded a company
that specializes in conflict mediation

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.571
and coauthored the book
"Difficult Conversations."

00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:07.190
Basically, Sheila's job is teaching people
how to deal with an asshole --

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:09.348
and how to avoid acing like one.

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:14.220
SH: Part of the job of lawyers in society
is to help people with conflicts.

00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:18.765
And the way that we / they
sometimes go about it

00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:22.851
often ends up escalating the conflict
rather than helping resolve it.

00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:26.759
And that's essentially the definition
of asshole-like behavior.

00:11:26.783 --> 00:11:31.085
AG: But sometimes the conflict happens
because one person is just an asshole.
