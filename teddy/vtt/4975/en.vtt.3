AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.340
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:39.658
I study how to make
the people you work with not suck.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.573
In this show,

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:44.717
I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people,

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:48.029
because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:51.441
Today: assholes, a field guide.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.756
Everyone's worked with at least one.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.168
How do you deal with them?

00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:58.783
And is it possible to create
an asshole-free office?

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:02.682
