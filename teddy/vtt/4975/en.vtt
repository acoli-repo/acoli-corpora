Adam Grant: Alright, Geoff,
start with your name and occupation.

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:07.030
Geoff Nunberg: My name is Geoff Nunberg.
I'm a professor and a linguist.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.717
AG: How in the world does a linguist
end up writing a book about assholes?

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:14.719
GN: Well, who better than a linguist?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.725
AG: Heads up: this episode
is going to use a lot of that word.

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.653
GN: Linguist.
AG: No, not that one.

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:21.828
GN: Bounder.
AG: No.

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:23.003
GN: Cad.
AG: No.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:25.775
GN: Heel, phony.
AG: No and no.

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:29.609
GN: Those words all articulated
a certain sense of the moral life.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.278
And "asshole" comes along
and kind of displaces them.
