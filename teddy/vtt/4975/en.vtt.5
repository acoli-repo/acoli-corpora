But "asshat" and "assclown"
don't have the same sting.

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:33.645
They're mostly synonyms for "obnoxious."

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.529
An asshole is someone who disrespects
and demeans other people

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.791
and either denies it or just doesn't care.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.402
Think about the assholes
you've had to work with.

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.013
How did they show it?

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.236

doling out blame unfairly,

00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:53.802
invading privacy, breaking promises.

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:56.511
Other times, it's active-aggressive:

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:59.641
badmouthing, screaming, ridiculing.

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:02.192
