(Laughter)

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:06.851
I also ask that you remember this:

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:12.268
we are all far more intimately connected
with the oceans than we realize,

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:14.458
no matter where we live.

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:17.226
And this level of intimacy

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.268
requires a new kind
of relationship with the ocean,

00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:26.518
one that recognizes and respects
the enormous diversity of life

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.375
and its limitations.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.226
We can no longer think of the oceans
