00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.250
for the partnership to work.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:05.226
The next time you're thinking
about having seafood,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.601
look for sustainably caught
or farmed species

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:11.518
that are local and low on the food chain.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:14.643
These are animals
like oysters, clams, mussels,

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:17.101
small fish like mackerel.

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:19.018
These all reproduce like crazy,

00:11:19.042 --> 00:11:22.333
and with good management,
they can handle a bit of fishing pressure.

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:25.934
We can also rethink
what we use to wash our bodies,

00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.268
clean our homes

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:28.976
and care for our lawns.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.309
All of those chemicals
eventually wash out to sea
