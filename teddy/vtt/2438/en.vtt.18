00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:00.809
It's really strange.

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.601
But if we don't know
that these kinds of strategies exist

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.184
or how they work,

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:10.184
we can't know what kind of impacts
we may be having, even in the deep sea.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:11.643
Just three years ago,

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:14.643
we discovered a new species
of deep sea octopus

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:18.643
where the females lay their eggs
on sponges attached to rocks

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.750
that are over two and a half miles deep.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.143
These rocks contain rare earth minerals,

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.393
and right now there are companies
that are building bulldozers

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:31.934
that would be capable of mining
the deep sea floor for those rocks.
