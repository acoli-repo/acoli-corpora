00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.184
Fishers are not allowed
to target tiny fish.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:04.226
This allows baby fish to grow
and reproduce before they're caught.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.893
That's a good thing.

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.184
So fishers go after the biggest fish.

00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:12.059
But in parrotfish, for example,
or any sex changer,

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:17.167
targeting the biggest fish means
that they're taking out all the males.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:19.893
That makes it hard for a female fish

00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:21.518
to find a mate

00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:24.726
or it forces her to change sex sooner

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.250
at a smaller size.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.601
Both of these things can result
in fewer fish babies in the future.
