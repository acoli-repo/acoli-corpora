have to be able to make fish

To do that, they have to have

And until recently,

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:11.393
we really didn't know
how sex happened in the sea.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:13.351
It's pretty hard to study.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:16.268
But thanks to new science and technology,

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:19.893
we now know so much more
than even just a few years ago,

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:23.268
and these new discoveries
are showing two things.

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:26.792
First, sex in the sea is really funky.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.601
