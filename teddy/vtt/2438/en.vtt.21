00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.226
We can no longer think of the oceans

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.309
as just something out there,

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:37.309
because every day we depend on them
for our food security,

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.101
our own health and wellness,

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:41.667
and every other breath we take.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.559
But it is a two-way relationship,

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:48.351
and the oceans can only continue
to provide for us

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:53.143
if we in turn safeguard
that fundamental force of life in the sea:

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:55.042
sex and reproduction.

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:59.768
So, like any relationship,
we have to embrace some change

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.250
for the partnership to work.
