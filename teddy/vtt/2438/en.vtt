00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:02.393
Right now,

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:05.268
beneath a shimmering blue sea,

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:09.101
millions of fish are having sex.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.476
(Cheers)

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.934
And the way they're doing it
and strategies they're using

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.708
looks nothing like what we see on land.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.559
Take parrotfish.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:25.434
In this species, all fish are born female,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.393
and they look like this.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:28.726
Then later in life,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.208
she can transition into a male
and she'll look like this.
