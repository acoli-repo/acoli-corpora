00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.601
Both of these things can result
in fewer fish babies in the future.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.101
In order for us to properly care
for these species,

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.351
we have to know if they change sex,

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.625
how and when.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:42.143
Only then can we create rules
that can support these sexual strategies,

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:45.917
such as setting a maximum size limit
in addition to a minimum one.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:50.351
The challenge isn't that we can't think
of these sex-friendly solutions.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:54.184
The challenge is knowing
which solutions to apply to which species,

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:57.351
because even animals we know really well

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.750
surprise us when it comes
to their sex lives.
