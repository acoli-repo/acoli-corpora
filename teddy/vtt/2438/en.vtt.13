After that, the sex is easy.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.976
So how are we interrupting
this kind of kinky courtship?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.684
Well, the female's urine
carries a critical chemical signal

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.643
that works because
it can pass through seawater

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.434
and lobsters have a smell receptor

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.542
that can detect and receive the message.

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:54.851
Climate change is making
our oceans more acidic.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.893
It's the result of too much
carbon dioxide entering seawater.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:02.226
This changing chemistry
could scramble that message,
