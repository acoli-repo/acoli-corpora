00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.393
We need millions of oysters and corals
to build the giant reefs

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.351
that protect our shorelines
from rising seas and storms.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.518
We depend on medicines that are found
in marine animals to fight cancer

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:41.268
and other diseases.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.684
And for many of us,

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:47.018
the diversity and beauty of the oceans
is where we turn for recreation

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.833
and relaxation and our cultural heritage.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.559
In order for us to continue
to benefit from the abundance

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.559
that ocean life provides,

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.809
the fish and coral and shrimp of today

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.601
have to be able to make fish
and shrimp and coral for tomorrow.
