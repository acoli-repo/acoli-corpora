00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.143
Fanfin anglerfish live at about
3,000 feet below the surface

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.059
in the pitch-black waters,

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:41.518
and the males are born
without the ability to feed themselves.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:45.708
To survive, he has to find a female fast.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.976
Meanwhile, the female,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.018
who is 10 times bigger than the male,

00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:53.434
10 times,

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:58.351
she lets out a very strong pheromone
with which to attract mates to her.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:01.101
So this tiny male is swimming
through the black waters
