Nemo's dad Marlin
would have transitioned into Marlene --

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.768
(Laughter)

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.851
and Nemo would have likely mated
with his father turned mother.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.059
(Laughter)

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:37.351
You can see --

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.559
(Laughter)

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:40.833
Yeah.

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:44.559
You can see why Pixar

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.226
took a little creative license
with the plotline, right?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.601
(Laughter)

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.934
So sex change in the ocean
can happen in either direction

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.226
and sometimes even back and forth,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.476
and that's just one of the many
amazing strategies animals use

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.268
to reproduce in the ocean.
