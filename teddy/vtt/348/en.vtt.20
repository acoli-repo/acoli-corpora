00:09:56.917 --> 00:10:00.266
where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.049
to waiting?

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:03.266
What if we had a waiting room

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.367
where you don't just sit when you're sick,

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:07.233
but where you go to get healthy.

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:09.750
If airports can become shopping malls

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.716
and McDonald's can become playgrounds,

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:16.149
surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.183
And that's what Health Leads has tried to do,

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:20.466
to reclaim that real estate and that time

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:21.898
and to use it as a gateway

00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:22.950
to connect patients

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.717
to the resources they need to be healthy.

00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:27.233
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:29.700
your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.867
and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,
