00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:03.156
but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,

00:08:03.156 --> 00:08:06.822
using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.

00:08:06.822 --> 00:08:09.055
The problem is,

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.254
once you get a taste of what it's like

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:13.489
to realize your aspiration for healthcare,

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.007

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:15.770
So we thought,

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:23.305
could we get an entire healthcare system

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:26.057

00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:27.304
And we gave it a shot.

00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:28.739
So now at Harlem Hospital Center

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:32.525
when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,
