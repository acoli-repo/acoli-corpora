They said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic --

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.627
child has an ear infection,

00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:36.560
I prescribe antibiotics.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.393
But the real issue is there's no food at home.

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:40.894

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.667
And I don't even have any help."

00:02:58.667 --> 00:02:59.867
