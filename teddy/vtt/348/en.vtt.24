00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.065
when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.

00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.418
College sports teams say,

00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:03.483
"We're going to take dozens of hours

00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:07.367
at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:10.183
and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,

00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:12.349
and if you don't measure up or you don't show up,

00:12:12.349 --> 00:12:13.799
we're going to cut you off the team.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.687
But we'll make huge investments

00:12:15.687 --> 00:12:16.899
in your training and development,

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:20.317
and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."

00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:22.132
And people line up out the door

00:12:22.132 --> 00:12:24.917
just for the chance to be part of it.

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.134
So our feeling is,

00:12:26.134 --> 00:12:27.617
if it's good enough for the rugby team,

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:29.732
it's good enough for health and poverty.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:33.000
