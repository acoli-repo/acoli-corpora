00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.595
And at the end of my freshman year of college,

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.279
I read an article about the work

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.061
that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.197
as Chair of Pediatrics

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.597
at Boston Medical Center.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.664
And his first hire was a legal services attorney

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:43.546
to represent the patients.

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:45.061
So I called Barry,

00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.664
and with his blessing, in October 1995

00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:49.729
walked into the waiting room

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.595
of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:53.928
I'll never forget,

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:56.812
the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.746
And the exhaustion of mothers

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:03.278
who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses
