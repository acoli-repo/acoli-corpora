00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.944
So my freshman year of college

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:04.694
I signed up for an internship in the housing unit

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:06.894
at Greater Boston Legal Services.

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:08.547
Showed up the first day

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:10.863
ready to make coffee and photocopies,

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:15.445
but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:16.914
named Jeff Purcell,

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.379
who thrust me onto the front lines

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.379
from the very first day.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:23.144
And over the course of nine months

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:24.157
I had the chance

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.929
to have dozens of conversations

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.713
with low-income families in Boston

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:31.829
who would come in presenting with housing issues,
