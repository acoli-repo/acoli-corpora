00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.867
and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.399
because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:37.316
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,

00:10:37.316 --> 00:10:39.516
the waiting room became the place

00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:42.000
where Health Leads turned your heat back on?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.618
And of course all of this requires

00:10:43.618 --> 00:10:45.566

and even social workers

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:53.934
aren't enough,

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:55.583
that the ticking minutes of health care

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.001
are too constraining.

00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.050
Health just takes more time.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.849
It requires a non-clinical army
