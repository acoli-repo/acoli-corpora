00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:32.236
who work side by side with these families

00:03:32.236 --> 00:03:33.535
to connect them out

00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:36.751
to the existing landscape of community resources.

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.300
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room --

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.450
totally lemonade stand style.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.770
But today we have a thousand college student advocates

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.070
who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.271
with the resources that they need to be healthy.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.787
So 18 months ago

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:57.572
I got this email that changed my life.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:03:59.987
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.971
who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads
