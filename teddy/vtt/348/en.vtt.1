00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:31.829
who would come in presenting with housing issues,

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.113
but always had an underlying health issue.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:37.345

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:41.951
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course,

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.237

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:57.012
was actually to send me into the home of these clients

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:59.145
with these large glass bottles.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.145
And I would collect the cockroaches,
