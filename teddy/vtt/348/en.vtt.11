How is it that if for decades

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.058
we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,

00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:37.655
and especially low-income patients, healthy,

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.556
that we didn't use it?

00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:42.655
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system

00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:45.154
rather than a sick-care system,

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:47.187
why don't we just do it?

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:49.421
These questions, in my mind,

00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.487
are not hard because the answers are complicated,

00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:57.621
they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.721
My belief is that it's almost too painful
