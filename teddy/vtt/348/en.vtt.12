00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.721
My belief is that it's almost too painful

00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:03.950
to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.688
or even admit that we have any at all.

00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:28.455
and listen quietly,

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.271
that we all harbor
