00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.971
who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:04.270
and to share, as he said,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.906
a bit of historical context.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:09.856
In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:12.870
one of the first two community health centers in this country,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.021
in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.537
And so many of his patients came in

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:20.687
presenting with malnutrition

00:04:20.687 --> 00:04:23.171
that be began prescribing food for them.

00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.422
And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,

00:04:26.422 --> 00:04:27.520
which would fill them

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.338
and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
