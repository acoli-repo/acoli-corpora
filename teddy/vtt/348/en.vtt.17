00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:32.525
when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.389
the electronic medical record

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.189
automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:39.655
And our volunteers can then work with them

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:42.872
to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:44.304
in their communities.

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:45.438
We've created a presumption

00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:47.005
that if you're a patient at that hospital

00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:48.555
with an elevated BMI,

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:50.789
the four walls of the doctor's office

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:52.641
probably aren't going to give you everything

00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:53.823
you need to be healthy.

00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:55.223
You need more.

00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:55.904
So on the one hand,

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.601
this is just a basic recoding

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.306
of the electronic medical record.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.024
And on the other hand,
