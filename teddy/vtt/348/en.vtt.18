00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.024
And on the other hand,

00:09:01.024 --> 00:09:02.673
it's a radical transformation

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:04.841
of the electronic medical record

00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:08.723

00:09:08.723 --> 00:09:11.557
to a health promotion tool.

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:12.674
In the private sector,

00:09:12.674 --> 00:09:15.294
when you squeeze that kind of additional value

00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:17.041

00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:21.022
But in my world,

00:09:24.423 --> 00:09:26.306
It's called healthcare --

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:29.289
a system where doctors can prescribe solutions

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:30.839
to improve health,
