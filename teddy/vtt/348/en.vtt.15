00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.357
but what do patients need to be healthy,

00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:34.904
to not get sick in the first place?

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.755
And we chose to use the prescription

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.537
for that purpose.

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:39.739
So just a few miles from here

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:41.523
at Children's National Medical Center,

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.789
when patients come into the doctor's office,

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.474
they're asked a few questions.

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:48.138
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?

00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:49.704
Do you have safe housing?"

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.773
And when the doctor begins the visit,

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.606
she knows height, weight, is there food at home,

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:56.222
is the family living in a shelter.

00:07:56.222 --> 00:07:59.106
And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,

00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:03.156
but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,
