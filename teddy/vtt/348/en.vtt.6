00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.553
there are two social workers

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:04.284
for 24,000 pediatric patients,

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.136
which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.167
So Health Leads was born of these conversations --

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:11.351
a simple model

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.866
where doctors and nurses

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.084
can prescribe nutritious food,

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:16.386
heat in the winter

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.968
and other basic resources for their patients

00:03:18.968 --> 00:03:21.519
the same way they prescribe medication.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.500
Patients then take their prescriptions

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.967
to our desk in the clinic waiting room

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.784
where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:32.236
who work side by side with these families
