AM: He liked about 50 of my photos,

00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:11.663
back-to-back,
in the middle of the night --

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:16.172
PA: What I saw was an artist
committed to truth and justice --

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.784

AM: Our story actually begins

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:29.642
PA: Well, I was born in Chicago,

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.719
the son of a preacher and a teacher.
