Restaurants and the food industry in general

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
are pretty much the most wasteful industry

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the world.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
10 calories are taken to produce it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's a lot.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to take something rather humble

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to discuss.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I found this in the farmers' market today,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The humble potato --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it pretty much goes through

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
eight different forms in its lifetime.
