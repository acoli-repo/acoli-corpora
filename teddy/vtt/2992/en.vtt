00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:04.656
So I'd like to tell you a story
about climate and change,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.346
but it's really a story about people
and not polar bears.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.176
So this is our house
that we lived in in the mid-2000s.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.976
I was the chief operating officer
for the Navy's weather and ocean service.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.896
It happened to be down at a place
called Stennis Space Center

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.176
right on the Gulf Coast,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.915
so we lived in a little town
called Waveland, Mississippi,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.456
nice modest house, and as you can see,
it's up against a storm surge.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.136
Now, if you ever wonder
