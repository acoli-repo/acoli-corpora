00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.016
So I don't show this for pity,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.456
because in many ways, we were
the luckiest people on the Gulf Coast.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.336
One of the things is, we had insurance,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.776
and that idea of insurance
is probably pretty important there.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.736
But does this scale up,
you know, what happened here?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.016
And I think it kind of does,
because as you've heard,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.736
as the sea levels come up,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.656
it takes weaker and weaker storms
to do something like this.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.576
So let's just step back for a second
and kind of look at this.
