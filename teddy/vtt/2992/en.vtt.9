00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.496
Now we're going to go 2,000 kilometers,
or about 1,200 miles, north of Oslo,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.056
only 600 miles from the Pole,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.616
and this is arguably

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.896
the most strategic island
you've never heard of.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.496
It's a place called Svalbard.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.736
It sits astride the sea lanes

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.016
that the Russian Northern Fleet needs
to get out and go into warmer waters.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.016
It is also, by virtue of its geography,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.576
a place where you can control
every single polar orbiting satellite

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.856
on every orbit.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.496
It is the strategic high ground of space.
