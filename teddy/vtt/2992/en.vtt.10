00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.496
It is the strategic high ground of space.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.776
Climate change has greatly reduced
the sea ice around here,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.616
greatly increasing human activity,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.136
and it's becoming a flashpoint,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.216
and in fact the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.256
is going to meet here
on Svalbard next month.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.016
The Russians are very,
very unhappy about that.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.696
So if you want to find
a flashpoint in the Arctic,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.360
look at Svalbard there.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.216
Now, in the military,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.576
we have known for decades,
if not centuries,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.616
that the time to prepare,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.376
whether it's for a hurricane,
a typhoon or strategic changes,
