Now, you would like to think

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.536
that there was somebody
in Assad's office that said,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.656
"Hey boss, you know,
we're in the eastern Mediterranean,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.136
kind of dry here,
maybe not the best idea."

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.616
But I think what happened was,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.736
"Boss, you are a smart, powerful
and handsome man. We'll get right on it."

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.976
And they did.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.936
So by the '90s, believe it or not,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.376
they were actually
self-sufficient in food,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.976
but they did it at a great cost.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.936
They did it at a cost of their aquifers,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.096
they did it at a cost
of their surface water.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.336
And of course, there are
many nonclimate issues
