00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.576
So let's just step back for a second
and kind of look at this.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.176
And, you know,
climate's really complicated,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.976
a lot of moving parts in this,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.896
but I kind of put it about
it's all about the water.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.296
See, see those three blue dots
there down on the lower part?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.616
The one you can easily see,
that's all the water in the world.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.096
Those two smaller dots,
those are the fresh water.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.456
And it turns out
that as the climate changes,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.976
the distribution of that water
is changing very fundamentally.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.736
So now we have too much, too little,
wrong place, wrong time.
