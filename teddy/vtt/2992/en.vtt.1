Now, if you ever wonder

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.616
what a 30-foot or nine-meter
storm surge does

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.696
coming up your street,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.336
let me show you.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.696
Same house.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.256
That's me, kind of wondering what's next.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.776
But when we say we lost our house --
this is, like, right after Katrina --

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.616
so the house is either all the way
up there in the railway tracks,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.456
or it's somewhere down there
in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.656
and to this day,
we really, we lost our house.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.936
We don't know where it is.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.216
(Laughter)

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.096
You know, it's gone.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.016
So I don't show this for pity,
