00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.736
So now we have too much, too little,
wrong place, wrong time.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.336
It's salty where it should be fresh;
it's liquid where it should be frozen;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.936
it's wet where it should be dry;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.735
and in fact, the very chemistry
of the ocean itself is changing.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.696
And what that does
from a security or a military part

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.976
is it does three things:

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.576
it changes the very operating
environment that we're working in,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.176
it threatens our bases,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.696
and then it has geostrategic risks,
which sounds kind of fancy

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.976
and I'll explain what I mean
by that in a second.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.496
So let's go to just
a couple examples here.
