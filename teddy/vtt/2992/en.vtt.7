00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.336
And of course, there are
many nonclimate issues

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.056
that also contributed to Syria.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.296
There was the Iraq War,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.736
and as you can see
by that lower blue line there,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.976
over a million refugees
come into the cities.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.736
And then about a decade ago,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.896
there's this tremendous
heat wave and drought --

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.976
fingerprints all over that show,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.216
yes, this is in fact related
to the changing climate --

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.176
has put another three quarters
of a million farmers

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.096
into those same cities.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.600
Why? Because they had nothing.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.176
They had dust. They had dirt.
They had nothing.
