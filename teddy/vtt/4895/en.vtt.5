Systems in our universe move from order to disorder,

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.456
and it is that property of the universe

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:38.416
that defines the direction of time’s arrow.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.446
So if time is such a fundamental property,

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:44.116
it should be in our most fundamental equations

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:46.686
describing the universe, right?

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:48.026
We currently have two sets of

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.916
equations that govern physics.

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:52.121
General relativity describes the

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.311
behavior of very large things,

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:58.251
while quantum physics explains the very small.

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.871
One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics
