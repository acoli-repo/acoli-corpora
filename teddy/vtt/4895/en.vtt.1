00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
and season to season to build calendars.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.840
More precise time-keeping, like sundials

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
and mechanical clocks, eventually came along

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.720
to put time in more convenient boxes.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.485
But what exactly is it that we’re measuring?

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.765
Is time something that physically exists,

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.995
or is it just in our heads?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.296
At first the answer seems obvious—

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.966
of course time exists;

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.246
it constantly unfolds all around us,

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.536
and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.956
But our understanding of time started

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.226
getting complicated thanks to Einstein.
