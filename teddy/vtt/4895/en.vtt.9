or contains the passage of time,

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.481
but it’s a property that comes out of how

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.591
the pieces are strung together.

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:41.041
The movement is real, yet also an illusion.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:45.641
Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion?

00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.461
Physicists are still exploring these and other questions,

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:52.101
so we’re far from a complete explanation.

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:54.411
At least for the moment.
