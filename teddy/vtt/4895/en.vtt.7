00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.171
if it or a similarly time-starved equation

00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:33.541
turned out to be true, would that mean

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:37.091
that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level?

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.681
Could time just be some sort of illusion generated

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:42.351
by the limitations of the way

00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:44.091
we perceive the universe?

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.191
We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.981
the wrong way of thinking about it.

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.191
Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property,

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:55.711
maybe it could exist as an emergent one.

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:59.711
Emergent properties are things that don’t exist

00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.871
in individual pieces of a system,
