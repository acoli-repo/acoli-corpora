00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.226
getting complicated thanks to Einstein.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.646
His theory of relativity tells us that time

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.526
passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.916
at the same rate for people in different situations,

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.566
like those travelling close to the speed of light

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.006
or orbiting a supermassive black hole.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.196
Einstein resolved the malleability of time

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:24.816
by combining it with space to define space-time,

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:29.856
which can bend, but behaves
in consistent, predictable ways.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.386
Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time
