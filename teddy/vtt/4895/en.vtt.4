00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.306
we instinctively know that the coloring

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.206
will drift out from the drop,

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.366
eventually filling the glass.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.906
Imagine watching the opposite happen.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:11.346
Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards.

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.996
We live in a universe where the food coloring

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:15.556
spreads out in the water, 


00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:18.106
not a universe where it collects together.


00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.856
In physics, this is described by

00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:23.126
the Second Law of Thermodynamics,

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.116
which says that systems will gain disorder,

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.786
or entropy, over time.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:32.506
Systems in our universe move from order to disorder,
