00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.871
in individual pieces of a system,

00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.751
but do exist for the system as a whole.

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.471
Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide,

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.941
but the whole ocean does.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:13.821
A movie creates change through time by using

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:17.461
a series of still images that appear to have a fluid,

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.761
continuous change between them.

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:21.741
Flipping through the images fast enough,

00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:24.461
our brains perceive the passage of time

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.801
from the sequence of still images.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.701
No individual frame of the movie changes

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.181
or contains the passage of time,
