00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.871
One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.941
over the last half century has been reconciling

00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.771
the two into one fundamental “theory of everything."

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.401
There have been many attempts

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.101
—none yet proven—

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.351
and they treat time in different ways.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.091
Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.661
equation, doesn’t include time at all.

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.991
Like all current theories of everything,

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.131
that equation is speculative.

00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.841
But as a thought experiment,

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.171
if it or a similarly time-starved equation
