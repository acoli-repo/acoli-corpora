00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:02.545
Now in this movie,
that his client had written,

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.125
Leo would play an oil industry lobbyist

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.122
whose girlfriend, a local meteorologist,
threatens to leave him

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.376
because his work contributes
to global warming.

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:13.291
And this is a situation
that's been brought to a head

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.196
by the fact that there's a hurricane
forming in the Atlantic

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.585
that's threatening to do Maria-like damage
from Maine to Myrtle Beach.

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.664
Leo, very sad about
this impending break up,

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:23.887
does a little more research
about the hurricane

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.355
and discovers that in its path
across the Atlantic,

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.635
it will pass over a long-dormant,
though now active volcano

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.842
that will spew toxic ash into its eye
