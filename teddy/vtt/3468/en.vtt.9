00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.014
of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"?

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.522
That's an easy one --
"Slumdog Millionaire."

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.696
Three hundred seventy-seven
million worldwide,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.813
10 Oscar nominations and eight wins.

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:39.007
A chimpanzee tells his story

00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:41.738
of living with the legendary pop star
Michael Jackson.

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:43.735

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:47.817
But it is a script called "Bubbles,"

00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:50.014
that is going to be directed
by Taika Waititi,

00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:51.942
the director of "Thor: Ragnarok."

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:55.070
So, a large part of your job
as a development executive

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:58.291
is to separate the "Superstorms"
from the "Slumdog Millionaires,"

00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:01.591
and slightly more generally,
the writers who write "Superstorm"
