00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:01.591
and slightly more generally,
the writers who write "Superstorm"

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:04.231
from the writers who can write
"Slumdog Millionaire."

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.332
And the easiest way to do this, obviously,
is to read all of the scripts,

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:10.356
but that's, frankly, impossible.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.522
A good rule of thumb
is that the Writers Guild of America

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.347
registers about 50,000 new pieces
of material every year,

00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:18.125
and most of them are screenplays.

00:05:18.442 --> 00:05:21.537
Of those, a reasonable estimate
is about 5,000 of them

00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:24.693
make it through various filters,
agencies, management companies,

00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:26.641
screenplay compositions and the like,

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.959
and are read by someone
at the production company

00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:30.633
or major studio level.
