The funny thing is
that somewhere between then and now,

00:01:31.638 --> 00:01:34.085
I accidentally changed
part of the conversation

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.236
about which of those movies get made.

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:41.331
So, the story actually begins in 2005,
in an office high above Sunset Boulevard,

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:42.792
where I was a junior executive

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.760
at Leonardo DiCaprio's
production company Appian Way.

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:49.267
And for those of you who aren't familiar
with how the film industry works,

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.626
it basically means that I was
one of a few people behind the person

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.080
who produces the movie for the people
behind and in front of the camera,

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:58.839
whose names you will better
recognize than mine.

00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:02.578
Essentially, you're an assistant movie
producer who does the unglamorous work
