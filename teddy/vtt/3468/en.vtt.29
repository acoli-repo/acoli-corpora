00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:31.373
Simply put, the conventional wisdom
about screenwriting merit --

00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:34.960
where it was and where it could be found,

00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:36.349
was wrong.

00:14:36.373 --> 00:14:39.278
And this is notable,
because as I mentioned before,

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:42.577
in the triage of finding
movies to make and making them,

00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:45.450
there's a lot of relying
on conventional wisdom.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.141
And that conventional wisdom,

00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:50.347
maybe, just maybe,

00:14:50.371 --> 00:14:52.632
might be wrong
to even greater consequence.

00:14:53.688 --> 00:14:56.220
Films about black people
don't sell overseas.

00:14:57.117 --> 00:14:59.014
Female-driven action movies don't work,

00:14:59.038 --> 00:15:02.966
because women will see themselves in men,
but men won't see themselves in women.
