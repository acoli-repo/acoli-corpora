00:15:29.205 --> 00:15:32.450
and how we see the world
and for how the world sees us?

00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:37.807
We live in very strange times.

00:15:38.413 --> 00:15:42.200
And I think for the most part,
we all live in a state of constant triage.

00:15:42.224 --> 00:15:44.574
There's just too much information,

00:15:44.598 --> 00:15:46.664
too much stuff to contend with.

00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:50.495
And so as a rule, we tend
to default to conventional wisdom.

00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:54.811
And I think it's important
that we ask ourselves, constantly,

00:15:54.835 --> 00:15:59.582
how much of that conventional wisdom
is all convention and no wisdom?
