00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:02.028
who have already found their way
to living and working in Hollywood,

00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:04.743
who already have the best
representation in the business,

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.606
and are writing a very narrow
band of stories.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.581
And I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit,
that that's where I found myself in 2005.

00:07:12.634 --> 00:07:14.864
Sitting in that office
above Sunset Boulevard,

00:07:14.888 --> 00:07:17.896
staring down that metaphorical
anonymized bookstore,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.206
and having read nothing
but bad scripts for months.

00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:24.119
And I took this to mean one of two things:

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:26.547
either A: I was not very good at my job,

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.214
which was, ostensibly,
finding good scripts,

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:33.179
or B: reading bad scripts was the job.
