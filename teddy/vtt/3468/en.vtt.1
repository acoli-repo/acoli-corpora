00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.799
and the lights will go down
and they'll watch a movie.

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:35.506
They'll watch movies
about aliens or robots,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.887
or robot aliens or regular people.

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:42.416
But they will all be movies
about what it means to be human.

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:46.958
Millions will feel awe or fear,

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:49.782
millions will laugh and millions will cry.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.482
And then the lights will come back on,

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:55.688
and they'll reemerge into the world
they knew several hours prior.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.188
And millions of people
will look at the world

00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:01.189
a little bit differently
than they did when they went in.
