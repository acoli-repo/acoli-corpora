00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:02.578
Essentially, you're an assistant movie
producer who does the unglamorous work

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.363
that goes into the creative aspect
of producing a movie.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.149
You make lists of writers
and directors and actors

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:11.363
who might be right for movies
that you want to will into existence;

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:13.910
you meet with many of them
and their representatives,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.994
hoping to curry favor
for some future date.

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:18.386
And you read, a lot.

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:21.164
You read novels that might become movies,

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:23.363
you read comic books
that might become movies,

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:25.434
you read articles
that might become movies,

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:27.498
you read scripts that might become movies.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.656
And you read scripts from writers
that might write the adaptations
