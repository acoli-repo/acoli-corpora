It was very simply an opportunity
for people to speak their minds

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.155
about what they loved,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.172
which, in this world,
is increasingly rare.

00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:40.032
Now, almost all of the 75 people
I emailed anonymously responded.

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:43.149
And then two dozen other people
actually emailed to participate

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:44.735
to this anonymous email address,

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:48.307
but I confirmed that they did in fact
have the jobs they claimed to have.

00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:50.656
And I then compiled the votes
into a spreadsheet,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.704
ran a pivot table,
output it to PowerPoint,

00:08:52.728 --> 00:08:54.688
and the night before I left for vacation,

00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:56.617
I slapped a quasi subversive name on it

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.133
and emailed it back
from that anonymous email address

00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.474
to everyone who voted.
