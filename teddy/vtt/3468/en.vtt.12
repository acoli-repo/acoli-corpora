00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:01.895
And everyone has their method
to address these problems.

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.879
You know, most rely on the major agencies

00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:06.903
and they just assume
that if there's great talent in the world,

00:06:06.927 --> 00:06:09.172
they've already found
their way to the agencies,

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:11.879
regardless of the structural barriers
that actually exist

00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:13.991
to get into the agencies
in the first place.

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:16.545
Others also constantly compare
notes among themselves

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.559
about what they've read and what's good,

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:21.730
and they just hope that their cohort group
is the best, most wired

00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:23.982
and has the best taste in town.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:27.073
And others try to read everything,
but that's, again, impossible.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.667
If you're reading
500 screenplays in a year,

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.418
you are reading a lot.
