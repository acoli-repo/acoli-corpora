00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:01.958
Now, "Superstorm"
is certainly an extreme example,

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:04.125
but it's also not an unusual one.

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.718
And unfortunately, most scripts
aren't as easy to dismiss as that one.

00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:11.187
For example, a comedy
about a high school senior,

00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:13.349
who, when faced
with an unplanned pregnancy,

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.503
makes an unusual decision
regarding her unborn child.

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:18.053
That's obviously "Juno."

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:20.860
Two hundred and thirty million
at the worldwide box office,

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:23.017
four Oscar nominations, one win.

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.799
How about a Mumbai teen
who grew up in the slums

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:28.157
wants to become a contestant
on the Indian version

00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.014
of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"?
