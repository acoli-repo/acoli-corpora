00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:33.179
or B: reading bad scripts was the job.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.377
In which case, my mother's
weekly phone calls,

00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.451
asking me if my law school
entrance exam scores were still valid

00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:41.020
was something I should probably
pay more attention to.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.225
What I also knew

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:44.735
was that I was about to go
on vacation for two weeks,

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.500
and as bad as reading bad scripts is
when it is your job,

00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:49.246
it's even more painful on vacation.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.022
So I had to do something.

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:53.237
So late one night
at my office, I made a list

00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:56.493
of everyone that I had had breakfast,
lunch, dinner or drinks with

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:59.883
that had jobs similar to mine,
and I sent them an anonymous email.

00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:02.107
And I made a very simple request.
