00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:31.744
I stopped by the hotel's
business center to check my email.

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:33.894
This was a pre-iPhone world, after all.

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.641
And found that this list
that I had created anonymously

00:09:37.665 --> 00:09:40.117
had been forwarded back to me
several dozen times,

00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:41.642
at my personal email address.

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.515
Everyone was sharing this list of scripts
that everyone had said that they loved,

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:47.777
reading them and then
loving them themselves.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.474
And my first reaction,
that I can't actually say here,

00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:53.879
but will describe it as fear,

00:09:53.903 --> 00:09:56.157
the idea of surveying people
about their scripts

00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.615
was certainly not a novel or a genius one.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.982
Surely, there was some unwritten
Hollywood rule of omertà
