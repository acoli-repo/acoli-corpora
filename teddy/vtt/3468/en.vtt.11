00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:30.633
or major studio level.

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:33.125
And they're trying to decide
whether they can become

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.672
one of the 300-and-dropping movies
that are released by the major studios

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:38.387
or their sub-brands each year.

00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:39.583
I've described it before

00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:43.110
as being a little bit like walking
into a members-only bookstore

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.094
where the entire inventory
is just organized haphazardly,

00:05:46.118 --> 00:05:48.776
and every book has the same,
nondescript cover.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.411
Your job is to enter that bookstore

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:55.355
and not come back until you've found
the best and most profitable books there.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.712
It's anarchic and gleefully opaque.

00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:01.895
And everyone has their method
to address these problems.
