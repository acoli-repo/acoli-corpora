00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:02.107
And I made a very simple request.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.133
Send me a list of up to 10
of your favorite screenplays

00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:06.506
that meet three criteria.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.585
One: you love the screenplay,

00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:11.744
two: the filmed version of that screenplay
will not be in theaters

00:08:11.768 --> 00:08:13.403
by the end of that calendar year,

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:16.374
and three: you found out
about the screenplay this year.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:21.366
This was not an appeal for the scripts
that would be the next great blockbuster,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.323
not an appeal for the scripts
that will win the Academy Award,

00:08:24.347 --> 00:08:26.884
they didn't need to be scripts
that their bosses loved

00:08:26.884 --> 00:08:28.601
or that their studio wanted to make.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.687
It was very simply an opportunity
for people to speak their minds
