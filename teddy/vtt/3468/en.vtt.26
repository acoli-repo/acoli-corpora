They've been nominated
for 300 Academy Awards,

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.132
they've won 50.

00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:08.688
Four of the last nine Best Pictures
have gone to scripts from the Black List,

00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:12.513
and 10 of the last 20 screenplay Oscars
have gone to scripts from the Black List.

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:15.141
All told, they've made
about 25 billion dollars

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:16.750
in worldwide box office,

00:13:16.774 --> 00:13:19.473
which means that hundreds
of millions of people

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:21.925
have seen these films
when they leave their homes,

00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:25.194
and sit next to someone they don't know
and the lights go down.

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.643
And that's to say nothing
of post-theatrical environments

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:31.516
like DVD, streaming and,
let's be honest, illegal downloads.
