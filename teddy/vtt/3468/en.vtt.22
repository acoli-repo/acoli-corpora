00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.925
and decided to never make again,

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:02.615
to sell his client to me.

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:04.782
To suggest that the script had merit,

00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:08.778
based solely on the possibility of being
included on a list of beloved screenplays.

00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.046
After the call ended, I sat in my office,
sort of staring out the window,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.986
alternating between shock
and general giddiness.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.593
And then I realized that this thing
that I had created

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:19.791
had a lot more value

00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:22.840
than just me finding good screenplays
to read over the holidays.

00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:25.069
And so I did it again the next year --

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:28.268
and the "LA Times" had outed me
as the person who had created it --

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:29.561
and the year after that,

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:33.052
and the year after that --
I've done it every year since 2005.
