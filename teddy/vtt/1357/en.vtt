00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, my question:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
are we alone?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The story of humans is the story of ideas --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
ideas that have vanished in history,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and ideas that have been set in dogma.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a story of nations,
