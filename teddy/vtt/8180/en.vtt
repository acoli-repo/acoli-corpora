We're going to be talking
about your directorial feature debut

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:11.299

I can't wait to hear
all about that process

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.263

when you were younger in Afghanistan,

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.062
what it was like growing up?

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:27.607
