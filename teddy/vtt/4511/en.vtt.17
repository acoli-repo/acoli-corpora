00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
it's a very dark story and it's a story

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
if we listen to the locals who understand

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
what's going on in these kinds of situations.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And what it ended up doing is making the idea

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.
