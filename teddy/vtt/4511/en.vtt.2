00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.
