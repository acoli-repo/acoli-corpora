00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And he thought about representing that

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but eventually he hit upon the idea

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that what he needed was something that you could see.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And so he created this map,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
as black bars at each address.
