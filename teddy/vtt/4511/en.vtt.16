00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the authorities slowly started to come around.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And they had already started building the sewers in London,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and they immediately went to this outbreak

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and they told everybody to start boiling their water.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,
