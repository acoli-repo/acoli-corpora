00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and -- oh right, we drink from the river.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So what ended up happening, actually,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively
