00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
who was a local doctor in Soho in London,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
who had been arguing for about four or five years

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and had basically convinced nobody of this.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but nothing had really stuck.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.
