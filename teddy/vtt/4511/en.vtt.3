00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and hope that it would somehow go away,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and of course it never really would go away.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
until literally their milk ran out and they died,
