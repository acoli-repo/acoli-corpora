We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
quite the way that, you know, Rome did,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.
