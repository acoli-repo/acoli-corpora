00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
erupted about two or three days later.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and much more would have died if people hadn't fled

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
after the initial outbreak kicked in.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So it was this incredibly terrifying event.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You had these scenes of entire families dying

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
over the course of 48 hours of cholera,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,
