And cholera was really the great killer of this period.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and throughout the U.K.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We had to get rid of the smell.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
founding public-health interventions in the system of the city,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
one of which was called the "Nuisances Act,"

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
which they got everybody as far as they could

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
