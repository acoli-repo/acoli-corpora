00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:10.133
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.603
nearly fourteen billion
years ago,

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:15.083
and has been expanding 
ever since.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.533
But what is it expanding into?

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.186
That's a complicated question.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.166
Here's why:

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.416
Einstein's equations of
general relativity

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:29.416
describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:31.176
fabric for the universe.
