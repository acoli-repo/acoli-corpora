00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:06.138
and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes.

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:09.751
Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane,

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:16.521
floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace.

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:22.491
Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace,

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:27.371
and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.431
Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse,
