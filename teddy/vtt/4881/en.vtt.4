The universe is expanding 
unto itself.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:06.157
That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:11.187
to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime.

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:15.722
These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:18.622
kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:23.802
The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe,

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:28.322
as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be?
