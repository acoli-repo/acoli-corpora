00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:32.036
of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other,

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:37.222
and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.332
distance than the nearby ones

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.542
in the same amount of time.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:46.812
Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic

00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:49.977
tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:54.097
It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out,

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:55.827
and space stretches.

00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.117
So there's our answer.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.007
The universe is expanding 
unto itself.
