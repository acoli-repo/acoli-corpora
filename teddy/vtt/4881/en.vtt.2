00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:00.786
His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.686
recede, or move away,
from the Earth.

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:08.246
Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes.

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:10.666
How can we interpret this?

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.726
Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.006
The batter rises by the same
amount in between each

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.236
and every raisin.

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:22.736
If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies,

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.066
and batter as the space
between them,

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.036
we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:32.036
of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other,
