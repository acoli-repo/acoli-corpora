00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:04.551
As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models.

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:09.261
While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments,

00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:13.601
there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet.

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.971
Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along,

00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:20.881
scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models…

00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:27.341
and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.
