00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:32.122
The inflationary model 
describes a brief era

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.388
of incredibly rapid expansion

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:38.028
that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe,

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:42.538
to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:47.318
If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:53.578
one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation.

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:57.088
We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality,

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:01.088
save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion
