00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:31.818
for us to encounter a neighbor universe.

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:37.378
The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.758
may unify into one super-force.

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:44.758
Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification,

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:49.248
in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons.

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:54.908
In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe.

00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:59.788
Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description,

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:06.138
and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes.
