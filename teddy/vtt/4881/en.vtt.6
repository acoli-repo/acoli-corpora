00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:01.088
save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:04.858
may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state.

00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:09.358
In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random

00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:15.348
chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes.

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:18.158
Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.718
—would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.098
Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse,

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.338
in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:31.818
for us to encounter a neighbor universe.
