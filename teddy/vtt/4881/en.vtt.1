fabric for the universe.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.176
This means that what we know of
as space and time

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.616
exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:42.656
Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:43.986
into more space.

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:47.986
But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into,

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:50.536
what does expanding 
even mean?

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:54.536
In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.116
gave us a definitive answer.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:00.786
His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies
