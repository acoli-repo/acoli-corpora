Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse,

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:37.511
but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.001
An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.971
—a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era.

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:50.771
So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo.

00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:57.231
Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description,

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.871
or be replaced by something else.

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:04.551
As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models.
