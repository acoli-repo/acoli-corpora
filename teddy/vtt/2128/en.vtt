The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to presenting great American lives,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
amazing people.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And that's what it's about.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I started to worry about the fact

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,
