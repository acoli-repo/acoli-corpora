00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and paused, you gave him the word,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and by the end of it,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I didn't know what was going on,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
or empathy, at any rate,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is what's critical to this kind of interview.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But then I began to think of other things.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Who makes a great interview in this context?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It had nothing to do with their intellect,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the quality of their intellect.
