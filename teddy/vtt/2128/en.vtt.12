He subsequently got married again at 102,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But after the interview, I got a call,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
very gruff voice, from a woman.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I didn't know who she was,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and I could never do it."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then she made me go up with the tape of it

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
