00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
what you try to find out about them,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, I had two preconditions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
One was that they be American.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's created to look at American lives.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That was easy, but then I made the decision,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe arbitrary,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that they needed to be people of a certain age,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which at that point, when I created this program,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
seemed really old.
