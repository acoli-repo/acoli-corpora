00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which at that point, when I created this program,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
seemed really old.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And why did I do that?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I thought really what we need is an elders program

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the more convinced I am that that's true.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's amazing what people will say when they know

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
how the story turned out.
