00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Didn't matter." Whatever.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Awful.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
