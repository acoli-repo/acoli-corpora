00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
creating the life narrative that we inherited.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So, I thought okay, now,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what is it going to take to make this work?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
There are the journalist interviews,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which are the interrogation that is expected.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is somewhat against resistance

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Then there's the celebrity interview,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
as Nixon in that process.
