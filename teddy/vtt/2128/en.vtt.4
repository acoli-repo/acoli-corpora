00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
how the story turned out.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's the one advantage that older people have.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but they also have some disadvantages,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but the one thing they or we have is that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we've reached the point in life

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where we know how the story turned out.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, we can then go back in our lives,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and begin to reflect on how we got there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
All of those accidents that wound up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
creating the life narrative that we inherited.
