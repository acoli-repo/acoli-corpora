00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and by the way, at one point I asked him,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
"Would you like to have met him?"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And he said, "Well, of course,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
because I got to read all of his letters."

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And I asked him one question.
