00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
was George Abbott, who was 97,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and Abbott was filled with the life force --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And so he filled the room,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and we had an extraordinary conversation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because he was famous for being silent,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
for never ever saying anything

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
except maybe a word or two.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
He subsequently got married again at 102,
