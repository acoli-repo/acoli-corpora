00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They have to think that they did something

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and that they want to share it with you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But it comes down, in the end,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
All of us are public and private beings,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
there's no point in it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and we all have infomercials about our lives.
