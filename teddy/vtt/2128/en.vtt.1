00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I started to worry about the fact

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and they're amazing people,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we want to deliver them to future generations.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, how do we do that?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
my being a brush in the hand

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the great hits of that program,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
as to give you this whole notion

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
