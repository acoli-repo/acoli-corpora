00:00:01.246 --> 00:00:04.830
Computers used to be as big as a room.

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:06.446
But now they fit in your pocket,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.641
on your wrist

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.984
and can even be implanted
inside of your body.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:12.289
How cool is that?

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.146
And this has been enabled
by the miniaturization of transistors,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.662
which are the tiny switches
in the circuits

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.462
at the heart of our computers.

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.223
And it's been achieved
through decades of development

00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:28.045
and breakthroughs
in science and engineering

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.741
and of billions of dollars of investment.
