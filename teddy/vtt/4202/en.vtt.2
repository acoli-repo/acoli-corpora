This is my name … I am
from Mumbai … married … work in advertising.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.256
This is one of your stories.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.936
All of us have several
such stories in our mind.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.736
Stories about us 
that we tell others and ourselves.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.900
Stories that start
with our earliest memories

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.400
and with imagination
reach into our future.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.896
The protagonist of these stories,
that is we,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.416
don’t change,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.256
whether we are in our childhood
or days to come in the future.
