AA: So Gautama Buddha was telling
us this 2,500 years ago,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.135
but people didn't believe.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.309
It’s difficult.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.620
I agree with you,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.770
this is not easy to live this idea.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.736
One has to think
and meditate over this idea.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.296
And whenever given a chance,
put it into practice.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.020
So in our societies 
there are many practices

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.040
that allows you to let go of yourselves


00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.040
to understand that 
this is a temporary thing
