Shah Rukh Khan: I am happy.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.376
I am unhappy,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.776
I am happy.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.576
I am unhappy,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.896
In this dilemma,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.816
“I” plays an important role.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.800
Which is why it’s important 
to understand oneself

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800
to know why you are happy or unhappy.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.576

what has been studied in depth

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.296

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.016

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.696
And today he is here to tell us
how to make this "self" happy.
