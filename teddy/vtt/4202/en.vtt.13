SRK: Thank you very much Anil.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.537
You shared some wonderful things
with us today.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:40.136
Maybe five minutes is very little time
to understand this completely

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.016
and to feel why this does this happen.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.296
It’s a little involved as a topic.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.136
I’ll share the little I understood.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.656
The way we think of ourselves
as permanent,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.776
whether our thoughts
or our feelings or physicality,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.336
physicality we all know is not permanent

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.200
but the thought that 
is it actually present
