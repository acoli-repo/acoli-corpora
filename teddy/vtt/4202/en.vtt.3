whether we are in our childhood
or days to come in the future.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.216
But we are not just a story,
we are also a body

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.976
that is present here at this moment,
letting us feel the environment around us.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.646
Right now you, all can see me,
hear my voice

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:48.430
but not for once will you feel

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.630
that what your eyes are seeing 
is being watched by someone else

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:56.614
and what your ears are hearing,
is being listened to by someone else.

00:01:56.638 --> 00:02:02.416
You, in fact all of us, can only believe
in the existence of one thing in us.
