00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.656
people suffering from mental state
like Schizophrenia

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.376
tend to believe that sometimes

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.696
the thoughts arising in their mind
are not their own thought.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.416
Usually we consider the thought
arising in our mind as our own

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.616
but schizophrenia tells us that

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.696
the thoughts we think are our own,
are also an illusion of the mind.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.482
So we have circled around 
and come back to the same thing.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.096
So what is this “I”

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.456
that’s sometimes aware
of its story, sometimes not?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.616
That sometimes feels
the parts of its bodies,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.976
whether that part exists or not.
