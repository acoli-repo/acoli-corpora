Who is it or rather what is it
that is experiencing this sadness?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.256
Do these questions help
in easing our suffering?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.696
According to religion and philosophy, 
to understand pain,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.696
one has to understand oneself.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.276
It’s important to realize
that we are not permanent.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.296
To understand this better, we now
have help from neuroscience, too.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.616
An example of this would be Alzheimer’s,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.216
which is the disease of forgetting things.
