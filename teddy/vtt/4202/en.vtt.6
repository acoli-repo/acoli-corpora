which is the disease of forgetting things.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.096
In the initial stages, Alzheimer’s
destroys the short-term memory.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.690
People forget moments they just spent

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.740
and slowly this disease starts 
eating up their old memories too.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.096
People start forgetting their loved ones
and even themselves.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.856
From Alzheimer’s we can conclude that
this story that we keep telling ourselves,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.026
which is called "narrative self"
or "autobiographical self" in neuroscience,

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:29.926
is a creation of the mind.
