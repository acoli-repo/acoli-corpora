00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:32.040
the self is an all-encompassing
consciousness

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.604
that feels everything in the world.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.576
So where there is nothing,
to believe in one permanent self

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.220
or to believe in 
an all-encompassing consciousness,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.160
this is where we are going wrong.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.136
Neuroscience, too, is trying
to tell us the same thing

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.816
that the permanent self we feel
is the work of the body and mind.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.296
If we understand and imbibe
this philosophy in life,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.656
then maybe we can reduce
our pain and suffering.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.016
A lot of wrong in the society
is the result of this permanent self.
