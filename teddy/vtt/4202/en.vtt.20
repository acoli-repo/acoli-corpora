00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.620
But yes, Anil shared
a very wise thing with us today

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.660
The quest for permanence ...

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.770
is perhaps one of the biggest reason
for unhappiness

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.120
What we have today
may not be there tomorrow,

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:15.410
and what gives us happiness tomorrow
may not give day after tomorrow.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.930
So if we all understand this,

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.670
all you guys are very young here
to take this cynically.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.907
So take this positively,

00:10:20.907 --> 00:10:24.520
then your life will be full of happiness
or else do pottery like Anil said.

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:28.675
Let's share it for Anil Ananthaswamy
Thank you for being here.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.795
