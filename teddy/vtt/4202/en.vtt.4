You, in fact all of us, can only believe
in the existence of one thing in us.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.136
So we are a body present here
at this moment,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.600
and we are also a person
who was like this in the childhood

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
and will hopefully continue to be so.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.056
If the answer to, “Who am I?” is so easy,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.136
why do we even ask such questions?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.096
When we are suffering
with pain and sadness,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.416
we are forced to think over
such questions.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.496
Who is it or rather what is it
that is experiencing this sadness?
