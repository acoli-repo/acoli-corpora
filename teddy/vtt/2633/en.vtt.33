EH: I want to talk about --

00:16:30.264 --> 00:16:31.564
NL: Well, then do it.

00:16:31.588 --> 00:16:36.398
(Laughter)

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.468
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,

00:16:40.492 --> 00:16:42.428
but you've also built a life of meaning.

00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:45.381
And all of us strive to do
both of those things --

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:46.999
not all of us manage to.

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:51.755
But even those of us who do manage
to accomplish both of those,

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:54.349
very rarely do we figure out
how to do them together.

00:16:54.884 --> 00:16:59.764
You managed to push culture
forward through your art

00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:03.646
while also achieving world-beating
commercial success.
