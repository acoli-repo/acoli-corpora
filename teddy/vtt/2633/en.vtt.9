00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:31.794
the greatest of the foreign
correspondents,

00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:32.989
Paddy Chayefsky --

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:35.775
I think the best writer
that ever came out of television --

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.776
Milton Berle, Lucille Ball

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.181
and me.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:40.356
EH: Not bad.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.095
NL: I call my mother
immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:44.642
"Mom, this is what's happened,

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.265
they're starting a hall of fame."

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.012
I tell her the list of names and me,

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:49.194
and she says,

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:51.955
"Listen, if that's what they
want to do, who am I to say?"

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.480
(Laughter)

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:58.420
(Applause)

00:04:58.444 --> 00:04:59.801
That's my Ma.

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.705
I think it earns that kind of a laugh
