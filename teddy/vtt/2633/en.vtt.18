00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.182
another horse's ass --

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.797
who was very vocal
about hating the New Deal

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.284
and Roosevelt and Jews.

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:09.589
The first time I ran into an understanding

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:12.506
that there were people
in this world that hated me

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.466
because I was born to Jewish parents.

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:19.418
And that had an enormous
effect on my life.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.042
EH: So you had a childhood

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:25.148
with little in the way
of strong male role models,

00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:26.708
except for your grandfather.

00:09:27.272 --> 00:09:29.152
Tell us about him.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.326
NL: Oh, my grandfather.
