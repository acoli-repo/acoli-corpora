(Laughter)

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.947
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.376
Your father was a con man --
I got that right.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.147
He was taken away to prison
when you were nine years old.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.328
You flew 52 missions
as a fighter pilot in World War II.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:42.836
You came back to --

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.017
Your breakthrough, your debut,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.309
was a little show
called "All in the Family."

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.437
You followed that up with a string of hits

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.579
