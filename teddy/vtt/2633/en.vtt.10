00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.825
because everybody
has a piece of that mother.

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.023

EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother
is born, right there.

00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:13.158
So your father also played
a large role in your life,

00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:14.832

00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:28.064
"I don't want you to have
anything to do with them,

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:29.341
I don't trust those men."
