00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.579
that to this day is unmatched
in Hollywood:

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.643
"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.493
"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:05.930
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:07.717
to name literally a fraction of them.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.518
Not only are they all commercially --

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.548
(Applause)

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.557
Not only are they all
commercially successful,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:18.555
but many of them push our culture forward

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.941
by giving the underrepresented
members of society

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:23.001
their first prime-time voice.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.644
You have seven shows
in the top 10 at one time.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.262
At one point,

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:31.623
you aggregate an audience
of 120 million people per week
