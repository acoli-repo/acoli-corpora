00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:30.331
I did a reasonable amount of crying,

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:34.188
and I realized how much
I needed the father.

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:38.440
So much so that I appropriated
Arthur Marshall's grandfather.

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:42.012
So much so, the word "father" --

00:12:42.573 --> 00:12:44.518
I have six kids by the way.

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:46.980
My favorite role in life.

00:12:49.482 --> 00:12:51.958
It and husband to my wife Lyn.

00:12:55.972 --> 00:13:00.453
But I stole the man's identity
because I needed the father.
