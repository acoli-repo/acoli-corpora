Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman
doesn't need much of an introduction,

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.054
but TED's audience is global,

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:07.275
it's diverse,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.285
so I've been tasked
with starting with his bio,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.595
which could easily take up
the entire 18 minutes.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.562
So instead we're going to do
93 years in 93 seconds or less.

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:17.736
(Laughter)

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:19.805
You were born in New Hampshire.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.544
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:22.854
EH: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:25.766
(Laughter)

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.410
NL: There goes seven more seconds.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:28.677
EH: Nailed it.

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.691
(Laughter)
