00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.540
(Laughter)

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.286
This really sums up my mother.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.881
They were love letters,

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:17.107
as if I had written them to --

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.428
they were love letters.

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:25.747
A year later I asked my mother
if I could have them,

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:30.048
because I'd like to keep them
all the years of my life ...
