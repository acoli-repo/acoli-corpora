00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.390
That's when I heard,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.897
maybe not for the first time,

00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:36.587
"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."

00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.088
And he went.

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:43.129
It turns out he was picking up
some fake bonds,

00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:46.676
which he was flying
across the country to sell.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.311
But the fact that he was going
to Oklahoma in a plane,

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:55.026
and he was going to bring me
back a 10-gallon hat,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.748
just like Ken Maynard,
my favorite cowboy wore.
