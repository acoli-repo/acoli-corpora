00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.326
NL: Oh, my grandfather.

00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:35.784
Well here's the way I always
talked about that grandfather.

00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:38.756
There were parades,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.661
lots of parades when I was a kid.

00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:42.597
There were parades on Veteran's Day --

00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:44.189
there wasn't a President's Day.

00:09:44.213 --> 00:09:46.126
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.254
George Washington's birthday

00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:50.768
and Flag Day ...

00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:53.580
And lots of little parades.

00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:55.033
My grandfather used to take me

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:56.783
and we'd stand on the street corner,

00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:58.143
he'd hold my hand,

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:01.230
and I'd look up and I'd see a tear
running down his eye.
