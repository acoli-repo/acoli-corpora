00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:02.202
And I think that was the moment

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:06.336
I began to understand the foolishness
of the human condition.

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:09.836
So ...

00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:15.138
it took a lot of years to look back at it
and feel it was a benefit.

00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:17.587
But --

00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:19.879
EH: It's interesting
you call it a benefit.

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:22.334
NL: Benefit in that it gave
me that springboard.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:26.138
I mean that I could think

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.350
how foolish it was to say
to this crying nine-year-old boy,

00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.279
"You're the man of the house now."
