00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:02.018
"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.215
"This Is Spinal Tap."

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.376
(Applause)

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.932
Again, just to name a fraction.

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:06.987
(Applause)

00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.517
Then you wipe the slate clean,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.588
start a third act as a political activist
focusing on protecting the First Amendment

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.562
and the separation of church and state.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.476
You start People For The American Way.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.358
You buy the Declaration of Independence

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:19.873
and give it back to the people.

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:22.235
You stay active in both
entertainment and politics

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.791
until the ripe old of age of 93,

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:25.061
when you write a book

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:27.249
and make a documentary
about your life story.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:28.447
And after all that,

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.013
they finally think
you're ready for a TED Talk.
