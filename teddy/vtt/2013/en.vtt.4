00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.638
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:05.970
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.684
We could call it cluefulness.

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:11.245
It's a certain kind of test:

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.037
Can you recognize

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.541
an underlying threat and respond?

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.031
Can you save yourself or save your kind?

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:20.770
Turns out ants are pretty good at this.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.853
Cows, not so much.

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:25.283
So can you see the pattern?

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.630
Can you see a pattern and then recognize

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.682
and do something about it? Number two.
