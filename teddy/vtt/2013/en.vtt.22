00:10:57.632 --> 00:11:01.352
with analysts and political experts

00:11:01.352 --> 00:11:04.684
to calculate, how much would it cost

00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:07.106
to win enough votes in the United States Congress

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:08.926
to make fundamental reform possible?

00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:11.728
What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:13.568
What is that number?

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:16.333
And then whatever that number is,

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.438
we are going to kickstart, sort of,

00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:20.369
because you can't use KickStarter for political work,

00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:23.140
but anyway, kickstart, sort of,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.496
first a bottom-up campaign

00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:28.476
where people will make small dollar commitments

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:31.438
contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,
