00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.682
and do something about it? Number two.

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:33.609
Number three, a boy.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.910
This is my friend Aaron Swartz.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.341
He's Tim's friend.

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.373
He's friends of many of you in this audience,

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:40.798

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:46.367
It was just before I was going
to give my first TED Talk.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:48.790
I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.297
"Laws that choke creativity."

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:52.906
And Aaron looked at me

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.857
and was a little impatient, and he said,

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:58.950
"So how are you ever

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.990
going to solve the problems you're talking about?
