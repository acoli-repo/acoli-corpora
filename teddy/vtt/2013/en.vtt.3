00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:31.694
calculations.

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:34.297
Number two, a poet.

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:36.577
This is Martin Niemöller.

00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:38.110
You're familiar with his poetry.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.886
Around the height of the Nazi period,

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:42.158
he started repeating the verse,

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:43.893
"First they came for the communists,

00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:45.424
and I did nothing,

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:47.674
did not speak out because I was not a communist.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.728
Then they came for the socialists.

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:50.690
Then they came for the trade unions.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.936
Then they came for the Jews.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.838
And then they came for me.

00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:59.509
But there was no one left to speak for me."

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.638
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.
