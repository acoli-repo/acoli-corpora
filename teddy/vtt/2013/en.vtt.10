00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.417
But after the buzz, the excitement,

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:05.892
the power that comes from this community,

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.443
I began to yearn for a less sterile,

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:10.960
less academic way to address these issues,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.749
the issues that I was talking about.

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.605
We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:19.273
as a target for this political movement,

00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:21.810
because the primary in New Hampshire

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.600
is so incredibly important.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.201
It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.519
that was beginning to talk about, how would we make

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.769
this issue of this corruption central in 2016?
