00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.609
Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:34.859
that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:38.499
It is now an official word in the dictionary.

00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:43.894
So on May 1, aka May Day,

00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.681
we're going to try an experiment.

00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:48.498
We're going to try a launching

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:50.796
of what we can think of as a Super PAC

00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:54.060
to end all Super PACs.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.860
And the basic way this works is this.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.632
For the last year, we have been working

00:10:57.632 --> 00:11:01.352
with analysts and political experts
