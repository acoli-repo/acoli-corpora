00:11:58.508 --> 00:12:01.200
on November 8,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.739
we will celebrate 218 representatives

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:06.826
in the House and 60 Senators

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.847
in the United States Senate

00:12:08.847 --> 00:12:11.140
who have committed to this idea

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.006
of fundamental reform.

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:16.768
So last night, we heard about wishes.

00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:18.856

00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:22.100
May one.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.483
May the ideals of one boy

00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:29.964
unite one nation behind one critical idea

00:12:29.964 --> 00:12:32.425
that we are one people,
