00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.479
that meant that there was a certain probability

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.487
that the result of the calculation would be an error,

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.080
and the probability was one out of every

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.617
360 billion calculations.

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:42.611
So Intel said your average spreadsheet

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:47.117
would be flawed once every 27,000 years.

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:48.411
They didn't think it was significant,

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.637
but there was an outrage in the community.

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:53.987
The community, the techies, said, this flaw

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.068
has to be addressed.

00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:57.069
They were not going to stand by quietly

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.017
as Intel gave them these chips.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.063
So there was a revolution across the world.
