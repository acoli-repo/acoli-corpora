00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:06.520
So a chip, a poet and a boy.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.485
It's just about 20 years ago,

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:11.989
June 1994, when Intel announced

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.002
that there was a flaw

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.819
at the core of their Pentium chip.

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.200
Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.451
to calculate intermediate quotients necessary

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.285
for iterative floating points of divisions --

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:26.384
I don't know what that means, but 
it's what it says on Wikipedia â€”

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.263
there was a flaw and an error

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.479
that meant that there was a certain probability
