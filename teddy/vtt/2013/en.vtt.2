00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.063
So there was a revolution across the world.

00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:04.093
People marched to demand --

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.202
okay, not really exactly like that —

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.943
but they rose up and they demanded

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.935
that Intel fix the flaw.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:17.787
And Intel set aside 475 million dollars

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:20.029
to fund the replacement of millions of chips

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:21.120
to fix the flaw.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.332
So billions of dollars in our society

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:25.516
was spent to address a problem

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:29.607
which would come once out of every 360 billion

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:31.694
calculations.
