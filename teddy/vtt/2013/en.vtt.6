00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.990
going to solve the problems you're talking about?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.792
Copyright policy, Internet policy,

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.982
how are you ever going to address those problems

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:09.215
so long as there's this fundamental corruption

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:12.060
in the way our government works?"

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.665
So I was a little put off by this.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.650
He wasn't sharing in my celebration.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.817
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:20.911
it's not my field, not my field."

00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:23.467
He said, "You mean as an
academic, it's not your field?"

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.061
I said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:29.392
He said, "What about as a citizen?

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:32.819
As a citizen."
