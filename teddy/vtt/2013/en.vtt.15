00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:30.703
Now politicians and pundits tell you,

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:32.523
there's nothing we can do about this issue,

00:07:32.523 --> 00:07:33.859
Americans don't care about it,

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:36.155
but the reason for that is

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.009
that 91 percent of Americans

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.531
think there's nothing that can
be done about this issue.

00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:45.353
And it's this gap between 96 and 91

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:47.830
that explains our politics of resignation.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.913
I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.775
wish we could fly like Superman,

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:54.939
but because at least 91 percent
of us believe we can't,

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.605
we don't leap off of tall buildings every time

00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:58.915
we have that urge.

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.921
That's because we accept our limits,
