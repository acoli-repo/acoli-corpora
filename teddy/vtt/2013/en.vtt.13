00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.110
but the question I asked,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.658
could we remix Granny D a bit?

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:35.790
What about a walk not of 3,200 miles

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.710
but of 185 miles across New Hampshire

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.314
in January?

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:45.540
So on January 11,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.426
the anniversary of Aaron's death,

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:52.169
we began a walk that ended on January 24th,

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.515
the day that Granny D was born.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:01.095
A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,
