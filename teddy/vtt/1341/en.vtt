00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let me just start with my story.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
playing soccer in college.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then developed an arthritic knee.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and, by the way, I married a woman

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who has exactly the same story.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
