Hi everyone.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.440
So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.176
I'd just spent about six months
working on album

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.256
that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.496
and it was getting about three plays
per day on Myspace at the time,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.536
and I was getting more and more depressed
when I started noticing these other people

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.256
who were playing guitar and singing

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.696
and putting videos
on this new site called YouTube,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.456
and they were getting 300,000 views.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.576
So I decided I'm going to start
making some Youtube videos.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.816
And one day they featured
a video of my band on the homepage,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.095
which was amazing --
we got a bunch of new fans.
