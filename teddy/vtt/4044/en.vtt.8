00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.776
and iTunes and Google search,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.856
and a hundred years of infrastructure

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.456
and supply chains and distribution systems

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.296
and monetization schemes

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.216
are completely bypassed --

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.440
in a decade.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.376
After 100 years of designing these things,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.296
it's no wonder that it's just totally

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.936
It's no wonder that the monetization
part of the chain doesn't work

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.480
given this new context.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.176
But what gets me super excited
to be a creator right now,
