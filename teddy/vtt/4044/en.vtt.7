00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.256
humans built just billions and billions
of dollars of infrastructure

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.536
to essentially help artists do two things.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.616
First, put their art on a thing,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.856
and second, get that thing
around the world

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.496
to the people who wanted the art.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.336
So, so much industry
is devoted to these two problems.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.313
Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:50.016
and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms,
and CD jewel case manufacturers,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.040
all devoted to these two problems.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.176
And then we all know what happened.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.856
10 years ago, the internet matures

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.936
and we get Spotify
and Facebook and YouTube

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.776
and iTunes and Google search,
