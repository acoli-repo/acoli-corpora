WEBVTT

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.736
within a few weeks, they were
making 31,000 dollars per month

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.256
for this show.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.376
It took off so fast that they decided
to expand their programming

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.656
and add new shows,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.336
and now they launched
a second Patreon page --

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.480
they're making an additional
21,000 dollars per month.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.840
And they're scaling what's essentially
becoming a media company,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.920
financing the whole thing
through membership.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.136
OK, here's another example.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.496
This is Derek Bodner,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.496
a sports journalist who used
to write for Philadelphia Magazine
