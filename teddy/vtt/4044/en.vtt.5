00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.640
This is 20,000 people.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.296
Like, in what world is this not enough?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.256
I don't understand.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.896
What systems have we built
where this is insufficient

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.400
for a person to make a living?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.896
So, I actually have a theory about this.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.656
I think it's been a weird 100 years.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.896

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.896
About 100 years ago,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.496
humans figured out how to record
sound onto a wax cylinder.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.496
That was the beginning of the phonograph.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.856
Right around the same time,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.176
we figured out how to record
light onto a piece of photographic paper,
