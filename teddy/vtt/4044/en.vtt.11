For a creator, it's like having a salary
for being a creative person.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.056
And this is one of our creators.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.496
They're called "Kinda Funny."

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.776
They have about 220,000
subscribers on YouTube.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.216
And when they upload a video,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.016
it gets somewhere around
15,000 views to 100,000 views.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.016
I want you to check yourselves right now.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.256
I think when we hear numbers like that,
when we hear "15,000 views,"

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.696
and we see content like this,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.896
we just snap categorize it
as being not as legitimate

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.896
as a morning show
that you'd hear on the radio

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.296
or a talk show that you'd
see on NBC or something

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.456
But when "Kinda Funny"
launched on Patreon,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.736
within a few weeks, they were
making 31,000 dollars per month
