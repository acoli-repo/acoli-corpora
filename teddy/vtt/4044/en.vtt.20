It's not there yet,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600
but in a couple years,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.576
there will be so many systems
and tools for them

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.576
to just make a living online,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.896
and if they've got a podcast
that's starting to take off,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.056
but they're not able
to make money on it yet,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.296
that's happening

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.736
and they're going to be paid.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.960
It's happening.
