00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.616
even the people who were
uploading videos to the internet.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.336
And so for the next four years,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.176
I uploaded more and more
videos to the Internet,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.736
and they got better and better,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.936
and we made enough money
through brand deals

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.496
and commercials and iTunes sales

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.336
to buy a house.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.656
And we built a recording studio.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.336
But there was one big problem:

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.456
making money as a creative person
in 2013 was super weird.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.376
First of all, the business models
were changing all the time.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.176
So our 58,000 dollars
of annual iTunes download income
