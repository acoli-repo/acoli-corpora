00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.176
we figured out how to record
light onto a piece of photographic paper,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.576
celluloid -- the beginning
of film and television.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.296
For the first time,
you could store art on a thing,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.576
which was amazing.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.336
Art used to be completely ephemeral,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.816
so if you missed the symphony,
you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.256
But now, for the first time,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.856
you could store the orchestra's
performance on a physical object,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.376
and like, listen to it later,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.136
which was amazing.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.416
It was so amazing in fact,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.736
that for the next 100 years,
between 1900 and 2000,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.256
humans built just billions and billions
of dollars of infrastructure
