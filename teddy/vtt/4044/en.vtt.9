00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.176
But what gets me super excited
to be a creator right now,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.136
to be alive today and be
a creative person right now,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.336
is realizing that we're only 10 years
into figuring out this new machine --

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.376
to figuring out the next 100 years
of infrastructure for our creators.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.336
And you can tell we're only 10 years in.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.456
There's a lot of trial and error,
some really good ideas forming,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.736
a lot of experimentation.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.976
We're figuring out
what works and what doesn't.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.136
Like Twitch streamers.
Who's heard of Twitch?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.576
Twitch streamers are making
three to five thousand bucks a month

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.856
streaming gaming content.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.160
The big ones are making
over 100,000 dollars a year.
