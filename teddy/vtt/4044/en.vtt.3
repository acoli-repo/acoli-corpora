00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.176
So our 58,000 dollars
of annual iTunes download income

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.856
was about to be replaced by about
6,000 dollars of streaming income.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.776
Steams paid less than downloads.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.856
And then as more and more creators
started popping up online,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.976
there was just more competition
for these five-figure brand deals

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.136
that had kept the band afloat for years.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.376
And to top it all off,
our videos themselves --

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.216
the creative stuff that we made
that our fans loved and appreciated --

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.696
that were actually
contributing value to the world,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.856
those videos were generating
almost zero dollars of income for us.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.256
This is an actual snapshot
of my YouTube dashboard

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.536
from a 28-day period
