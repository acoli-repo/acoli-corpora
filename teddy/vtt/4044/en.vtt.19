00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.016
Creators are going to come out
the other end of this weird 100 years,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.560
this century-long journey,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.280
with an awesome new machine.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.720
And they're going to be paid,
and they're going to be valued.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.976
Thanks, everybody.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.160
(Applause)

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.480
I think it went pretty well.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.136
I want artists who saw that
to not give up --

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.696
to know that we're getting there.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.336
It's not there yet,
