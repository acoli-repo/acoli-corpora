The big ones are making
over 100,000 dollars a year.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.976
There's a site called YouNow,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.216
it's an app.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.016
It allows musicians and vloggers
to get paid in digital goods from fans.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.776
So, I'm also working on the problem.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.136
Four years ago I started
a company called Patreon

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.416
with a friend of mine.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.840
We're 80 people now
working on this problem.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.696
It's basically a membership platform

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.936
that makes it really easy
for creators to get paid --

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.176
every month from their fans
to earn a living.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.456
For a creator, it's like having a salary
for being a creative person.
