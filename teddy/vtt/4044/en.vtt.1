WEBVTT

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.095
which was amazing --
we got a bunch of new fans.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.536
We also got a bunch of people

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.536
who, I guess, just didn't really like
the music or something --

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.576
(Laughter)

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.016
It's OK because people
started coming to our shows,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.296
and we started touring,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.776
and we came out with a record.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.856
And when I checked
our bank account balance

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.736
after our first monthly iTunes payout,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.256
we had 22,000 bucks in it,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.536
which was amazing because at the time
I was living at my dad's house,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.016
trying to make a living as a musician
by uploading videos to the internet

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.856
which literally zero people
respected in 2009 --

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.616
even the people who were
uploading videos to the internet.
