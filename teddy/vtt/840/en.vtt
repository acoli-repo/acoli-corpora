00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
from 85 countries around the world

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have come together over several decades

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to build this machine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What we do is we accelerate protons --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so, hydrogen nuclei --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
around 99.999999

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
percent the speed of light.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Right? At that speed, they go around

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.
