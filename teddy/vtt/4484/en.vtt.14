00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and create a movement of proper building.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
If you reach out to the people on the ground

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in this collaborative way

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's extremely affordable.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
For the billions spent on reconstruction,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you can train masons

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for dollars on every house

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that they end up building over their lifetime.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Ultimately, there are two ways

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that you can rebuild Haiti;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
the way at the top

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
