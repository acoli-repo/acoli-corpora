00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Adjusted for population density,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that is less than one percent

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of the impact of the Haitian quake.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What was the difference

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
between Chile and Haiti?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Seismic standards

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and confined masonry,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
where the building acts as a whole --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
walls and columns

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and roofs and slabs

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
tied together to support each other --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
