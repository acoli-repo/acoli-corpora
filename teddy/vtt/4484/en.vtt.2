00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a nurses' college --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there are 300 nurses studying.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The general hospital right next door

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
emerged largely unscathed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We have all heard

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about the tremendous human loss

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the earthquake in Haiti,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but we haven't heard enough

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
about why all those lives were lost.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We haven't heard about

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
why the buildings failed.
