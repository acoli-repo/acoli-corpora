00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
This is Xantus Daniel;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
he's a mason,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
just a general construction worker, not a foreman,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
who took one of our trainings.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
On his last job he was working with his boss,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and they started pouring the columns wrong.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He took his boss aside,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It won't cost us any more

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to do it the right way."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they redid that building.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They tied the rebar right,
