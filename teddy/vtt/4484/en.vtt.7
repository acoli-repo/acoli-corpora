00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that's a roof slab hanging off the building --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
cantilevered structures,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
or structures that were asymmetric,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that shook violently and came down,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
poor building materials,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
not enough concrete,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not enough compression in the blocks,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
rebar that was smooth,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now there's a solution

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to all these problems.
