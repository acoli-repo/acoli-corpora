00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now there's a solution

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to all these problems.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And we know how to build properly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The proof of this came in Chile,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
almost a month later,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
when 8.8 magnitude earthquake

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
hit Chile.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
That is 500 times

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the power of the 7.0

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that hit Port-au-Prince --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
500 times the power,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
yet only under a thousand casualties.
