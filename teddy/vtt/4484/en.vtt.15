00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The way at the top

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is a poorly constructed building

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that will fail.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
where the walls are tied together,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the building is symmetric,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and it will stand up to an earthquake.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
For all the disaster,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there is an opportunity here

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
to build better houses

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
for the next generation,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
so that when the next earthquake hits,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it is a disaster --
