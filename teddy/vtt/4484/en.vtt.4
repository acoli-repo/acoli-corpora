00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in decades,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it was not a natural disaster --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it was a disaster of engineering.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
AIDG has worked in Haiti

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
since 2007,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
providing engineering and business support

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to small businesses.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to figure out why the buildings collapsed,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to examine what was safe and what wasn't.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Working with MINUSTAH,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,
