We haven't heard about

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
why the buildings failed.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
not the earthquake,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that killed 220,000 people,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that injured 330,000,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that displaced 1.3 million people,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that cut off food

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and water and supplies

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
for an entire nation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster
