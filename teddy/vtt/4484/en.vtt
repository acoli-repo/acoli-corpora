00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My wife sent me a message,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Whoa, earthquake,"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then disappeared for 25 minutes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was afraid of a tsunami;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
what I didn't realize

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was there was a greater terror in Haiti,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that was building collapse.
