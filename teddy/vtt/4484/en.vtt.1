00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that was building collapse.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We've all seen the photos

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These are shots my wife took

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a couple days after the quake,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is the national palace --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the equivalent of the White House.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at peak shopping time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a nurses' college --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there are 300 nurses studying.
