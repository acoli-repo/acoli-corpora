00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who's the director

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
at the University of Buffalo --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was examining it to see if it was safe

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to recover the archives.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Andre told me,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
after seeing these buildings fail

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
again and again in the same way,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that there is no new research here.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There is nothing here that we don't know.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The failure points were the same:

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --
