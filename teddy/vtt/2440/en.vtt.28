00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:02.988
and get people to recall
the memory in edit mode

00:14:03.012 --> 00:14:06.270
and then get them to do
a highly engaging visual task

00:14:06.294 --> 00:14:08.088
like playing Tetris,

00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:12.412
it should be possible to introduce
so much interfering information

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.753
into that memory

00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:16.406
that it essentially becomes meaningless.

00:14:17.644 --> 00:14:18.828
That's the theory,

00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:22.323
and it's supported by data
from healthy human volunteers.

00:14:22.823 --> 00:14:26.748
Now, our volunteers watched
highly unpleasant films --

00:14:26.772 --> 00:14:30.308
so, think eye surgery,
road traffic safety adverts,
