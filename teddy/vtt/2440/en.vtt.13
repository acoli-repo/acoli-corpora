00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:31.798
because the hippocampus
is not storing what, where and when.

00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:35.541
In this way, these cues
can control behavior

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:37.670
when it's no longer appropriate,

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:40.377
and that's how
they become maladaptive.

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:46.617
So if we know that PTSD
is due to maladaptive memories,

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.883
can we use that knowledge
to improve treatment outcomes

00:06:49.907 --> 00:06:51.658
for patients with PTSD?

00:06:53.508 --> 00:06:58.312
A radical new approach being developed
to treat post-traumatic stress disorder

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:01.898
aims to destroy those maladaptive
emotional memories
