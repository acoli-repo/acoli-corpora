00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.267
Now, I hate wasps.

00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.802
I can tell you that fact.

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:37.406
But what I can't give you
are the non-declarative emotional memories

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.711
for how I react
when there's a wasp nearby.

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.333
I can't give you the racing heart,

00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:45.869
the sweaty palms,
that sense of rising panic.

00:04:45.893 --> 00:04:48.056
I can describe them to you,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.355
but I can't give them to you.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:55.270
Now, importantly,
from the perspective of PTSD,

00:04:55.294 --> 00:05:00.056
stress has very different effects on
declarative and non-declarative memories
