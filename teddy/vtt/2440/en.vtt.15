00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.639
and after that, they were permanent.

00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.779
This is known as the consolidation view.

00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.111
However, more recent research suggests
that making a memory

00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:41.412
is actually more like writing
in a word processor.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:45.518
We initially make the memory
and then we save it or store it.

00:07:45.542 --> 00:07:49.300
But under the right conditions,
we can edit that memory.

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.914
This reconsolidation view suggests
that those structural changes

00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:56.334
that happen in the brain to support memory

00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:57.989
can be undone,

00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:00.451
even for old memories.
