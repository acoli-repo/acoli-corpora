00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:31.108
As you can see, there are two
major distinctions in our types of memory.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.342
There are those memories
that we're consciously aware of,

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.530
where we know we know

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.301
and that we can pass on in words.

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:40.349
This would include memories
for facts and events.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.115
Because we can declare these memories,

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.690
we refer to these as declarative memories.

00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:49.879
The other type of memory
is non-declarative.

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:53.881
These are memories where we often
don't have conscious access

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.609
to the content of those memories

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.567
and that we can't pass on in words.

00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:01.200
The classic example
of a non-declarative memory
