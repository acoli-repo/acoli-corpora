00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:01.898
aims to destroy those maladaptive
emotional memories

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.639
that underlie the disorder.

00:07:04.338 --> 00:07:07.014
This approach has only
been considered a possibility

00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:10.320
because of the profound changes
in our understanding of memory

00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:11.759
in recent years.

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:15.030
Traditionally, it was thought
that making a memory

00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:17.694
was like writing in a notebook in pen:

00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:21.200
once the ink had dried,
you couldn't change the information.

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:23.949
It was thought that all
those structural changes

00:07:23.973 --> 00:07:26.675
that happen in the brain
to support the storage of memory

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:28.554
were finished within about six hours,

00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.639
and after that, they were permanent.
