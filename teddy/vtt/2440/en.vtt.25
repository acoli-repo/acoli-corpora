00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:34.181
Because Propranolol is only acting
on the non-declarative emotional memory,

00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:37.651
it seems unlikely that it would affect
eyewitness testimony,

00:12:37.675 --> 00:12:40.074
which is based on declarative memory.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.443
Essentially, what these
memory-destroying treatments

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:44.645
are aiming to do

00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:46.769
is to reduce the emotional memory,

00:12:46.793 --> 00:12:49.671
not get rid of the trauma
memory altogether.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.562
This should make the responses
of those with PTSD

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:55.914
more like those who have
been through trauma

00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:58.130
and not developed PTSD

00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:01.643
than people who have never
experienced trauma in the first place.
