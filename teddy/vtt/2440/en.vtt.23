even maladaptive memories
like those underlying PTSD.

00:11:33.396 --> 00:11:36.159
In fact, a number of labs
in several different countries

00:11:36.183 --> 00:11:40.663
have begun small-scale clinical trials
of these memory-destroying treatments

00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:41.979
for PTSD

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:44.679
and have found really promising results.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.263
Now, these studies need replication
on a larger scale,

00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:52.737
but they show the promise
of these memory-destroying treatments

00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:54.743
for PTSD.

00:11:54.767 --> 00:12:00.321
Maybe trauma memories do not need to be
the hell from which we cannot escape.
