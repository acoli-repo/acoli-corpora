00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:00.241
we are not storing the details,

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.987
the specific details
of what, where and when.

00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:07.785
Now, while stress is doing that
to the hippocampus,

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.640
look at what it does to the amygdala,

00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:13.080
that structure important
for the emotional, non-declarative memory.

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:16.289
Its activity gets stronger and stronger.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.206
So what this leaves
us with in PTSD

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.172
is an overly strong emotional --
in this case fear -- memory

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.112
that is not tied
to a specific time or place,

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:31.798
because the hippocampus
is not storing what, where and when.
