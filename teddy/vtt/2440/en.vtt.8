00:03:57.558 --> 00:04:01.039
and refers to our ability
to learn about cues in our environment

00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:04.012
and their emotional
and motivational significance.

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.954
What do I mean by that?

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:10.733
Well, think of a cue
like the smell of baking bread,

00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:13.497
or a more abstract cue
like a 20-pound note.

00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:17.246
Because these cues have been pegged
with good things in the past,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.190
we like them and we approach them.

00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:24.813
Other cues, like the buzzing of a wasp,
elicit very negative emotions

00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:28.629
and quite dramatic
avoidance behavior in some people.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.267
Now, I hate wasps.
