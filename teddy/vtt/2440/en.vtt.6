00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:01.200
The classic example
of a non-declarative memory

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.700
is the motor skill for riding a bike.

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:07.606
Now, this being Cambridge,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.681
You know what you're doing on two wheels.

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:13.403
But if I asked you to write me

for his last birthday,

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:22.321

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.640
How should you sit on the bike
so you're balanced?

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.142
How fast do you need to pedal
so you're stable?

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.563
If a gust of wind comes at you,
