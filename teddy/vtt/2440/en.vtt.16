00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:00.451
even for old memories.

00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:05.690
Now, this editing process
isn't happening all the time.

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:08.704
It only happens under
very specific conditions

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:10.432
of memory retrieval.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.866
So let's consider memory retrieval
as being recalling the memory

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.044
or, like, opening the file.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:20.613
Quite often, we are simply
retrieving the memory.

00:08:20.637 --> 00:08:23.158
We're opening the file as read-only.

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:25.733
But under the right conditions,

00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.068
we can open that file in edit mode,

00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:30.310
and then we can change the information.
