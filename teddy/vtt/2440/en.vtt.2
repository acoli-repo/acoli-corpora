00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:01.015
But some events
are so extreme that many --

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.801
up to half of those who survive
sexual violence, for example --

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:07.916
will go on to develop
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.303
or PTSD.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:13.956
PTSD is a debilitating
mental health condition

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.298
characterized by symptoms
such as intense fear and anxiety

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.901
and flashbacks of the traumatic event.

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:26.045
These symptoms have a huge impact
on a person's quality of life

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.903
and are often triggered
by particular situations

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.708
or cues in that person's environment.
