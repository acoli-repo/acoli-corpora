00:10:27.992 --> 00:10:30.473
they could still describe the relationship

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:34.205
between the cue
and the frightening outcome.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:38.715
It was as if they knew
they should be afraid,

00:10:39.652 --> 00:10:41.065
and yet they weren't.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.424
This suggests that Propranolol
can selectively target

00:10:45.448 --> 00:10:47.983
the non-declarative emotional memory

00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:51.693
but leave the declarative
event memory intact.

00:10:52.053 --> 00:10:56.460
But critically, Propranolol can only have
any effect on the memory

00:10:56.484 --> 00:10:58.318
if it's in edit mode.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.089
So how do we make a memory unstable?
