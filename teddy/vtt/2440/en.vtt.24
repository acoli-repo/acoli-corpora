Maybe trauma memories do not need to be
the hell from which we cannot escape.

00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:05.828
Now, although this memory-destroying
approach holds great promise,

00:12:05.852 --> 00:12:08.403
that's not to say
that it's straightforward

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.514
or without controversy.

00:12:10.538 --> 00:12:12.728
Is it ethical to destroy memories?

00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:14.970
What about things
like eyewitness testimony?

00:12:15.488 --> 00:12:17.674
What if you can't give someone Propranolol

00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:20.960
because it would interfere
with other medicines that they're taking?

00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:24.396
Well, with respect to ethics
and eyewitness testimony,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.456
I would say the important
point to remember

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.777
is the finding from that human study.

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:34.181
Because Propranolol is only acting
on the non-declarative emotional memory,
