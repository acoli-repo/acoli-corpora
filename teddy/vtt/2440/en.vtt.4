then the responses
to those cues, those memories,

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:03.924

In this way, we can think of PTSD
as being a disorder of maladaptive memory.

Now, I should stop myself here,

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.115

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:31.108
As you can see, there are two
major distinctions in our types of memory.
