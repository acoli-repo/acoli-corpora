stress has very different effects on
declarative and non-declarative memories

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.806
and the brain circuits
and regions supporting them.

00:05:03.463 --> 00:05:06.840
Emotional memory is supported
by a small almond-shaped structure

00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:08.022
called the amygdala

00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:09.280
and its connections.

00:05:09.883 --> 00:05:14.376
Declarative memory, especially the what,
where and when of event memory,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.976
is supported by a seahorse-shaped
region of the brain

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.494
called the hippocampus.

00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:22.489
The extreme levels of stress
experienced during trauma

00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:25.848
have very different effects
on these two structures.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:30.036
As you can see, as you increase
a person's level of stress
