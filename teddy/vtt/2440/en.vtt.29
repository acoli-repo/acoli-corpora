so, think eye surgery,
road traffic safety adverts,

00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:32.076
Scorsese's "The Big Shave."

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:36.933
These trauma films produce
something like flashbacks

00:14:36.957 --> 00:14:40.694
in healthy volunteers
for about a week after viewing them.

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:45.110
We found that getting people
to recall those memories,

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.181
the worst moments
of those unpleasant films,

00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:50.751
and playing Tetris at the same time,

00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:54.364
massively reduced the frequency
of the flashbacks.

00:14:54.388 --> 00:14:58.565
And again: the memory had to be
in edit mode for that to work.
