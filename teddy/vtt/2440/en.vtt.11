00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:30.036
As you can see, as you increase
a person's level of stress

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.105
from not stressful to slightly stressful,

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:33.381
the hippocampus,

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:35.605
acting to support the event memory,

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.289
increases in its activity

00:05:37.313 --> 00:05:40.593
and works better to support
the storage of that declarative memory.

00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:45.001
But as you increase to moderately
stressful, intensely stressful

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:48.620
and then extremely stressful,
as would be found in trauma,

00:05:48.644 --> 00:05:52.323
the hippocampus
effectively shuts down.

00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.147
This means that under
the high levels of stress hormones

00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:58.194
that are experienced
during trauma,

00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:00.241
