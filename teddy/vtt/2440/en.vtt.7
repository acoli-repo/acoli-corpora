If a gust of wind comes at you,

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:33.372
which muscles should you tense
and by how much

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:35.421
so that you don't get blown off?

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:39.649
I'll be staggered if you can give
the answers to those questions.

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:43.352
But if you can ride a bike,
you do have the answers,

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:45.762
you're just not consciously aware of them.

00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:55.101
is emotional memory.

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.534
Now, this has a specific
meaning in psychology

00:03:57.558 --> 00:04:01.039
and refers to our ability
to learn about cues in our environment
