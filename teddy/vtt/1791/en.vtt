00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:03.107
It was less than a year after September 11,

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:04.782
and I was at the Chicago Tribune

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:06.656
writing about shootings and murders,

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.118
and it was leaving me feeling

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.900
pretty dark and depressed.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.482
I had done some activism in college,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.129
so I decided to help a local group

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.838
hang door knockers against animal testing.

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:17.345
I thought it would be a safe way

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.227
to do something positive,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.793
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.118
and we were all arrested.

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.330
Police took this blurry photo of me

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.556
holding leaflets as evidence.

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.420
My charges were dismissed,
