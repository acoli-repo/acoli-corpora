00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.520
So how many of you have a robot at home?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.856
OK, I see about 20, 30 hands.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.536
That's actually pretty good.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.160
How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.096
I know I would!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.456
OK, so why doesn't this exist?
