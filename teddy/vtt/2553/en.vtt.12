00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:06.052
as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.

00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:12.975
One man approached them
with a small baby perched on his shoulder,

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.649
nine months old -- Malek.

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:19.752
He was holding onto a gas canister
to stay afloat, and he said to them,

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:21.726
"I fear I am not going to survive.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.416
I'm too weak. I don't have
the courage anymore."

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:29.975
And he handed little Malek
over to Bassem and to Doaa,

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.711
and they perched her onto the life ring.
