"I believe you saved
my little niece, Masa."

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:34.741
And it had this photo.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:38.003
This was from Masa's uncle,

00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:42.749
a Syrian refugee who had made it
to Sweden with his family

00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:44.980
and also Masa's older sister.

00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:51.331
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited
with him in Sweden,

00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:56.879
and until then, she's being cared for
in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.

00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:04.003
And Doaa? Well, word went around
about her survival, too.
