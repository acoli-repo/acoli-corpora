Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.674
that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:42.294
And the war that drove them there
was still raging in its fourth year.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.208
And the community
that once welcomed them there

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:48.597
had become weary of them.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:52.306
And one day, men on motorcycles
tried to kidnap her.

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:57.833
Once an aspiring student
thinking only of her future,

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:01.435
now she was scared all the time.
