00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:04.059
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
who was terrified of the water,

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.975
who couldn't swim,

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:11.591
found herself in charge
of two little baby kids.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:15.296
And they were thirsty and they were hungry
and they were agitated,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.018
and she tried her best to amuse them,

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:22.075
to sing to them, to say words
to them from the Quran.

00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:27.668
Around them, the bodies were bloating
and turning black.

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.438
The sun was blazing during the day.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.182
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.
