00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.044
And Doaa climbed onto the ring,

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:33.788
her arms and her legs
dangling by the side.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.776
Bassem was a good swimmer,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.594
so he held her hand and tread water.

00:05:42.064 --> 00:05:44.002
Around them there were corpses.

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:46.494
Around 100 people survived initially,

00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:51.059
and they started coming together
in groups, praying for rescue.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:55.400
But when a day went by and no one came,

00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:57.249
some people gave up hope,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.447
and Doaa and Bassem watched

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:06.052
as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.
