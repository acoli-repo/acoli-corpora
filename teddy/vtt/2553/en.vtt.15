00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.319
Hundreds of thousands of people
live in camps like these,

00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:38.316
and thousands and thousands more,
millions, live in towns and cities.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.558
And the communities,

00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:42.438
the neighboring countries
that once welcomed them

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.224
with open arms and hearts

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:45.866
are overwhelmed.

00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:51.183
There are simply not enough schools,
water systems, sanitation.

00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:56.370
Even rich European countries
could never handle such an influx

00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.637
without massive investment.
