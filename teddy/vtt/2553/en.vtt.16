00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:06.433
The Syria war has driven almost
four million people over the borders,

00:08:06.457 --> 00:08:11.394
but over seven million people
are on the run inside the country.

00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:15.109
That means that over half
the Syrian population

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.393
has been forced to flee.

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:22.059
Back to those neighboring
countries hosting so many.

00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:28.147
They feel that the richer world
has done too little to support them.

00:08:29.401 --> 00:08:33.798
And days have turned into months,
months into years.
