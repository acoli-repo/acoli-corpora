00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:07.521
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories
of people fleeing for their lives,

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.458
across dangerous borders
and unfriendly seas.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.604
But there's one story
that keeps me awake at night,

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.184
and it's about Doaa.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.031
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:26.891
she was living a grinding existence
in Egypt working day wages.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:32.302
Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria
