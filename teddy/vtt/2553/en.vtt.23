But that afternoon,
as the sun was going down,

00:11:30.244 --> 00:11:33.100
she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:38.126
And she said, "Please, God,
let them rescue me."

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.110

like she shouted for about two hours.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:46.744
And it had become dark,
but finally the searchlights found her

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:48.975
and they extended a rope,

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:53.968
astonished to see a woman
clutching onto two babies.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.258
They pulled them onto the boat,
they got oxygen and blankets,

00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:01.289
and a Greek helicopter came
to pick them up
