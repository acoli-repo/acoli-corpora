00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.241
and she deserves all that praise,

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.686
and she deserves a second chance.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:39.439
But she wants to still go to Sweden.

00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:41.693
She wants to reunite
with her family there.

00:15:41.717 --> 00:15:45.828
She wants to bring her mother
and her father and her younger siblings

00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:48.170
away from Egypt there as well,

00:15:48.194 --> 00:15:51.375
and I believe she will succeed.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.121
She wants to become a lawyer
or a politician

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:59.039
or something that can help
fight injustice.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:02.127
She is an extraordinary survivor.
