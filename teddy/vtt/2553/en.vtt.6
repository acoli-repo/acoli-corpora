00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:00.784
Doaa was sitting with her legs
crammed up to her chest,

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.323
Bassem holding her hand.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:07.093
Day two on the water,
they were sick with worry

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:10.196
and sick to their stomachs
from the rough sea.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.084
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.

00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:19.621
And she said to Bassem,
"I fear we're not going to make it.

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.684
I fear the boat is going to sink."

00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.666
And Bassem said to her,
"Please be patient.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.872
We will make it to Sweden,
we will get married

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:30.450
and we will have a future."
