00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:11.772
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe.

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:16.272
Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole,

00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:19.112
be it an asteroid, planet, or star,

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:23.802
risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:28.525
And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon,

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.636
it’ll disappear and never re-emerge,
