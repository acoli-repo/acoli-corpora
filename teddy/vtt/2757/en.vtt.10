00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.007
in constructing such detectors

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.296
are enormous.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.646
But physicists are ingenious,

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:09.408
and with the support
of a broad lay public,

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.947
all obstacles will surely be overcome."

00:05:14.138 --> 00:05:17.658
Thorne published that in 1973,

00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:21.006
42 years before he succeeded.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:24.408
Now, coming back to LIGO,

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:27.646
Scott likes to say that LIGO
acts like an ear

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.248
more than it does like an eye.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.839
I want to explain what that means.
