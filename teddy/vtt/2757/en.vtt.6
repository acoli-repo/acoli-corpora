Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend
and collaborator, Scott Hughes,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.801
a theoretical physicist at MIT,

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.610
who has been studying
gravitational waves from black holes

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:22.163
and the signals that they could impart

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.557
A gravitational wave is a ripple
