00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.683
in all of the known Universe.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:33.814
It was a very

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:35.377
big

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.551
bang.

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:41.111
But they didn't release
their energy in light.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.491
I mean, you know, they're black holes.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.070
All that energy was pumped
into the fabric of space and time itself,

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.707
making the Universe explode
in gravitational waves.

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.825
Let me give you a sense
of the timescale at work here.

00:00:57.317 --> 00:00:59.928
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:03.067
Earth had just managed to evolve
multicellular life.
