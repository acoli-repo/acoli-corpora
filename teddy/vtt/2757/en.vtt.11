00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.839
I want to explain what that means.

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:34.185
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.782
that's much smaller
than the things around you,

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:38.305
the features on people's faces,

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.082
the size of your cell phone.

00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:42.789
And that's really useful,

00:05:42.813 --> 00:05:46.020
because it lets you make an image
or a map of the things around you,

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:48.432
by looking at the light
coming from different spots

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:49.607
in the scene about you.

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.574
Sound is different.

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:55.561
Audible sound has a wavelength
that can be up to 50 feet long.

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.362
And that makes it really difficult --

00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:00.426
in fact, in practical purposes,
impossible -- to make an image
