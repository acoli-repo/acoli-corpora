00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:04.080
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.174
in a distant, distant galaxy,

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:10.552
two black holes locked into a spiral,

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.655
falling inexorably towards each other

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:14.608
and collided,

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:17.575
converting three Suns' worth of stuff

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.428
into pure energy in a tenth of a second.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.801
For that brief moment in time,

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:27.950
the glow was brighter than all the stars

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.635
in all the galaxies

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.683
in all of the known Universe.
