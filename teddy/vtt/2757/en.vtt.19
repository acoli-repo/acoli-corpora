00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.358
things that we'll only
discover by listening.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:33.915
And in fact, even
in that very first event,

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:36.985
LIGO found things that we didn't expect.

00:09:37.564 --> 00:09:41.055
Here's my colleague and one of the key
members of the LIGO collaboration,

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:44.717
Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,
addressing exactly that:

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:47.951
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars
which produce the black holes

00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:49.237
that we observed here

00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.039
are the dinosaurs of the Universe.

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:54.738
They're these massive things
that are old, from prehistoric times,

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:57.408
and the black holes are kind of like
the dinosaur bones

00:09:57.432 --> 00:09:59.050
with which we do this archeology.

00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:01.622
So it lets us really get
a whole nother angle
