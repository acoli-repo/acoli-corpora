00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:00.909
The Big Bang: I would love
to be able to explore

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.772
the first few moments of the Universe,

00:09:03.796 --> 00:09:05.444
but we'll never see them,

00:09:05.468 --> 00:09:09.774
because the Big Bang itself
is obscured by its own afterglow.

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:12.322
With gravitational waves,

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:15.830
we should be able to see
all the way back to the beginning.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:18.219
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:20.681
I'm positive that there
are things out there

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.891
that we've never seen

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:24.668
that we may never be able to see

00:09:24.692 --> 00:09:26.533
and that we haven't even imagined --

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.358
things that we'll only
discover by listening.
