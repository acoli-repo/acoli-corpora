00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:30.256
And on September 14 of 2015,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.771
just days after the detector
had gone live,

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:38.629
the gravitational waves
from those colliding black holes

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.128
passed through the Earth.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.016
And they passed through you and me.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.611
And they passed through the detector.

00:02:47.143 --> 00:02:49.644
(Audio) Scott Hughes:
There's two moments in my life

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.359
more emotionally intense than that.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:52.922
One is the birth of my daughter.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:57.033
The other is when I had to say goodbye
to my father when he was terminally ill.

00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.222
You know, it was the payoff
of my career, basically.
