Even with a laser detector five kilometers
long -- and that's already crazy --

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.307
they would have to measure
the length of those detectors

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:41.059
to less than one thousandth
of the radius of the nucleus

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:42.241
of an atom.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.105
And that's preposterous.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.624
So towards the end
of his classic text on gravity,

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:51.270
LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.495
described the hunt
for gravitational waves as follows:

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.670
He said, "The technical difficulties
to be surmounted

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.007
in constructing such detectors
