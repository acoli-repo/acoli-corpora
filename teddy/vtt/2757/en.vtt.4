The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.961
For the last several years,

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:09.584
LIGO's been undergoing
a huge expansion in its accuracy,

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.600
a tremendous improvement
in its detection ability.

00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:14.970
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.362
In early September of 2015,

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.861
LIGO turned on for a final test run

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.739
while they sorted out
a few lingering details.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:30.256
And on September 14 of 2015,
