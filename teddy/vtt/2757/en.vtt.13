00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:30.752
We can't use them to make simple images
of things out in the Universe.

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:32.452
But by listening to changes

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:35.919
in the amplitude and frequency
of those waves,

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:39.002
we can hear the story
that those waves are telling.

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:41.765
And at least for LIGO,

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.987
the frequencies that it can hear
are in the audio band.

00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.563
So if we convert the wave patterns
into pressure waves and air, into sound,

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:53.899
we can literally hear
the Universe speaking to us.

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:59.220
For example, listening to gravity,
just in this way,

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.934
can tell us a lot about the collision
of two black holes,
