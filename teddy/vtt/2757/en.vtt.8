WEBVTT

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.898
is that they're very weak;
they're preposterously weak.

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:04.700
For example, the waves that hit us
on September 14 --

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:09.418
and yes, every single one of you
stretched and compressed

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:11.012
under the action of that wave --

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.639
when the waves hit, they stretched
the average person

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:17.774
by one part in 10 to the 21.

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:20.670
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.860
and a one.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.984
That's why everyone thought
the LIGO people were nuts.

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:33.405
Even with a laser detector five kilometers
long -- and that's already crazy --
