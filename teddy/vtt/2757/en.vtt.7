00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.557
A gravitational wave is a ripple

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.010
in the shape of space and time.

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.479
As the wave passes by,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:39.882
it stretches space and everything in it

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.065
in one direction,

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.080
and compresses it in the other.

00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:46.942
This has led to countless instructors
of general relativity

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:50.898
doing a really silly dance to demonstrate
in their classes on general relativity.

00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:53.679
"It stretches and expands,
it stretches and expands."

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.256
So the trouble with gravitational waves

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.898
is that they're very weak;
they're preposterously weak.
