00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.984
with which to search
for the gravitational waves

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.260
from things like colliding black holes.

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:36.414
Now, most people thought they were nuts.

00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:41.201
But enough people realized
that they were brilliant nuts

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:46.264
that the US National Science Foundation
decided to fund their crazy idea.

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:49.633
So after decades of development,

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:52.136
construction and imagination

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.144
and a breathtaking amount of hard work,

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.319
they built their detector, called LIGO:

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:03.040
The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
