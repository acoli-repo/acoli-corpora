00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:00.426
in fact, in practical purposes,
impossible -- to make an image

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.268
of something you really care about.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:03.632
Your child's face.

00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:08.907
Instead, we use sound
to listen for features like pitch

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.049
and tone and rhythm and volume

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:15.446
to infer a story behind the sounds.

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:17.919
That's Alice talking.

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:19.476
That's Bob interrupting.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.750
Silly Bob.

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.854
So, the same is true
of gravitational waves.

00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:30.752
We can't use them to make simple images
of things out in the Universe.
