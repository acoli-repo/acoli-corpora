Earth had just managed to evolve
multicellular life.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.902
Since then, Earth has made and evolved

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:13.317
corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people
and even -- God save us -- the Internet.

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:16.578
And about 25 years ago,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.620
a particularly audacious set of people --

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:24.023
Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne
and Ronald Drever at Caltech --

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.841
decided that it would be really neat

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:28.578
to build a giant laser detector

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.984
with which to search
for the gravitational waves
