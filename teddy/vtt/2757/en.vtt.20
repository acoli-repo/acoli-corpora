00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:01.622
So it lets us really get
a whole nother angle

00:10:01.646 --> 00:10:03.527
on what's out there in the Universe

00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:06.314
and how the stars came to be,
and in the end, of course,

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:09.037
how we came to be out of this whole mess.

00:10:10.304 --> 00:10:11.956
AA: Our challenge now

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.074
is to be as audacious as possible.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.742
Thanks to LIGO, we know how
to build exquisite detectors

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.335
that can listen to the Universe,

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:23.430
to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.078
Our job is to dream up and build
new observatories --

00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:29.133
a whole new generation of observatories --

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:31.156
on the ground, in space.
