Think for one second
about what I've just said:

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.600
they're in a place full of strangers

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.673
in an uninhibited environment.

00:02:41.853 --> 00:02:43.943
The internet broke physical boundaries.

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:48.775
When we're alone in our bedroom
and we go online,

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.376
we're not really alone.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.140
There are at least two reasons
why we're not taking care of this,

00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.866
or at least not in the right way.
