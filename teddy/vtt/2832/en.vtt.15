don't talk to strangers."

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:34.997
I knew everything about walking,

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:39.621

00:07:40.886 --> 00:07:42.862
Knowing how to do something is one thing,

00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:45.218
knowing how to take care
of yourself is another.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:48.537
Imagine this situation:

00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.125
I'm 10 or 11 years old,
I wake up in the morning,

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.265

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.422
"Seba, now you can walk to school alone."

00:07:56.487 --> 00:07:58.687
And when I come back late,

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:02.952
they say, "No, you need to be home
at the time we said."
