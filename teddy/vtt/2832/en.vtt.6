First, we're sure that everything
that happens online is "virtual."

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.233
In fact, we call it "the virtual world."

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.829
If you look it up in the dictionary,

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.291
something virtual is something
that seems to exist

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:17.594
but is not real.

00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:23.200
And we use that word
to talk about the internet:

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:24.624
something not real.

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.250
And that's the problem with grooming.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:30.674
It is real.
