00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:39.299
And we get angry at social networks

00:06:39.323 --> 00:06:43.313
because being angry with ourselves
is more painful and more true.

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:46.813
And this brings us
to the second reason why

00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:49.370
we aren't paying proper
attention to this issue.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.669
We're convinced that kids
don't need our help,

00:06:54.693 --> 00:06:56.951
that they "know everything"
about technology.
