I also asked why she used it.

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:02.220
What was fun about it?

00:11:03.738 --> 00:11:05.298
We had a really nice talk.

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:08.382
She showed me her Snapchat,
she told me things,

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.817
we got closer, we laughed.

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:14.329
Today, I use it.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.175
(Laughter)

00:11:16.788 --> 00:11:18.413
I don't know if I do it right,

00:11:18.437 --> 00:11:22.808
but the most important thing
is that I know it and I understand it.

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:28.543
The key was to overcome the initial shock

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:30.417
and do something new.
