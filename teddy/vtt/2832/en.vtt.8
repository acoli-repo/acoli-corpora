In 2013, we attended meetings
at the House of Legislature

00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:05.303
to discuss a law about grooming.

00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:09.963
I remember that a lot of people thought

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:12.159
that grooming was strictly a precursor

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:15.888
to arranging an in-person meeting
with a kid to have sex with them.

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:21.851
But they didn't think about what happened
to the kids who were exposed

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.933
by talking about sex
with an adult without knowing it,

00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:29.650
or who shared intimate photos thinking
only another kid would see them,

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:30.824
or even worse,
