What is it about flying cars?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And there are historic attempts

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that have had some level of technical success.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But we haven't yet gotten to the point

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where on your way here this morning

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the three-dimensional sky above us --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there
