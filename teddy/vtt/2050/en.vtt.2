00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
some of my ocean adventures

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and apply them to this environmental challenge

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that we face right now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, some of you might be thinking,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Isn't she meant to be about this tall

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and about this wide

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)
