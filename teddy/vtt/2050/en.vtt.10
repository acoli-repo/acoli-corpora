00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
3,000 miles was going to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
take me a very, very long time.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There were so many times

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
when I thought I'd hit that limit,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but had no choice but to just carry on

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
without driving myself crazy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And eventually after

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
103 days at sea,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I arrived in Antigua.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't think I've ever felt so happy

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in my entire life.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It was a bit like finishing a marathon

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and getting out of solitary confinement
