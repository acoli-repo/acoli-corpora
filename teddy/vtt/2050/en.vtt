Hi, my name is Roz Savage

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I row across oceans.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and since then, I've done two out of three stages

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
across the Pacific,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from San Francisco to Hawaii

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and from Hawaii to Kiribati.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to fly back to Kiribati

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to continue with the third and final stage

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of my row across the Pacific.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Cumulatively, I will have rowed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over 8,000 miles,
