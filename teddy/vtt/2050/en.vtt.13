00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in the right direction.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
That's a bad day at the office.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
What do I wear?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Mostly, a baseball cap,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
depending on whether I went backwards overnight --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and lots of sun lotion.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Do I have a chase boat?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I don't see anybody for the whole time
