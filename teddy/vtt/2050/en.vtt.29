00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and the Chernobyls,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but mostly it's been an accumulation

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
of bad decisions

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
by billions of individuals,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
day after day and year after year.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We can start making better,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
wiser, more sustainable decisions.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And when we do that, we're not just one person.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Anything that we do spreads ripples.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and you pull out your

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
reusable grocery bag.
