00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
would be about 8,000 miles.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
very rarely go in a straight line.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
By the time I get to Australia,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
if I get to Australia,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, because nobody in their straight mind would row

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
straight past Hawaii without dropping in,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I decided to cut this very big undertaking

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
into three segments.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The first attempt didn't go so well.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
three times in 24 hours.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
A bit like being in a washing machine.
