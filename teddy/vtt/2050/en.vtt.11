00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It was a bit like finishing a marathon

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and getting out of solitary confinement

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I was euphoric.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And to see all the people coming out to greet me

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I just felt like a movie star.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the bigger the sense of achievement

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
when you get to the end of it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that might be going through your mind.
