00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
extremely uncomfortable.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And my timing was not great either:

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
2005, when I did the Atlantic,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
was the year of Hurricane Katrina.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
than ever before, since records began.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And pretty early on,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
those storms started making their presence known.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
All four of my oars broke

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
before I reached halfway across.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oars are not supposed to look like this.
