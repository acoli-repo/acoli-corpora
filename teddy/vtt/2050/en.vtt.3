Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and I hope that it remains that way.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I was not one of them.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I was working in an office in London
