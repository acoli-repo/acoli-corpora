00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Powered by my solar panels,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
it sucks in saltwater

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and turns it into freshwater.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which is what happened to it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Fortunately, help was at hand.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
There was another unusual boat out there

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
at the same time, doing as I was doing,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
with an estimated 3.5 million

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
tons of trash in it,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
circulating at the center of

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that North Pacific Gyre.
