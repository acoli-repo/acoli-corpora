00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So there are very real implications for human health.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And, the following year, set out

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
on the second stage of the Pacific,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
from Hawaii down to Tarawa.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And you'll notice something about Tarawa;

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
it is very low-lying.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's that little green sliver on the horizon,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
which makes them very nervous

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
about rising oceans.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This is big trouble for these guys.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And also, as an increase in extreme
