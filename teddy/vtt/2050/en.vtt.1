00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over 8,000 miles,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
taken over three million oar strokes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and spent more than 312 days alone

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This has given me a very

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
special relationship with the ocean.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I feel a bit about it like I did about

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and she taught me a heck of a lot.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So today I'd like to share with you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
some of my ocean adventures
