00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which was the best food I'd had

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in, ooh, at least three months.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When they opened this one up,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they found its stomach was full of plastic.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And this is really bad news because plastic

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is not an inert substance.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It leaches out chemicals

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and then we come along and eat that poor critter,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and we get some of the toxins accumulating

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
in our bodies as well.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So there are very real implications for human health.
