00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
circulating at the center of

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that North Pacific Gyre.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, to make the point, these guys

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
15,000 empty water bottles

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
latched together into two pontoons.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and they were starting to sink.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,
