00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
For so long, I told myself

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that I couldn't have an adventure

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
because I wasn't six foot tall

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and athletic and bearded.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And then that story changed.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So even though I didn't grow any taller,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I didn't sprout a beard,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is that we need all this stuff,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that we need oil.
