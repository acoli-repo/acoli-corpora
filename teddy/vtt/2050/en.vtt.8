00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
before I reached halfway across.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oars are not supposed to look like this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Oars are your only means of propulsion.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I just had to look around the boat

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and figure out what I was going to use

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and splintered the boat hook

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to the oars to reinforce it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Then, when that gave out,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and used those.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
