00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
luckily, our courses were converging.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it took about a week

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
for us to actually gradually converge.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I was doing a pathetically slow speed

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of about 1.3 knots,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
it was like two snails in a mating dance.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and Joel hopped overboard,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which was the best food I'd had
