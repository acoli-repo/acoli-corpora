00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that might be going through your mind.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000

So I grow my own beansprouts.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting
