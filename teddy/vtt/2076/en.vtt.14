A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
you will bump into certain very important ideas.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and his qualities of humility and goodness

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and his generosity to the poor.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Now we don't think that way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I'll just come across it."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Nonsense, says the religious world view.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
we need to synchronize encounters.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This comes across also
