00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to cement these ideas in your mind,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we would get a lot more out of art.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Art should be one of the tools

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
by which we improve our society.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Art should be didactic.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Let's think of something else.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
who are interested in matters of the spirit,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in matters of the mind,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in higher soul-like concerns,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
tend to be isolated individuals.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.
