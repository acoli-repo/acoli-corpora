If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"Hey, how about a sermon?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm an independent, individual person."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
What's the difference between a sermon

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well a sermon wants to change your life

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because we are in need of guidance,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
morality and consolation --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and religions know that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Another point about education:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we tend to believe in the modern secular world
