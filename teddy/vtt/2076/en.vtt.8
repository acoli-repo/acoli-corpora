00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And that's a very plausible idea.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you went to a top university --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and you said, "I've come here

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I want to know how to live,"

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
are in the business of.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Why? They don't think we need it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
