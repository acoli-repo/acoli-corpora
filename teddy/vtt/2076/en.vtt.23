in the Christian view.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000

where we could come across works

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
where we would be told, use these works of art

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to cement these ideas in your mind,
