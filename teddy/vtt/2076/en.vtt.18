00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Applause)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we are also bodies.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And when they teach us a lesson,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
they do it via the body.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So for example,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Jews are very interested in forgiveness

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and how we should start anew and start afresh.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They don't just give us books or words about this.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
They tell us to have a bath.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.
