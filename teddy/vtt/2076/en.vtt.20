00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
You've heard that saying.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now I think that the potential is there,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but we've completely let ourselves down.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And the reason we've let ourselves down

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is that we're not properly studying

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
how religions handle art.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a ridiculous idea --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I couldn't disagree more.
