00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
They asked themselves the following question.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They said, where are people going to find the morality,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where are they going to find guidance,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And influential voices came up with one answer.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They said culture.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It's to culture that we should look

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
