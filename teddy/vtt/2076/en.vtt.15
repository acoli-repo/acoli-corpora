00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This comes across also

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
in the way in which religions set up rituals

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
around important feelings.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You know, when you look at the Moon,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
where you will be given poems to read

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time
