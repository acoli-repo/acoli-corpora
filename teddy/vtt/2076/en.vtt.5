00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a respectful and an impious way

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The secular world is full of holes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We have secularized badly, I would argue.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And a thorough study of religion

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
could give us all sorts of insights

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
into areas of life that are not going too well.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now education is a field

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the secular world really believes in.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.
