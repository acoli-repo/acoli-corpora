00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You immerse yourself in the water,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We don't tend to do that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Let's look at art now.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Now art is something that in the secular world,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We sometimes hear it said

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
You've heard that saying.
