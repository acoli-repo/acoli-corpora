00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
or you reject the doctrine and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So that's a sort of tough choice.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I don't think we have to make that choice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I think there is an alternative.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think there are ways --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of stealing from religions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you don't believe in a religion,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with taking out the best sides of religion.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And for me, atheism 2.0

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is about both, as I say,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a respectful and an impious way
