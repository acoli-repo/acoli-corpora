Art is about two things in all the major faiths.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Firstly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
of what there is to love.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And secondly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of what there is to fear and to hate.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And that's what art is.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So as you walk around a church,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
or a mosque or a cathedral,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
through your eyes, through your senses,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Essentially it's propaganda.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Rembrandt is a propagandist

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in the Christian view.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
