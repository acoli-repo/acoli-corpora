00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have argued --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
they've argued that believing in God

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is akin to believing in fairies

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and essentially that the whole thing

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is a childish game.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now I think it's too easy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I think it's too easy

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

And what I'd like to inaugurate today

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a new way of being an atheist --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
if you like, a new version of atheism

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we could call Atheism 2.0.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well it starts from a very basic premise:
