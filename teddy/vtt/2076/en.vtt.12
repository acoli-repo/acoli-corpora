Another point about education:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we tend to believe in the modern secular world

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and that lesson will stick with them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Religions go, "Nonsense.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So get on your knees and repeat it."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's what all religions tell us:

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So religions are cultures of repetition.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They circle the great truths again and again and again.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We associate repetition with boredom.
