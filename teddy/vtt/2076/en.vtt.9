00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Why? They don't think we need it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
They see us as adults, rational adults.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What we need is information.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We need data, we don't need help.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
All religions, all major religions,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
at various points call us children.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And like children,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We're only just holding it together.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
