00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You'll be handed rice cakes.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
will have a secure place in your heart.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That's very good.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The other thing that religions are really aware of

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is: speak well --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and still have a great career.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But the religious world doesn't think that way.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What you're saying needs to be backed up

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
by a really convincing way of saying it.
