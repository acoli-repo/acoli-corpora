00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
advising people how they could live.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and children to their parents,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
He was trying to tell people how they should live

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
through the medium of sermons,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the classic medium of delivery of religions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"Hey, how about a sermon?"
