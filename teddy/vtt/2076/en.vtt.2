00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well it starts from a very basic premise:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of course, there's no God.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or angels, etc.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that's the very, very beginning.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I can't believe in the doctrines.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't think these doctrines are right.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.
