00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
something else?"

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Science and just observation

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
gives us that feeling without it,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
so I don't feel the need.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
The universe is large and we are tiny,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
without the need for further religious superstructure.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So one can have so-called spiritual moments

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
without belief in the spirit.
