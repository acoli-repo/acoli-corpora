00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I couldn't disagree more.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and we might find it too easy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
let's admit it --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is, "I don't know what this is about."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to contemporary art.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
