When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
it's also going to make us better people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Interesting where it came from.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In the early 19th century,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
church attendance in Western Europe

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
They asked themselves the following question.
