00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
by a really convincing way of saying it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
in the American South

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and you listen to how they talk,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
my goodness, they talk well.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
If we were doing it like they do it --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
