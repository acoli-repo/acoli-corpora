00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but we can admire the institutional way

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in which they're doing it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
are not going to change anything.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We need to group together.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And that's what religions do.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
They are multinational, as I say,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
they are branded, they have a clear identity,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
so they don't get lost in a busy world.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
That's something we can learn from.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I want to conclude.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Really what I want to say
