00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.510
(Laughter)

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.812
And my brother, Kayak.

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.276
(Laughter)

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.585
There you go.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.745

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:39.878
(Laughter)

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:43.329
I like to kick things off with a joke
because I'm a comedian.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.734

I'm wasting no time.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.409
Here's a third thing
you can know about me:

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:55.404
I don't think I'm qualified
to speak my own mind.

00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:57.987
Bold way to begin a talk, yes,

00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:59.702
but it's true.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.985
I've always had a great deal of difficulty
