00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:00.602
but I had an idea.

00:13:00.626 --> 00:13:02.952
I had an idea to tell my truth,

00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:05.747
all of it,

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:11.001
not to share laughs but to share
the literal, visceral pain of my trauma.

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:14.332
And I thought the best way to do that
would be through a comedy show.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:16.203
And that is what I did.

00:13:16.227 --> 00:13:19.963
I wrote a comedy show
that did not respect the punchline,

00:13:19.987 --> 00:13:23.687
that line where comedians are expected
and trusted to pull their punches

00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.266
and turn them into tickles.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.475
I did not stop.

00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:28.119
I punched through that line

00:13:28.143 --> 00:13:31.636
into the metaphorical guts of my audience.
