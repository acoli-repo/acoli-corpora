00:08:58.277 --> 00:09:02.218
And I wasn't entirely sure
I was still connected to the trunk.

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.466
What was the purpose of my human?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.802
The year after my grandmother's death
was the most intensely creative

00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:11.986
of my life.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.416
And I suppose that's because,
at an end, my thoughts gather

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.897
more than they scatter.

00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:19.726
My thought process is not linear.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.265
I'm a visual thinker. I see my thoughts.

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:24.048
I don't have a photographic memory,

00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:30.020
and nor is my head a static gallery
of sensibly collected think pieces.
