00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:30.483
What is the purpose of my human?

00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:35.183
Out of anyone in my family,
I felt the most akin to my grandmother.

00:08:36.154 --> 00:08:39.224
I mean, we share the most
traits in common.

00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:40.898
Not so much these days.

00:08:40.922 --> 00:08:42.560
Death really changes people.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:43.744
But that --

00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:44.831
(Laughter)

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:47.191
is my grandmother's sense of humor.

00:08:47.215 --> 00:08:49.864
But the person I felt
most akin to in the world

00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:52.281
was a mother, a grandmother,
a great-grandmother,

00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:53.719
a great-great-grandmother.

00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:58.253
Me? I represented the very end
of my branch of the family tree.

00:08:58.277 --> 00:09:02.218
And I wasn't entirely sure
I was still connected to the trunk.
