But you might be surprised to find out
that I don't have three ideas.

00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:36.711
I told you I had three ideas,
and that was a lie.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:39.873
That was pure misdirection --
I'm very funny.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:46.573
What I've done instead is I've taken
whole handfuls of my ideas as seeds,

00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:49.157
and I've scattered them
all throughout my talk.

00:15:50.022 --> 00:15:51.678
And why did I do that?

00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:53.449
Well, apart from shits and giggles,

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.755
it comes down to something
my grandma always used to say.

00:15:59.386 --> 00:16:04.323
"It's not the garden,
it's the gardening that counts."
