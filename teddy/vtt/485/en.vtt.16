00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:04.352
growing up gay in a state
where homosexuality was illegal.

00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:07.091
And with that thought,
I could see how tightly wrapped

00:08:07.115 --> 00:08:10.928
in the tendrils of my own
internalized shame I was.

00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:13.785
And with that, I thought
about all my traumas:

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:16.773
the violence, the abuse, my rape.

00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:22.331
And with all that cluster of thinking,

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:25.498
a thought, a question,
kept popping into my mind

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:27.789
to which I had no answer:

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:30.483
What is the purpose of my human?
