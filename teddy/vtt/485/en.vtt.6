00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:00.258
that I want to share with you today.

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:03.702
And I've done that by way of sharing
three contradictions:

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:06.927
one, I am bad at talking,
I am good at talking;

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:09.694
I quit, I did not quit.

00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:11.555
Three ideas, three contradictions.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.060
Now, if you're wondering
why there's only two things

00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:15.611
on my so-called list of three --

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:16.669
(Laughter)

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.218
I remind you it is literally
a list of contradictions.

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:20.405
Keep up.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.953
(Laughter)

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:27.458
Now, the folks at TED advised me
that with a talk of this length,

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:30.234
it's best to stick
with just sharing one idea.
