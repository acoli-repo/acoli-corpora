00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.973
it was something of a one-sided goodbye.

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.786
So I thought about a lot of things,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.685
things I hadn't thought about
in a long time,

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:11.917
like the letters I used
to write to my grandma

00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:13.799
when I first started university,

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:16.571
letters I filled with funny
stories and anecdotes

00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:18.998
that I embellished for her amusement.

00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:21.636
And I remembered how I couldn't articulate

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.425
the anxiety and fear that filled me
as I tried to carve my tiny little life

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.556
into a world that felt far too big for me.
