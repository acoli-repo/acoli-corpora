00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.205

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.429
if you can spell.

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:14.755
But the thing is --

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.053
(Laughter)

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:19.296
my entire family have palindromic names.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.634

We've got Mum, Dad --

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.304
(Laughter)

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:28.538
Nan, Pop.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.510
(Laughter)
