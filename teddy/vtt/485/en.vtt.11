It's that time in the talk
where I shift into second gear,

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:34.795
and I'm going to tell you a story
about everything I've just said.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.033
In the last few days of her life,

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:40.050
my grandma was surrounded by people,

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:41.780
a lot of people,

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:44.276
because my grandma
was the loving matriarch

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.770
of a large and loving family.

00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:49.497
Now, if you haven't made
the connection already,

00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:51.011
I am a member of that family.

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:54.934
I was lucky enough to be able
to say goodbye to my grandma

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.878
on the day she died.

00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:59.895
But as she was already
cocooned within herself by then,

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.973
it was something of a one-sided goodbye.
