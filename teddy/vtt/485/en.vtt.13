into a world that felt far too big for me.

00:06:31.213 --> 00:06:34.209
But I remembered finding
comfort in those letters,

00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:37.250
because I wrote them
with my grandma in mind.

00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:40.733
But as the world got
more and more overwhelming

00:06:40.757 --> 00:06:44.744
and my ability to negotiate it
got worse, not better,

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:47.466
I stopped writing those letters.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:53.072
I just didn't think I had the life
that Grandma would want to read about.

00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:56.509
Grandma did not know I was gay,

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.483
and about six months before she died,

00:06:58.507 --> 00:07:01.397
out of nowhere, she asked me
if I had a boyfriend.
