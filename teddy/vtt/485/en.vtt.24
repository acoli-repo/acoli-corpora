and always had been.

00:12:02.168 --> 00:12:05.741
What was the purpose of my human?

00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:12.695
I began to think a lot about how autism
and PTSD have so much in common.

00:12:12.719 --> 00:12:14.357
And I started to worry,

00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.113
because I had both.

00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:19.332
Could I ever untangle them?

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:22.901
I'd always been told
that the way out of trauma

00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:25.543
was through a cohesive narrative.

00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:28.164
I had a cohesive narrative,

00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:30.535
but I was still at the mercy
of my traumas.
