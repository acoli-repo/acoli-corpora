00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:30.535
but I was still at the mercy
of my traumas.

00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.144
They're all part of my soup,
but the onions still stung.

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:37.672
And at that point, I realized

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:40.392
that I'd been telling
my stories for laughs.

00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:43.254
I'd been trimming away the darkness,
cutting away the pain

00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:47.346
and holding on to my trauma
for the comfort of my audience.

00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:50.414
I was connecting
other people through laughs,

00:12:50.438 --> 00:12:53.701
yet I remained profoundly disconnected.

00:12:53.725 --> 00:12:56.871
What was the purpose of my human?

00:12:56.895 --> 00:12:58.633
I did not have an answer,

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:00.602
but I had an idea.
