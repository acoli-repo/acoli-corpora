00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:00.040
(Laughter)

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:03.074
I just couldn't work it out,
I could not understand it.

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:05.057
That is, until I could.

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:07.952
Now, before I explain to you why it is

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:11.232
that I can be good
at something I'm so bad at,

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:14.103
let me throw another spanner
of contradiction into the work

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:18.407
by telling you that not long after
I worked out why that was,

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.503
I decided to quit comedy.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.741
And before I explain
that little oppositional cat

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.467
I just threw amongst the thinking pigeons,

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.060
let me also tell you this:

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.937
quitting launched my comedy career.
