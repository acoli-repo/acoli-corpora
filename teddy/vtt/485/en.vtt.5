00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.937
quitting launched my comedy career.

00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:33.919
(Laughter)

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:38.014
Like, really launched it, to the point
where after quitting comedy,

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:40.972
I became the most talked-about
comedian on the planet,

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:44.624
because apparently, I'm even worse
at making retirement plans

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.145
than I am at speaking my own mind.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:52.351
Now, all I've done up until this point

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.147
apart from giving over a spattering
of biographical detail

00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:58.478
is to tell you indirectly
that I have three ideas

00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:00.258
that I want to share with you today.
