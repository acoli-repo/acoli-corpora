00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.033
So I won't be changing
anything for nobody,

00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:32.213
not even TED,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:35.491
which, I will point out,
stands for three ideas:

00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:37.402
technology, entertainment

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:38.672
and dickheads.

00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.664
(Laughter)

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:43.604
Works every time, doesn't it?

00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:47.765
But you need more than just jokes

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.147
to be able to cut it
as a professional comedian.

00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.061
You need to be able to walk
that fine line between being charming

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.593
and disarming.

00:04:55.617 --> 00:05:00.990
And I discovered the most effective way
to generate the amount of charm I needed
