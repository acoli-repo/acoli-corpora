I've always had a great deal of difficulty

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.386
turning my thinking into the talking.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:07.709
So it seems a bit
of a contradiction, then,

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.154
that someone like me,
who is so bad at the chat,

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:12.910
could be something like
a stand-up comedian.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.280
But there you go. There you go.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:16.964
It's what it is.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:20.987
I first tried my hand at stand-up
comedi -- comedie ... See?

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:22.174
See? See?

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.028
(Laughter)

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:27.989
I first tried my hand at stand-up comedy

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:29.180
in my late 20s,

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:34.592
and despite being a pathologically shy
virtual mute with low self-esteem
