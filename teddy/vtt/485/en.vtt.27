00:13:37.062 --> 00:13:38.216
to shock them,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.333
so they could listen to my story
and hold my pain

00:13:42.357 --> 00:13:46.826
as individuals, not
as a mindless, laughing mob.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.393

(Applause)

00:13:57.615 --> 00:13:59.638
Now, many have argued

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:02.243
that "Nanette" is not a comedy show.
