00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:30.234
it's best to stick
with just sharing one idea.

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.429
I said no.

00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:35.919
(Laughter)

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:37.321
What would they know?

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:42.791
To explain why I have chosen to ignore
what is clearly very good advice,

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:45.356
I want to take you back
to the beginning of this talk,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.028
specifically, my palindrome joke.

00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:51.164
Now that joke uses my favorite trick
of the comedian trade,

00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:52.357
the rule of three,

00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:53.839
whereby you make a statement

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:55.383
and then back that statement up

00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:56.565
with a list.

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.220
My entire family have palindromic names:

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:02.219
Mum, Dad, Nan, Pop.
