00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:30.020
and nor is my head a static gallery
of sensibly collected think pieces.

00:09:30.044 --> 00:09:35.007
It's more that I've got this ever-evolving
language of hieroglyphics

00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:36.184
that I've developed

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:39.916
and can understand fluently
and think deeply with.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.713
but I struggle to translate.

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:45.488
I can't paint, draw, sculpt,
or even haberdash,

00:09:45.512 --> 00:09:48.303
and as for the written word,

00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:53.513
I'm OK at it but it's a tortuous
process of translation,

00:09:53.537 --> 00:09:56.302
and I don't feel it does the job.

00:09:56.326 --> 00:10:00.780
And as far as speaking my own mind,
like I said, I'm not great at it.
