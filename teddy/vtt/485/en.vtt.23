(Laughter)

00:11:31.072 --> 00:11:34.976
Diagnosis gave me a framework
on which to hang bits of me

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.488
I could never understand.

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:38.653
My misfit suddenly had a fit,

00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:41.378
and for a while, I got giddy
with a newfound confidence

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:43.420
I had in my thinking.

00:11:43.444 --> 00:11:46.579
But after Grandma died,
that confidence took a dive,

00:11:47.636 --> 00:11:51.107
because thinking is how I grieve.

00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:52.831
And in that grief of thought,

00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:55.944
I could suddenly see with so much clarity

00:11:55.968 --> 00:12:00.801
just how profoundly isolated I was
and always had been.
