00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:31.654
as it tapered to its inevitable end,

00:07:31.678 --> 00:07:34.071
I couldn't help but feel
I'd made a mistake

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:37.472
not to share such a significant
part of my life.

00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:43.105
But I also knew that
I'd missed my opportunity,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.202
and as Grandma always used to say,

00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:47.886
"Ah, well, it's all part of the soup.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.014
Too late to take the onions out now."

00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:52.390
(Laughter)

00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:53.859
And I thought about that,

00:07:53.883 --> 00:07:57.745
and I thought about how
I had to deal with too many onions

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.693
as a kid,

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:04.352
growing up gay in a state
where homosexuality was illegal.
