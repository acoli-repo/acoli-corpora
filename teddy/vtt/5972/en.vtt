00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.121
Historically, most cars have run 
on gasoline,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.788
but that doesn’t have to be
the case in the future:

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:16.663
other liquid fuels and electricity
can also power cars.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:19.954
So what are the differences 
between these options?

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:21.746
And which one’s best?

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:24.704
Gasoline is refined from crude oil,

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.746
a fossil fuel extracted
from deep underground.

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:32.746
The energy in gasoline comes from a class
of molecules called hydrocarbons.
