00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.359
At its most basic, obesity is caused
by energy imbalance.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.135
If the energy input from calories

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.574
is greater than the energy output
from physical activity,

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:10.286
the body stores the extra calories as fat.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:14.455
In most cases, this imbalance comes
from a combination of circumstances

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:16.479
and choices.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:21.113
Adults should be getting at least
2.5 hours of exercise each week,

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:23.756
and children a whole hour per day.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:28.133
But globally, one in four adults
and eight out of ten adolescents

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.856
aren't active enough.
