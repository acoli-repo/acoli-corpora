00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:00.855
By the mid 19th century, being excessively
overweight, or obese,

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:04.108
was recognized as a cause of ill health,

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:07.487
and another century later, 
declared deadly.

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:12.399
What is the distinction between being
overweight and being obese?

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.648
A calculation called the BMI
breaks it down for us.

00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:20.079
For example, if someone weighs
65 kilgorams

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.792
and is 1.5 meters tall,

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.226
they have a BMI of about 29.

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:29.110
Obesity is a condition of excess body fat

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.985
that occurs when a person's BMI
is above 30,
