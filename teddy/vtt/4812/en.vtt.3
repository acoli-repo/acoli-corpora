just over the overweight range
of 25 to 29.9.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.010
While BMI can be a helpful estimate
of healthy weight,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.257
actual body fat percentage can only
really be determined

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:47.974
by also considering information
like waist circumference

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.859
and muscle mass.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.203
Athletes, for instance, have a naturally

00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.359
At its most basic, obesity is caused
by energy imbalance.
