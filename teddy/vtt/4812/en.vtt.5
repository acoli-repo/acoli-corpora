00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:33.474
Calorie-dense processed foods
and growing portion sizes

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.516
coupled with pervasive marketing

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:38.043
lead to passive overeating.

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:39.383
And scarce resources,

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:42.418
and a lack of access to healthy,
affordable foods

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:46.579
creates an even greater risk
in disadvantaged communities.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.443
Yet, our genetic makeup also plays a part.

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:51.854
Studies on families and on separated twins

00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:56.351
have shown a clear causal hereditary
relationship to weight gain.

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.258
Recent studies have also found
a link between obesity

00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:04.288
and variations in the bacteria species
that live in our digestive systems.
