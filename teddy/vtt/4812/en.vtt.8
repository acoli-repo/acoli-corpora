00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:00.165
And as people gain weight,

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:03.756
damage to signaling pathways makes it
increasingly difficult

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:07.165
for the brain to measure food intake
and fat storage.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:08.759
There is, however, some evidence

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.757
that well-monitored, 
long-term changes in behavior

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:15.701
can lead to improvements 
in obesity-related health issues.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:18.418
And weight loss from sustained 
lifestyle changes,

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:21.163
or invasive treatments 
like bariatric surgery,

00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:25.069
can improve insulin resistance
and decrease inflammation.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.611
What was once an advantage for survival
is now working against us.

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.415
As the world's population continues
to slow down and get bigger,
