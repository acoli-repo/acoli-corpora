00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how to empower them, how to save them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Not me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
are saving us.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a future that defies and blurs
