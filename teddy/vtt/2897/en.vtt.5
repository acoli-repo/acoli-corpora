00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.616
your liver might use an olfactory receptor

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.816
to chemically detect
the change in concentration

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.079
of a chemical floating
through your bloodstream.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.496
Many cell types and tissues in the body
use chemical sensors,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.016
or chemosensors,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.016
to keep track of the concentration
of hormones, metabolites

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.496
and other molecules,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.320
and some of these chemosensors
are olfactory receptors.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.176
If you are a pancreas or a kidney

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.016
and you need a specialized chemical sensor
