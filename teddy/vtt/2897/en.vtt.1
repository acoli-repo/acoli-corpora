00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
but your nose has the molecular
machinery to make it happen.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.736
Olfactory receptors --

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.696
tiny scent detectors --

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.656
are packed into your nose,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.096
each one patiently waiting
to be activated by the odor,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.416
or ligand,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.280
that it's been assigned to detect.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.616
It turns out we humans,
like all vertebrates,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.240
have lots of olfactory receptors.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.536
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted
to genes for different olfactory receptors

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.880
than for any other type of protein.
