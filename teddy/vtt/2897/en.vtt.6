00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.016
and you need a specialized chemical sensor

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.616
that will allow you to keep track
of a specific molecule,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.240
why reinvent the wheel?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.376
One of the first examples

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.336
of an olfactory receptor
found outside the nose

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.640
showed that human sperm
express an olfactory receptor,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.696
and that sperm with this receptor
will seek out the chemical

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.656
that the receptor responds to --

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.336
the receptor's ligand.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.760
That is, the sperm
will swim toward the ligand.
