Here's a question for you:

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.576
how many different scents
do you think you can smell,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.520
and maybe even identify with accuracy?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.000
100?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
300?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.280
1,000?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.256
One study estimates that humans can
detect up to one trillion different odors.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.896
A trillion.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.736
It's hard to imagine,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
but your nose has the molecular
machinery to make it happen.
