00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.696
However, about a year or so later,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.216
a report emerged of an olfactory
receptor expressed in a tissue

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.336
other than the nose.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.016
And then another such report emerged,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.240
and another.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.936
We now know that these receptors
are found all over the body,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320
including in some pretty
unexpected places --

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.536
in muscle,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.136
in kidneys,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.696
lungs

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.496
and blood vessels.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.680
But what are they doing there?
