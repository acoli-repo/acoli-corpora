00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.136
to chemicals called
short-chain fatty acids

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.976
that are produced by the bacteria
that reside in your gut --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.520
your gut microbiota.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.536
After being produced
by your gut microbiota,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.376
these chemicals are absorbed
into your bloodstream

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.496
where they can then
interact with receptors

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.536
like olfactory receptor 78,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.416
meaning that the changes
in metabolism of your gut microbiota

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.000
may influence your blood pressure.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.136
Although we've identified a number
of different olfactory and taste receptors
