This has intriguing implications.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.456
Are sperm aided in finding the egg

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.120
by sniffing out the area
with the highest ligand concentration?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.936
I like this example
because it clearly demonstrates

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.256
that an olfactory receptor's primary job
is to be a chemical sensor,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.176
but depending on the context,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.896
it can influence how you perceive a smell,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.520
or in which direction sperm will swim,
