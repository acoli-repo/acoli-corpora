00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.880
than for any other type of protein.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.519
Why is that?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.936
Could olfactory receptors
be doing something else

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.160
in addition to allowing us to smell?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.896
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel
uncovered the molecular identity

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.416
of olfactory receptors --

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.600
work which ultimately
led to a Nobel Prize.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.776
At the time,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.600
we all assumed that these receptors
were only found in the nose.
