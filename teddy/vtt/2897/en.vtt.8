or in which direction sperm will swim,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.896
and as it turns out,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.240
a huge variety of other processes.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.936
Olfactory receptors have been
implicated in muscle cell migration,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.976
in helping the lung to sense
and respond to inhaled chemicals,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.560
and in wound healing.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.016
Similarly, taste receptors once thought
to be found only in the tongue,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.040
are now known to be expressed
in cells and tissues throughout the body.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.336
Even more surprisingly,
