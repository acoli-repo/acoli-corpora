00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.856
a recent study found

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.440
that the light receptors in our eyes
also play a role in our blood vessels.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.056
In my lab,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.536
we work on trying to understand the roles
of olfactory receptors and taste receptors

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.840
in the context of the kidney.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.856
The kidney is a central
control center for homeostasis.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.096
And to us,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.896
it makes sense that a homeostatic
control center would be a logical place

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.960
to employ chemical sensors.
