(Applause)

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.280
Along with my brother, 
I studied all over the world.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.040
When we are younger
everyone reads comics; I did too.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.720
They were all Western comics

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.040
like Tarzan, Superman, Spiderman, 
all action heroes,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.440
super heroes, big, huge, muscular …

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.720
There were no Hindi comics,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.640
but there was one which I really liked.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.600
It was Chacha Chaudhary.
