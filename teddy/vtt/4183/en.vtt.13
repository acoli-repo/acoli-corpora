00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.640
The last thing that I want to say

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.160
is that when I met Ashrafi and
then could never meet her again,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.840
I realized that the truth is that 
each of us has an Ashrafi in our lives

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.000
so it’s very important that 
you spend time

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.740
with them and learn from them.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.650
They will soon be gone,
and their stories will leave, too.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.440
(Applause)

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.260
Thank you.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.220
(Applause)

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.480
SRK: Thank you, Mr. Samar Jodha,
for coming here

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.700
and sharing such delightful
things with us.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.820
I will make a call on behalf of Samar.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.800
I now ask people to share 
with Samar Jodha,
