00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.600
It was Chacha Chaudhary.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.960
But the one thing I did not understand was:

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.640
Why was Chacha Chaudhary short, 
old and walking with the help of a stick?

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.600
Why wasn’t he a superstar 
like those in Western comics?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.400
I went to meet Pran, who lived in Delhi

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.480
and had developed the character 
Chacha Chaudhary.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.200
He told me a wonderful thing:

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.040
that in our culture we believe that 
as a person grows older,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800
he gains in experience,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.000
he has seen the highs and lows of life,
has risen and fallen.
