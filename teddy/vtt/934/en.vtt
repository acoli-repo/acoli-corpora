00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I got invited to speak to the people

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to perform at sporting events.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Unfortunately I couldn't go.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But it got me thinking about

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the fact that these guys, at least most of them,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
know what it is that they do for a living.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What they do is they dress up

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Shortly after that I got invited

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to speak at the convention of the people
