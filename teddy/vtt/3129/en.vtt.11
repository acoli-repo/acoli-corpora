if you didn't live there.

00:05:31.274 --> 00:05:33.820
Poletown was home
to an incredibly resourceful,

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:37.539
incredibly intelligent
and incredibly resilient community.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:43.200
It was there I first experienced
the power of radical neighborliness.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:46.509
During the year I worked
on my house before moving in,

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.001
I lived in a microcommunity
inside Poletown,

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.741
founded by a wild and virtuous farmer
named Paul Weertz.

00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:56.032
Paul was a teacher
in a Detroit public school

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.835
for pregnant and parenting mothers,

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.928
and his idea was to teach
the young women to raise their children
