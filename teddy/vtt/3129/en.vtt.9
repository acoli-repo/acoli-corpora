00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.087
Just a 15-minute bike ride
from the baseball stadium downtown,

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.647
the neighborhood was positively rural.

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:40.484
What houses were left looked like
cardboard boxes left in the rain;

00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:43.501
two-story monstrosities
with wide-open shells

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:44.898
and melted porches.

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:48.915
One of the most striking things
I remember were the rosebushes,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.166
forgotten and running wild
over tumbled-down fences,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.119
no longer cared for by anyone.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:58.499
This was my house on the day
I boarded it up

00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:00.887
to protect it from the elements
and further decay.
