00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:05.954
leaving some estimates as high
as 40 square miles of abandoned land --

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:07.875
about the size of San Francisco.

00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:13.938
Aside from platitudes such as the vague
and agentless "deindustrialization,"

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:16.859
Detroit's exodus can be summed up
with two structures:

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:18.730
freeways and walls.

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:20.814
The freeways,

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:23.395
coupled with massive
governmental subsidies

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.037
for the suburbs via
infrastructure and home loans,

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.653
allowed people to leave the city at will,

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:33.392
taking with it tax base,
jobs and education dollars.
