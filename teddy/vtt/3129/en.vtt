In 2009, I bought a house
in Detroit for 500 dollars.

00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:09.652
It had no windows,
no plumbing, no electricity

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.117
and it was filled with trash.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:16.297
The first floor held nearly
10,000 pounds of garbage,

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.164
and that included the better part
of a Dodge Caravan,

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:21.466
cut into chunks with a reciprocating saw.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.685
(Laughter)

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.879
I lived nearly two years without heat,

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:28.387
woke up out of a dead sleep
multiple times to gunshots,

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.447
was attacked by a pack of wild dogs
