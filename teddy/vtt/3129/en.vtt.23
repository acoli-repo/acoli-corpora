00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:30.352
none of us can truly be comfortable,

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:32.108
until our neighbors are, too.

00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:34.714
For those of us coming in,

00:11:34.738 --> 00:11:37.733
it means we must make sure
we aren't inadvertently contributing

00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:39.966
to the destruction of community again,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.141
and to follow the lead

00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:44.156
of those who have been working
on these problems for years.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.182
In Detroit, that means average citizens
deputizing themselves

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:51.883
to create water stations and deliveries
for those who have lost access to it.

00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:55.125
Or clergy and teachers
engaging in civil disobedience

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:56.896
to block water shutoff trucks.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.286
It's organizations buying back
foreclosed homes for their inhabitants
