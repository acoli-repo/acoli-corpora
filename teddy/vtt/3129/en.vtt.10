00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:00.887
to protect it from the elements
and further decay.

00:05:01.344 --> 00:05:04.617
I eventually purchased it
from the county in a live auction.

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:06.452
I'd assumed the neighborhood was dead.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:09.201
That I was some kind of pioneer.

00:05:10.223 --> 00:05:12.110
Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:14.050
I was in no way a pioneer,

00:05:14.074 --> 00:05:16.541
and would come to understand
how offensive that is.

00:05:17.844 --> 00:05:21.582
One of the first things I learned
was to add my voice to the chorus,

00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:23.581
not overwrite what was already happening.

00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:26.699
(Voice breaking) Because
the neighborhood hadn't died.

00:05:26.723 --> 00:05:29.503
It had just transformed in a way
that was difficult to see

00:05:29.527 --> 00:05:30.845
if you didn't live there.
