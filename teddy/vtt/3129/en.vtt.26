If we can do it in Detroit,

00:13:01.203 --> 00:13:03.111
you can do it wherever you're from, too.

00:13:04.094 --> 00:13:06.006
What I've learned over the last decade,

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.933
building my house,

00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:10.944
wasn't so much about wiring
or plumbing or carpentry --

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:13.622
although I did learn these things --

00:13:13.646 --> 00:13:16.641
is that true change, real change,

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:18.472
starts first with community,

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:21.705
with a radical sense
of what it means to be a neighbor.

00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:25.633
It turned at least one
abandoned house into a home.

00:13:26.234 --> 00:13:27.385
Thank you.
