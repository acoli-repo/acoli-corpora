00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.447
was attacked by a pack of wild dogs

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.147
and ripped my kitchen cabinets
from an abandoned school

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.095
as they were actively tearing
that school down.

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:43.683
This, of course, is the Detroit
that your hear about.

00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:45.316
Make no mistake, it's real.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.737
But there's another Detroit, too.

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.829
Another Detroit that's more hopeful,

00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:52.144
more innovative,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:54.319
and may just provide some of the answers

00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:57.292
to cities struggling to reinvent
themselves everywhere.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:02.877
These answers, however, do not
necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom
