00:03:58.084 --> 00:04:00.656
Because grants and loans
weren't available to everyone,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.990
I decided I was going
to do this without them

00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:04.897
and that I would wage my personal fight

00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:08.338
against the city that had loomed
over my childhood with power tools.

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:12.849
I eventually found an abandoned house
in a neighborhood called Poletown.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.834
It looked like the apocalypse
had descended.

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:18.268

A huge, open expanse of waist-high grass

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:24.848
cluttered only by a handful
of crippled, abandoned structures

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:27.022
and a few brave holdouts
with well-kept homes.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.087
Just a 15-minute bike ride
from the baseball stadium downtown,
