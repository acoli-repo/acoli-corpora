These answers, however, do not
necessarily adhere to conventional wisdom

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:04.304
about good development.

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:09.708
I think Detroit's real strength
boils down to two words:

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:11.850
radical neighborliness.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.287
And I wasn't able to see it myself
until I lived there.

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:17.835
About a decade ago,

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.382
I moved to Detroit with no friends,
no job and no money,

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.597
at a time when it seemed
like everyone else was moving out.

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.352
Between 2000 and 2010,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:30.087
25 percent of the city's population left.
