00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:32.783
In a neighborhood where many blocks
now only hold one or two houses,

00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:35.035
all the homes on Paul's block stand.

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.631

showing me Detroit
wasn't just black and white,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.842
and diversity could flourish
when it's encouraged.

00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:02.762
Each year, neighbors assemble to bale hay
for the farm animals on the block,
