00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:02.762
Each year, neighbors assemble to bale hay
for the farm animals on the block,

00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:05.992
teaching me just how much
a small group of people can get done

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:07.707
when they work together,

00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:12.133
and the magnetism of fantastical
yet practical ideas.

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.322
Radical neighborliness is every house
behind Paul's block burning down,

00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:20.578
and instead of letting it fill up
with trash and despair,

00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:23.929
Paul and the surrounding community
creating a giant circular garden

00:07:23.953 --> 00:07:27.607
ringed with dozens of fruit trees,
beehives and garden plots

00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:29.433
for anyone that wants one,

00:07:29.457 --> 00:07:32.536
helping me see that our challenges
can often be assets.
