It's organizations buying back
foreclosed homes for their inhabitants

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.652
or fighting misinformation
on forced sales through social media

00:12:04.676 --> 00:12:06.504
and volunteer-run hotlines.

00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:09.865
For me, it means helping others
to raise the beams

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:12.107
on their own formerly abandoned houses,

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.318
or helping to educate
those with privilege,

00:12:14.342 --> 00:12:16.326
now increasingly moving into cities,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.479
how we might come in and support

00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:20.778
rather than stress existing communities.

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:23.672
It's chipping in when
a small group of neighbors decides

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:25.493
to buy back a foreclosed home

00:12:25.517 --> 00:12:27.671
and return the deeds to the occupants.

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:30.957
And for you, for all of us,
