00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that the only way for us to teach creativity

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is by teaching children perspectives

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
at the earliest stage.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And conversely,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
only when you teach perspectives

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
will a child be able to imagine

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and put themselves in the shoes

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of someone who is different from them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm making an argument that art and creativity

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
are very essential tools in empathy.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You know, I can't promise my child

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
a life without bias --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we're all biased --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
