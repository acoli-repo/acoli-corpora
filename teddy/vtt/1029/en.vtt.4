00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Babri Masjid --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
one of the most beautiful mosques in India,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
was demolished by Hindu activists.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This caused major riots in my city.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And for the first time,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I was affected

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
by this communal unrest.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My little five-year-old kid neighbor

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
comes running in,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and he says, "Rags, Rags.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He's like, "Huh!"
