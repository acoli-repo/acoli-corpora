Hi everyone.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I want to share with you my latest art project.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's a children's book for the iPad.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a little quirky and silly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's called "Pop-It,"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Music)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this is about potty training --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as most of you, I hope, know.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can tickle the rug.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can make the baby poop.
