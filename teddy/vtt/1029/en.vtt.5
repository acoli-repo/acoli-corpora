00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He's like, "Huh!"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You know, my work is inspired

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
by events such as this.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Even in my gallery shows,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I try and revisit historic events

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
like Babri Masjid,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
distill only its emotional residue

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and image my own life.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Imagine history being taught differently.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Remember that children's book

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I have another idea.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It's a children's book about Indian independence --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
very patriotic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
