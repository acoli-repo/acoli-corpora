00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can make the baby poop.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You can do all those fun things.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can burst bubbles.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can draw, as everyone should.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But you know, I have a problem with children's books:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I think they're full of propaganda.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not the way I was brought up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you notice carefully,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You don't like it?
