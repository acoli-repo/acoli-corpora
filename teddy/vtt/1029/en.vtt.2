it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You don't like it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I have to tell you about my childhood.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I went to this very proper Christian school

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and I am.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which was probably the only Hindu house
