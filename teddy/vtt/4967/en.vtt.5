00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:32.468
But the mere thought of networking
can stop us in our tracks.

00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:36.149
This was true in one experiment
where some people were asked

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:38.522
to think about making friends
at a cocktail party,

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:41.796
while others imagined
trying to make professional connections.

00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:45.577
Afterward, the ones who'd envisioned
networking felt dirty,

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.391
to the point that they actually rated
soap and toothpaste more positively.

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:53.323
And research shows that no one
really mixes at mixers, anyway.

00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:55.228
We might plan to meet new people,

00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:58.131
but we usually end up
hanging out with our old friends.

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:01.471
So how should you think
about developing your network?
