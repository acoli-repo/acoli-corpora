00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:31.338
And Kat did.

00:13:31.927 --> 00:13:35.371
For her, the "give first" approach
started back when she was 19,

00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:37.260
working as a Hooters waitress.

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.276
She pitched in to help a lot.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.050
KC: If someone wanted to go home,
I picked up their shift.

00:13:42.074 --> 00:13:43.743
Or if a manager called and said,

00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:45.807
"Look, I'm having trouble
in my restaurant,

00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:46.989
can you come and help?"

00:13:47.013 --> 00:13:48.172
I worked.

00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:51.276
AG: So Kat turned helping
into an opportunity to build her skills

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.951
and demonstrate her contributions.

00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:56.737
KC: The cooks had quit one day, and so
I learned how to cook in the restaurant.

00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:59.608
The bartender had to go home,
and I learned how to bartend.

00:13:59.632 --> 00:14:02.927
And that kept happening with all of these
support and leadership roles
