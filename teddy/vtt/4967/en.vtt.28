00:13:59.632 --> 00:14:02.927
And that kept happening with all of these
support and leadership roles

00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:04.102
in the business,

00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:06.982
where, over the course of maybe 90 days,

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:11.146
I had built this résumé of knowing
how to run a restaurant.

00:14:11.487 --> 00:14:14.232
It was not my intention;
I was just trying to be helpful.

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:18.152
And all of that led to me
being considered a top employee.

00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:20.073
AG: Which led to her first big break.

00:14:20.097 --> 00:14:22.438
KC: I was asked to be a part
of the training team

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:26.882
to go open the first ever
of our franchises in Sydney, Australia.

00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:30.135
AG: Kat had been
at the company just two years.
