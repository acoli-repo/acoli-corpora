AG: The best network isn't always built
where the people are the most influential.

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:13.309
It's in the places where
you can be the most influential,

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:15.776
where you can stand out
with your contributions.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.760
So instead of choosing
the most prestigious organization,

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.609
you might end up with a better network

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:23.553
at the organization that does
the most promotions from within

00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:26.989
or that's growing the fastest,
where you can progress the quickest.
