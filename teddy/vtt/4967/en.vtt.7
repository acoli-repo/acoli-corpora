00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:31.411
and I thought, "I'm going to lose her,
so I should call her every day."

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:35.070
So this is 1992, I had to have
this bag of quarters every day,

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:36.380
going to a pay phone.

00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:38.896
And it was like three,
four dollars per minute.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.761
So I had spent the whole 700 dollars
in, like, two, three weeks.

AG: He started working
in a California car wash

00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:49.617
and then in a yogurt shop,
where he lived in the attic to save money.

00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:53.403
PN: You couldn't walk, stand up,
because it was short, no air, no window.

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:55.815
AG: One night, while watching
a Persian TV channel,

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.044
he saw an ad for a high-end rug gallery.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.780
Within a couple days,

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:02.288
he visited the shop
and talked his way into a job.
