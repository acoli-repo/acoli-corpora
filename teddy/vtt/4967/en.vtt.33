00:16:29.744 --> 00:16:33.061
but then I would make sure
I was in the room to help present it:

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.299
"I took the notes,
and this is what I observed.

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:37.727
And here's a question
I think we should be asking."

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:39.958
The menial task, if you will,

00:16:39.982 --> 00:16:43.593
was always the first step in something.

00:16:43.617 --> 00:16:45.426
It was never the thing.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.645
Neha Shah: If you're just
doing the grunt work,

00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:49.373
then I think it become thankless.

00:16:49.397 --> 00:16:51.478
And if you're not learning
anything from it,

00:16:51.502 --> 00:16:53.701
I think that's where
the boundary condition is:

00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.274
Where is that learning stopping?

00:16:55.298 --> 00:16:57.506
AG: That's Neha Shah,
a researcher at Microsoft

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.578
who specializes in social
networks at work.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.482
NS: Informal networks, so it's different
than the organizational chart.
