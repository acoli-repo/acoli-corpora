So how should you think
about developing your network?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.830
You don't have to start
by building your contact list.

00:03:04.854 --> 00:03:07.386
You can start by building your skills,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.037
because having expertise to share

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.522
sets you up to connect
with interesting people.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:12.696
Just ask Pejman.

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:15.100
Pejman Nozad: My name is Pejman Nozad.

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:19.347
I landed three miles from here,
San Carlos, with 700 dollars in my pocket.

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:22.050
AG: When he came to the US
from Iran in the 1990s,

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:23.500
he barely knew anyone.

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:24.920
PN: I didn't know what to do.

00:03:24.944 --> 00:03:28.029
I think the only thing I knew,
I was in love with a girl in Iran,

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:31.411
and I thought, "I'm going to lose her,
so I should call her every day."
