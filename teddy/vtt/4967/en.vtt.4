It's not what you know, it's who you know.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.485
Like most clichés,

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.371
it's popular because it highlights
an important truth.

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:18.061
But it's partially false.

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:22.326
Look, there's no doubt
that who you know matters.

00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:24.014
We have decades of evidence

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:27.109
that the right connection can get
your foot in the door for jobs,

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:28.839
promotions and board seats.

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:32.468
But the mere thought of networking
can stop us in our tracks.
