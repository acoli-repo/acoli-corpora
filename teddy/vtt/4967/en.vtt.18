00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.561
and I'm a host of
the "Masters of Scale" podcast.

00:09:00.585 --> 00:09:04.541
AG: Reid spent a huge part of his career
helping people build better networks.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:07.271
And he's a believer
in doing things Pejman's way:

00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:10.366
connecting with people over something
deeper than self-interest.

00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:13.112
In fact, he's identified
four different mindsets

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.537
that people have when making connections.

00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:17.536
The first two are transactional.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.994
RH: The bottom level is,
it's an immediate trade.

00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:24.226
The second is like, "I'll do this for you,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.094
and then you're going to do
something for me in the future,"

00:09:27.118 --> 00:09:29.339
which is that kind of narrow transaction.

00:09:29.363 --> 00:09:32.797
AG: A more meaningful approach
is to focus on building a real connection.
