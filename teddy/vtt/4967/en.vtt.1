00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:31.941
and he turns it over to, like,
look if there was a ring.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.022
Almost threw up on his shoes.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.291
Constantinos Coutifaris:
So I spotted this managing director.

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:40.617
I sort of crossed the room
and entered his peripheral vision.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.447
And he immediately turned to me

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.831
and asked me if I could get him
another glass of merlot.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.061
AG: And even if you get
the meeting you want,

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:50.108
it doesn't always go as planned.

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:52.392
Reb Rebele: I was halfway
through a conversation

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.449
with somebody I was really
excited to meet,

00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:56.298
and I thought things were going great,

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.696
but he said he was only
at about a three out of 10

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.134
in terms of how engaged he was
in the conversation.
