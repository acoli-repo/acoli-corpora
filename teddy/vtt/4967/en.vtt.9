Pejman was selling rugs
in Silicon Valley in the early 90s,

00:04:31.274 --> 00:04:33.441
right as the internet boom was happening,

00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:36.338
which gave him a chance to meet
some pretty important people.

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:39.442
PN: My customers are, you know,
founder, CEO of a tech company,

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.491
venture capitalists, lawyers, bankers,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.291
and I built a close
relationship with them.

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:47.871
AG: He built these relationships
talking about rugs all day long,

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:51.482
sharing his insights in a showroom,
much like the one he owns today,

00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:53.681
in a historic garden in Silicon Valley.

00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:55.262
PN: Hello!

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:57.572
AG: Oh, wow. There are rugs on the rugs.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.500
PN: This is kind of a directional carpet,
as you can see it up there.
