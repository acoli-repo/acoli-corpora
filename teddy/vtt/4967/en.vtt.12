You love having mavens in your network:

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.045
knowing who to call
when you're deciding which car to buy,

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.752
being able to email someone
who's lived in nine countries

00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:07.545
when you're planning your next trip,

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.497
having an eagle-eyed proofreader available
to check your work for errors.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:14.918
For Pejman, his knowledge
about rugs led him to meet

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:17.632
a particularly pivotal
person in his career

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:21.029
after an ordinary call from a customer
who needed a rug cleaned.

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:23.827
Lou Montulli: In fact, it was
kind of an interesting story,

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.660
because I was an angry rug customer.

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:27.926
(Laughter)

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.117
AG: The customer's name is Lou Montulli.
