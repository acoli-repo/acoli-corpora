AG: In my research,

00:13:00.797 --> 00:13:04.374
I found that givers have stronger
relationships and reputations than takers,

00:13:04.398 --> 00:13:06.509
who burn bridges with their selfishness.

00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:08.447
Givers also fare better than matchers --

00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:12.905
people who trade favors quid pro quo,
and come across as pretty transactional

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:14.884
because they're always keeping score.

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:18.483
A number of studies show
that people who give more than they get

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:20.594
earn more status and social capital.

00:13:20.618 --> 00:13:24.134
But you can't try to game this strategy
by giving only for show.

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.172
If you help me just to get something,

00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.228
it feels like you were just using me.

00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:29.708
You have to actually care.
