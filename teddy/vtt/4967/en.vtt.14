00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.172
turned out to be tens of thousands
of dollars spent on a new carpet.

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:02.664
LM: Let's not talk about it.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:03.895

because he excelled at his job.

00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.736
He impressed Lou with his expertise.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.442
