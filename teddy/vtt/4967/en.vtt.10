00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.500
PN: This is kind of a directional carpet,
as you can see it up there.

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:03.278
The way you recognize this carpet

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.251
is because of that purple band
on the right side.

00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:08.687
It's among the signature pieces here.

00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.212
AG: He'd show off his knowledge

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:12.956
and teach customers something
about what they were buying.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.044
And often, he ended up having
these conversations in their homes.

00:05:16.068 --> 00:05:17.731
PN: Persian carpets are expensive;

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:20.067
you don't sell them
normally at the gallery.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:23.386
And when you go to their home,
you spend a couple of hours with them.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.278
I was hanging out with them,

00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:27.736
with their family
at the dinner table, and so on.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.593
AG: Pejman loved to share his insights

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:32.457
about the deep history
and craftsmanship of rugs.
