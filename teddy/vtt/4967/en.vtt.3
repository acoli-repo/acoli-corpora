00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:32.362
I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.857
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.915
I study how to make work not suck.

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:39.485
In this show,

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.134
I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:46.467
because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.531
Today: making professional connections

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.165
and how to build a great network
even if you hate networking.

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.661
