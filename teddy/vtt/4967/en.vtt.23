And there, she figured out
how to make deeper connections faster

00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:34.911
than asking what people did
or who they worked for.

00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:37.418
KC: So I would go to these things,

00:11:37.442 --> 00:11:39.268
but instead of speed-dating --

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:42.419
How many cards can I collect?
How many cards can I dish out? --

00:11:42.443 --> 00:11:46.890
I would have more focused
conversations with one or two.

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:50.755
And the conversations wouldn't be
about "What do you do?"

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:54.247
They would be centered around
"What's your biggest challenge?"

00:11:54.271 --> 00:11:57.519
and then sharing a story
that I felt would be helpful.

00:11:57.543 --> 00:12:02.242
So it was almost that I found a way
to try to be a mini-helper in the moment.
