00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:03.857
Adam Grant: The idea of networking
has always made me a little uncomfortable.

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.111
I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:10.045
Kat Cole: It all started with pretty
aggressive business card swapping.

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.195
"That's what I need to do;
I need to walk up and introduce myself,

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.471
and, 'Here's my business card,'
and get theirs."

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:16.746
AG: That makes me nervous.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.605
And it makes my students nervous, too,

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.617
because we all know
the results can be ... awkward.

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:24.473
Allie Miller: I was at this
tech conference, met a VP.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:27.839
He reached out his left hand
to shake my left hand,

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:31.941
and he turns it over to, like,
look if there was a ring.
