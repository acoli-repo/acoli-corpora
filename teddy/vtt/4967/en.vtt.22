00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.343
on a food budget
of just 10 dollars a week.

00:11:02.823 --> 00:11:06.452
As the oldest, Kat did whatever she could
to support her family.

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:10.244
KC: I was working in malls selling clothes

00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:12.686
and helping to take care
of my sisters from school,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:17.640
and then became a hostess
and a waitress, as many people do.

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:21.640
What was different is, I was a hostess
and waitress at Hooters restaurants.

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:23.846
AG: Kat started to get
promoted at Hooters.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.304
And as she did, she started
going to industry events

00:11:26.328 --> 00:11:28.990
to learn from others
in the restaurant business.

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:32.228
And there, she figured out
how to make deeper connections faster
