00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.442
Remember -- Lou was calling
to get a rug cleaned,

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:33.593
and Pejman managed to make him
so curious about rugs

00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:35.671
that Lou ended up becoming a collector.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.355
Over the years,
their relationship blossomed,

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:42.583
to the point that when Pejman started
his own venture capital fund, Pear VC,

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:43.801
Lou offered to help out.

00:07:44.204 --> 00:07:46.671
He became an adviser and an investor.

00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:49.691
And the support didn't just flow
in one direction.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.466
When you build a network
by making deep connections

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.164
based on the sharing of knowledge,

00:07:54.188 --> 00:07:55.936
the benefits are often reciprocal.

00:07:56.466 --> 00:07:59.474
Recently, when Lou was ready
to start a new company of his own,

00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:01.752
things came full circle
for him and Pejman.
