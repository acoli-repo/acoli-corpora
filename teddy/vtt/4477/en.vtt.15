00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now this is doubly ironic

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
when you consider that what gives comedy its edge

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
at reaching around people's walls

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
where you think it's going over here

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And there's this mental delight

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that's followed by the physical response of laughter,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which, not coincidentally,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
releases endorphins in the brain.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And just like that, you've been seduced

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
into a different way of looking at something

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.
