he got a request from the Green Party in Australia

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
who used it in their campaign

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
where it became part of the debate

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that resulted in the Australian parliament

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
of any country in the world.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Applause)

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That is a lot of punch

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
for 14 words.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So my suggestion to those of you out here

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
who are seriously focused on creating a better world

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
is to take a little bit of time each day

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and practice thinking funny,
