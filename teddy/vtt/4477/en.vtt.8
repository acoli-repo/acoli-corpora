00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and transforms it through ridicule

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
into a different way of seeing

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and ultimately being in the world.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Because that's what I take

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That it's about communication

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that doesn't just produce greater understanding

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
within the individual,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but leads to real change.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Which in my experience means communication

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that manages to speak to and expand

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
our concept of self-interest.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
because we're all wired for that.
