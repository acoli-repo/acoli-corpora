00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Which struck me as particularly remarkable

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
during one session with the novel

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
when I realized that I was being swept along

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on this remarkable, vivid journey

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in translation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now I was a comparative literature major in college,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is like an English major,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we got to read great literature in translation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
from around the world.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And as great as these books were,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you could always tell

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that you were getting close to the full effect.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But not so with Márquez

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
who once praised his translator's versions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as being better than his own,
