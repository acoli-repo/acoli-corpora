00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from other forms of language.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'd say it falls somewhere

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
between poetry and lies.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And I'm not talking about all comedy here,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because, clearly, there's plenty of humor

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What I want to talk about

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
comedy as the philosopher's stone.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and transforms it through ridicule
