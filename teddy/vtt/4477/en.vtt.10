00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now if you think back

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Sarah Palin,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they were devastating.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
cementing an impression

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that the majority of the American public still holds today.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the key detail of this

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and they weren't written by the SNL writers.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
They were lifted verbatim

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
from Palin's own remarks.
