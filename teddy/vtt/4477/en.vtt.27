00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
(Laughter)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But back in 2009,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the question Joel and I kept turning over and over

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
was why this late in the game

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
so much energy was being spent talking about the science

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
when the policies necessary to address climate change

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
regardless of the science.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
