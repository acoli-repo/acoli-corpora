00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the larger point remains

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that Stewart's material

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
not because his intent is to inform. It's not.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
His intent is to be funny.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
doesn't work unless the facts are true.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the result is great comedy

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that's also an information delivery system

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
than the professional news media.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now this is doubly ironic
