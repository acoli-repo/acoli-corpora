00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
this elegantly simple insight:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
"Every act of communication

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is an act of translation."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but for me,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as often as I'd encountered

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that exact difficulty on a daily basis,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in so crystalline a light.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Ever since I can remember

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
thinking consciously about such things,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
communication has been my central passion.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Even as a child,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life
