00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it's amazing how quickly you'll discover

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
both ice and the firing squad.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Finally, after about 10 years

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of alienating friends and strangers alike,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I finally got it,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a new personal truth all my own,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the ideas that I was gaining,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'd better find a different way of going about it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And that's when I discovered comedy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from other forms of language.
