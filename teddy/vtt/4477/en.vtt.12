00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The description perfectly captured

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Edwards' personal vanity.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And guess what?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That ended up being the exact personality trait

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is by far the most --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Applause)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)
