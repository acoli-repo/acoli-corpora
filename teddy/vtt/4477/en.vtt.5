00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
ever more aware of how unobtainable

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the first part of my childhood ambition was,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it's amazing how quickly you'll discover
