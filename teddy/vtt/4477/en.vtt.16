00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
This is the exact opposite

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000

race, religion, politics, sexuality --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we get endorphins

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,
