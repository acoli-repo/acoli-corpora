00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
for the Republican presidential nomination,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
at the same time that 250

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
out of 254 counties in the state of Texas

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
were on fire.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And Perry's policy solution

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
was to ask the people of Texas

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to pray for rain.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Personally, I was praying for four more fires

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
so we could finally complete the damn science.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
(Laughter)
