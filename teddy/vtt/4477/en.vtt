Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for his storytelling,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but even more, I think,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the beauty and precision of his prose.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or the fantastical stream of consciousness

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in "Autumn of the Patriarch,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where the words rush by,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
page after page of unpunctuated imagery

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
sweeping the reader along

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like some wild river

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
twisting through a primal South American jungle,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
reading Márquez is a visceral experience.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Which struck me as particularly remarkable
