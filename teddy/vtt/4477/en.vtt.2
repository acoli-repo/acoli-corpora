00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
who once praised his translator's versions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as being better than his own,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is an astonishing compliment.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
had written his own book on the subject,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I couldn't wait to read it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000

And it's a charming read.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the translator's art.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But the reason that I mention it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is that early on, Rabassa offers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
this elegantly simple insight:
