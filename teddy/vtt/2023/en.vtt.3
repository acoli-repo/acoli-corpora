00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.175
But next to the dead duck is a live duck,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:33.489
and please pay attention.

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.979
Both are of the male sex.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.083
And then this happened.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:43.789
The live duck mounted the dead duck,

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.452
and started to copulate.

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:49.177
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.925
I said, "Something's wrong here."

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:57.897
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.779
I look. Both are of the male sex.
