00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:33.899
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.588
(Laughter)

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:40.344
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:41.917
didn't call me from Stockholm.

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.070
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.017
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:50.472
and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:52.825
held at Harvard University, and this ceremony

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:58.065
is a very nice experience.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.346
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.
