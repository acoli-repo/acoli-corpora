00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.346
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.

00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:02.759
That's the first thing.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.793
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:09.169
Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.230
who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.209
"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:20.645
under farming conditions in Britain."

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.925
(Laughter)

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.081
And I think there are one or two more

00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:31.002
Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.
