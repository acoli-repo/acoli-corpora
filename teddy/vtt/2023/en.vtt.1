00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:31.099
and this building really helped me to do my job good.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.225
The building was a true bird-killer.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.803
You may know that birds don't understand

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.965
the concept of glass. They don't see it,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.571
so they fly into the windows and get killed.

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:46.811
The only thing I had to do was go out,

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:50.868
pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.986
(Laughter)

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.765
And in those days,

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.203
I developed an ear to identify birds

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:04.789
just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.
