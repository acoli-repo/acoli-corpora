00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:03.952
I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:08.805
and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:12.488
the Ig Nobel Prize."

00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:14.402
And the Ig Nobel Prize —

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:18.819
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.838
the Ig Nobel Prize honors research

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:23.915
that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.699
with the ultimate goal to make more people

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.763
interested in science.

00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:33.899
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.
