This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.189
where I work as a curator.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.237
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:11.213
and that it grows,

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:16.565
and basically it means I collect dead animals.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:18.956
Back in 1995,

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:23.452
we got a new wing next to the museum.

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:25.593
It was made of glass,

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:31.099
and this building really helped me to do my job good.
