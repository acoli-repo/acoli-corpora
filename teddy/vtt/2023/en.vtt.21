WEBVTT

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:32.649
At five minutes to six in the afternoon,

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.563
we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:10:36.563 --> 00:10:39.202
the duck comes out of the museum,

00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:41.697
and we try to discuss new ways

00:10:41.697 --> 00:10:45.551
to prevent birds from colliding with windows.

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:47.986
And as you know, or as you may not know,

00:10:47.986 --> 00:10:50.585
this is one of the major causes of death

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.090
for birds in the world.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.961
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die

00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:58.186
in collision with glass buildings.

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:04.113
And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant
