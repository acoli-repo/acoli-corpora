is something called the sacral nerve root,

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.976
which is back here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.976
And if you trigger,
if you stimulate with an electrode,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.976
the precise spot,
you will trigger an orgasm.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.976
And it is a fact that you can trigger
spinal reflexes in dead people --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
a certain kind of dead person,
a beating-heart cadaver.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.976
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.976
legally dead, definitely checked out,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
but is being kept alive on a respirator,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.976
so that their organs will be oxygenated
for transplantation.
