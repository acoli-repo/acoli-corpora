If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.976
physicians believed that orgasm in women

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.976

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.976
Doctors back then
were routinely telling men

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.976
the importance of pleasuring their wives.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.077

00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:52.976
has a line in his book.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.064

00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:56.976
I got a lot of mileage
out of Theodoor van De Velde.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.976
He had this line in his book

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.976
that supposedly comes
from the Habsburg Monarchy,
