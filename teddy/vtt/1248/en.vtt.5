00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.976
and switched to mouthwash
for her oral care."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
It's so sad.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.077
(Laughter)

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.976
When I was working on the book,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.976
I interviewed a woman
who can think herself to orgasm.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.976
She was part of a study
at Rutgers University.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
You've got to love that. Rutgers.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.976
So I interviewed her in Oakland,
in a sushi restaurant.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.976
And I said, "So, could you
do it right here?"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.176
And she said,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.315
"Yeah, but you know I'd rather
finish my meal if you don't mind."

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.376
(Laughter)

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.976
But afterwards, she was kind enough
to demonstrate on a bench outside.
