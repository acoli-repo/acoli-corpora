Now, if you can trigger
the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.373

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:40.976
I asked this question
to a brain death expert,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.976
Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough
to return my emails.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.077
(Laughter)

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.976
I said, "So, could you conceivably
trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.667
She said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve
is being oxygenated,

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.976
you conceivably could."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.976
Obviously it wouldn't be
as much fun for the person.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.976
But it would be an orgasm --
