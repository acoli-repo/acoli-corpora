She's originally from Iraq.

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:32.627
She broke down crying.

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:35.223
"Why do they hate us?"

00:12:35.247 --> 00:12:36.421
"Who hates you?"

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.216
"Everyone; everyone hates us
because we are refugees,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.596
because we are Muslim."

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:44.355
In the past, I was able

I couldn't explain to her why someone
tried to rip off her mother's hijab

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.157
when they were grocery shopping,

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:57.425
or why a player on an opposing
team called her a terrorist

00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:59.932
and told her to go back
where she came from.

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:01.718
I couldn't reassure her
