00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.258
These kids weren't like me.

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.060
They were poor. They lived in a camp.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.424
I refused.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:07.414
She knelt down beside me
and firmly said, "Go.

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:09.592
And don't come back until you've played.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:11.656
Don't ever think people are beneath you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.979
or that you have nothing
to learn from others."

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.969
I reluctantly went.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:18.281
I never wanted to disappoint
my grandmother.

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:20.872
I returned a few hours later,

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:25.526
having spent some time playing soccer
with the kids in the camp.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.316
We walked out of the camp,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.035
and I was excitedly telling her
what a great time I had
