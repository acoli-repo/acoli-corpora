00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:30.835
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.341
"Where's Rooh? I need
to talk to him, see if he's OK."

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:37.301
"He's in his room, Coach.
He's refusing to come out."

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:38.492
I knocked on the door.

00:08:38.516 --> 00:08:40.942
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:44.017
I need to see if you're OK
or if we need to go to the hospital."

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.192
He came out.

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:47.478
He had a big gash on his head,
a split lip,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.770
and he was physically shaken.

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:51.847
I was looking at him,

00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:54.430
and I asked the boys
to call for their mom,

00:08:54.454 --> 00:08:56.866
because I needed to go
to the hospital with him.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.197
They called for their mom.

00:08:58.608 --> 00:08:59.800
She came out.
