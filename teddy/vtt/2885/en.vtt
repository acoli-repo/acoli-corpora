00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:02.842
I remember when I first found out

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.905
I was going to speak at a TED conference.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.040
I ran across the hall
to one of my classrooms

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.493
to inform my students.

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:09.765
"Guess what, guys?

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.867
I've been asked to give a TED Talk."

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:13.922
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.404
The whole room went silent.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:20.094
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one
you made us watch on grit?

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.813
Or the one with the scientist that did
this really awesome thing with robots?"

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.003
Muhammad asked.

00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:26.448
"Yes, just like that."

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:30.071
"But Coach, those people
are really important and smart."
