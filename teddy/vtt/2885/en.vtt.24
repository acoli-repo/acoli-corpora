00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.442
How much more suffering,

00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:02.511
how much more suffering must we take?

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:06.026
How many more people need to be
forced out of their homes

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.431
before we say, "Enough!"?

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:08.664
A hundred million?

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.951
Not only do we shame,
blame and reject them

00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:16.078
for atrocities that they had
absolutely nothing to do with,

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:18.167
we re-traumatize them,

00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:21.156
when we're supposed to be welcoming
them into our countries.

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.594
We strip them of their dignity
and treat them like criminals.

00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.324
I had a student in my office
a couple of weeks ago.

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:31.164
She's originally from Iraq.
