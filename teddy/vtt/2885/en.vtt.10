00:04:57.795 --> 00:05:01.067
And I don't know why it was that morning,
but when I looked outside,

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.229
I realized if I didn't leave,
my three young children would die.

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:05.642
And so we left.

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:08.670
We left because we had to,
not because we wanted to.

00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:10.442
There was no choice," she said.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.256
It's kind of hard to believe
that you belong

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.744
when you don't have a home,

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:19.774
when your country of origin rejects you
because of fear or persecution,

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:23.702
or the city that you grew up in
is completely destroyed.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:26.836
I didn't feel like I had a home.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.317
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,

00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:30.973
but I wasn't American, either.
