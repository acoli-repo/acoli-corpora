I celebrated Christmas with her family,

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.180
and she attempted to observe
Ramadan with me.

00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:36.906
I remember being very nervous
about coming out to her --

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.972
after all, she was a Southern Baptist.

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.456
I sat on the couch next to her

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.011
and I said, "Miss Sarah,
you know that I'm gay."

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.221
Her response is one
that I will never forget.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:47.914
"That's fine, honey.
Just don't be a slut."

00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:51.110
(Laughter)

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.809
(Applause)

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:59.745
I eventually moved to Atlanta,
still trying to find my home.
