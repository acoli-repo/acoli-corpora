00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.531
Never have we had numbers this high.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.676
This is the highest number
of refugees since World War II.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.187
Now, let me tell you why this issue
is so important to me.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.894
I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:47.291
I am a Muslim.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.780
I've also spent the last 12 years
of my life working with refugees.

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.246
Oh -- and I'm also gay.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.170
It makes me really popular these days.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.085
(Laughter)

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.053
But I am the daughter of a refugee.
