She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.754
saying that he was going to take care
of her once he graduated.

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:06.272
She smiled from exhaustion.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:09.704
"God is good. Life is good.
We are lucky to be here."

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:15.796
In the last two years, we have seen
an escalating anti-refugee sentiment.

00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:17.438
It's global.

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:21.823

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.548
and nothing to stop it.

00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:27.124
The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees
from coming into our countries.

00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:30.136
The issue should be
not forcing them to leave their own.
