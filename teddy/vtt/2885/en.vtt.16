00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.948
I showed up late to practice one day
to find the field completely deserted.

00:08:03.972 --> 00:08:05.153
I was really worried.

00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:06.788
My team loved to practice.

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:09.419
It wasn't like them to miss practice.

00:08:09.443 --> 00:08:12.531
I got out of my car, and two kids
ran out from behind a dumpster,

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:14.138
waving their hands frantically.

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:17.142
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:18.744
There was blood everywhere."

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:21.223
"What do you mean?
What do you mean he got beat up?"

00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:23.320
"These bad kids came
and beat him up, Coach.

00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:25.570
Everybody left. They were all scared."

00:08:25.594 --> 00:08:28.312
We hopped into my car
and drove over to Rooh's apartment.

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:30.835
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.
