00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:04.554
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964
during the first Assad regime.

00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:08.025
She was three months pregnant
when she packed up a suitcase,

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.143
piled in her five children
and drove to neighboring Jordan,

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.179
not knowing what the future held
for her and her family.

00:02:14.203 --> 00:02:17.840
My grandfather decided to stay,
not believing it was that bad.

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:22.036
He followed her a month later,
after his brothers were tortured

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.489
and his factory was taken over
by the government.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.233
They rebuilt their lives
starting from scratch

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.532
and eventually became independently
wealthy Jordanian citizens.
