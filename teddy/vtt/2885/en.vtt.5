00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.532
and eventually became independently
wealthy Jordanian citizens.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.462
I was born in Jordan 11 years later.

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.741
It was really important to my grandmother
for us to know our history

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.919
and our journey.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:44.500
I was eight years old when she took me
to visit my first refugee camp.

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:45.964
I didn't understand why.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.767
I didn't know why
it was so important to her

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.241
for us to go.

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:53.204
I remember walking into the camp
holding her hand,

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:55.197
and her saying, "Go play with the kids,"

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.724
while she visited
with the women in the camp.

00:02:58.606 --> 00:02:59.818
I didn't want to.

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.258
These kids weren't like me.
