00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.660
They were a little skeptical
about letting me join it,

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:35.346
because according to them,
girls don't know how to play.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.716
But obviously I did.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.984
I asked them if they had
ever played on a team.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:41.442
They said they hadn't,
but that they would love to.

00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.952
I gradually won them over,
and we formed our first team.

00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:50.735
This group of kids would give me
a crash course in refugees, poverty

00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.229
and humanity.

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.930
Three brothers from Afghanistan --
Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --

00:07:57.954 --> 00:07:59.578
played a major role in that.
