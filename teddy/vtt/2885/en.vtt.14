00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.640
My journey took a strange turn
three years later,

00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.897
after I met a group of refugee kids
playing soccer outside.

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.858
I'd made a wrong turn
into this apartment complex,

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:11.097
and I saw these kids
outside playing soccer.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:14.059
They were playing barefoot
with a raggedy soccer ball

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.535
and rocks set up as goals.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:17.259
I watched them for about an hour,

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:18.861
and after that I was smiling.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:20.883
The boys reminded me of home.

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:23.846
They reminded me of the way
I grew up playing soccer

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.500
in the streets of Jordan,
with my brothers and cousins.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.793
I eventually joined their game.

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.660
They were a little skeptical
about letting me join it,
