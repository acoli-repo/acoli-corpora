00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.363
is that our bubble is just one bubble

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:06.989
in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.815
We're never going to see the stuff outside,

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.389
but by going to the South Pole
and spending three years

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.949
looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.805
we can figure out

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.895
that we're probably in a universe
that looks kind of like that.

00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:21.317
And that amazes me.

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:22.653
Thanks a lot.

00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:25.589
