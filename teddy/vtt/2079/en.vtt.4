00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.266
But if you wait, that ringing fades

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.886
and fades and fades

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.828
until you don't notice it anymore.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:07.476
Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.555
like a metal, way denser,

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:11.960
and if you hit it, it would ring,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.823
but the thing ringing would be

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.911
the structure of space-time itself,

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.727
and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:20.658
What they found on Monday

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.020
was evidence of the ringing

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.335
of the space-time of the early universe,

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.440
what we call gravitational waves

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960
from the fundamental era,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.935
and here's how they found it.
