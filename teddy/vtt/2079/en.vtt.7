00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.318
what that tells us is something
deep about the early universe.

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:32.982
It tells us that we

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:34.418
and everything we see around us

00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:37.372
are basically one large bubble --

00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:39.128
and this is the idea of inflation—

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:43.020
one large bubble surrounded by something else.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.150
This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.324
but anything that isn't inflation that explains this

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:48.641
will look the same.

00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:50.286
This is a theory, an idea,

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:51.510
that has been around for a while,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.235
and we never thought we we'd really see it.

00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:55.073
For good reasons, we thought we'd never see

00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:57.321
killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.331
But the really crazy idea

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.363
is that our bubble is just one bubble
