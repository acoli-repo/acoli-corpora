00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.935
and here's how they found it.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.007
Those waves have long since faded.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:34.495
If you go for a walk,

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:36.083
you don't wiggle.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.831
Those gravitational waves in the structure of space

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.605
are totally invisible for all practical purposes.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:44.509
But early on, when the universe was making

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.879
that last afterglow,

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.437
the gravitational waves

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:51.300
put little twists in the structure

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.827
of the light that we see.

00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:55.793
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:58.431
in fact, these guys spent
three years on the South Pole

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:01.020
looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,
