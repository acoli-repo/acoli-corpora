00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:01.020
looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.370
cleanest air they possibly could find

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.799
looking deep into the night sky and studying

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.175
that glow and looking for the faint twists

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.523
which are the symbol, the signal,

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.343
of gravitational waves,

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.684
the ringing of the early universe.

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:17.471
And on Monday, they announced

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.215
that they had found it.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:21.642
And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me

00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:24.390
is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.748
The thing that's totally amazing,

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.850
the reason I'm on this stage, is because

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.318
what that tells us is something
deep about the early universe.
