00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.472
Now it's been 14 billion years

00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:04.290
since that Big Bang,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.762
and so it's got faint and cold.

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:09.070
It's now 2.7 degrees.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.350
But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.644
It's only 2.7 degrees to about

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.486
10 parts in a million.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:16.480
Over here, it's a little hotter,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.348
and over there, it's a little cooler,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.436
and that's incredibly important
to everyone in this room,

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:23.160
because where it was a little hotter,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.856
there was a little more stuff,

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.423
and where there was a little more stuff,

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.392
we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:29.644
and superclusters

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.352
and all the structure you see in the cosmos.
