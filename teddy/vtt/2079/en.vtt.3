00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.352
and all the structure you see in the cosmos.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:35.464
And those small, little, inhomogeneities,

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.746
20 parts in a million,

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.500
those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.308
in that early universe that were stretched

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:44.587
across the size of the entire cosmos.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.301
That is spectacular,

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:47.966
and that's not what they found on Monday;

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.002
what they found on Monday is cooler.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.268
So here's what they found on Monday:

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:55.771
Imagine you take a bell,

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.382
and you whack the bell with a hammer.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.058
What happens? It rings.

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.266
But if you wait, that ringing fades
