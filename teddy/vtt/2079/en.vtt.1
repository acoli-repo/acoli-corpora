00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.230
when everything we see in the night sky

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.640
was condensed into an incredibly small,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.966
incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.658
and from it sprung everything we see.

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:42.517
Now, we've mapped that afterglow

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:44.196
with great precision,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.240
and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.116
We've mapped the afterglow

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.438
with spectacular precision,

00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:50.986
and one of the shocks about it

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.932
is that it's almost completely uniform.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:55.890
Fourteen billion light years that way

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.750
and 14 billion light years that way,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.158
it's the same temperature.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.472
Now it's been 14 billion years
