00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.576
Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.896
how we define them

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.176
and how they, almost as revenge,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.456
define us.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.536
The English language
is a magnificent sponge.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.216
I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.816
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.280
which is the hunger for disaster.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.296
You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.606
and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm.
