00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.416
they have a word called "zielschmerz"

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.856
which is the dread
of getting what you want.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.976
(Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.960
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.096
I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.736
Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.416
as I go about my day,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.576
but I'm really glad they exist.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.336
But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.976
I am the author of "The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.096
which I've been writing
for the last seven years.
