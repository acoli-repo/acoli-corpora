00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.736
That is the closest thing we have
to a master key.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.336
That's the most commonly
understood word in the world,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.616
no matter where you are.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.856
The problem with that is,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.576
no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.896
(Laughter)

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.976
Which is kind of weird, right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.456
I mean, it could be a misspelling
of "all correct," I guess,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.736
or "old kinderhook."

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.616
No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.136
says something about
how we add meaning to words.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.960
The meaning is not
in the words themselves.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.680
We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it.
