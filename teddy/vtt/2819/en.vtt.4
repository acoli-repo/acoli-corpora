00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.136
the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.816
and everyone else is just extras.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.536
But in reality,
we're all the main character,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.639
and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.256
And so as soon as I published that,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.976
I got a lot of response from people

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.616
saying, "Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.656
but there was no word for that."

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440
So it made them feel less alone.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.960
That's the power of words,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.640
to make us feel less alone.
