00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.096
which I've been writing
for the last seven years.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.136
And the whole mission of the project

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.336
is to find holes
in the language of emotion

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.576
and try to fill them

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.496
so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.936
and quirks of the human condition

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.936
that we all feel
but may not think to talk about

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.656
because we don't have the words to do it.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.096
And about halfway through this project,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.736
I defined "sonder,"

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.136
the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character
