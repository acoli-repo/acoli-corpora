00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.856
and just sort of get on with things.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.440
But once you realize that people --

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.056
that this world was built
by people no smarter than you,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.176
then you can reach out
and touch those walls

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.896
and even put your hand through them

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280
and realize that you have
the power to change it.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.736
And when people ask me,
"Are these words real?"

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.856
I had a variety of answers
that I tried out.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.016
Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.616
But one of them I tried out was,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.176
"Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."
