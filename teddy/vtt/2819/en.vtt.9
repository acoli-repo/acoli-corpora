00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.080
And if it gets us into one brain,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.176
it's not really worth it,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.456
not really worth knowing.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.936
Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.160
A million brains, OK, now we're talking.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.256
And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.536
That's what makes it worth knowing.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.376
Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.616
[O.K.]

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.856
That's it.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.136
The realest word we have.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.736
That is the closest thing we have
to a master key.
