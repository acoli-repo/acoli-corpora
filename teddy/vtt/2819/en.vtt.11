We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.200
And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.896
and searching for the meaning of life,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.160
I think words have
something to do with that.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.816
And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.840
the dictionary is a decent place to start.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.136
It brings a sense of order

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.920
to a very chaotic universe.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.720
Our view of things is so limited

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.336
that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands
