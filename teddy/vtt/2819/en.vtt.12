00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.336
that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.656
and try to figure out
a way to interpret it

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.520
and be able to get on with our day.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.520
We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.440
I think a lot of us feel boxed in

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.896
by how we use these words.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.256
We forget that words are made up.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.640
It's not just my words.
All words are made up,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.960
but not all of them mean something.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.976
We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.736
that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us,
