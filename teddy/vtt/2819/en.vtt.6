00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.280
I started to think
about what makes words real,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.056
because a lot of people ask me,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.416
the most common thing
I got from people is,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.696
"Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.776
And I didn't really know what to tell them

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.736
because once sonder started to take off,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.440
who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.216
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.696
as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.736
we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.856
and just sort of get on with things.
