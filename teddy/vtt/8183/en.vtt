Stephanie Mehta: Welcome, Anjali.

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:03.916
I'm so glad you're here with us today.

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:06.085
Anjali Sud: Thank you,
it is great to be here.

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:10.173
SM: At Vimeo, you lead a workforce
of 1,300 people worldwide --

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:13.760
you have creatives,
you have finance people,

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.678
you have technologists.

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:18.097
So I'm going to start
with a really easy question:

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:21.350
what was it like to manage
this diverse workforce

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.604
through a global pandemic,
a racial reckoning

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.940
and a very fraught return to office?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.650
AS: Oh, it was a breeze, Stephanie.

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:32.320
No, it was really challenging.
