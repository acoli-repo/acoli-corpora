00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.582
When I was 12 years old,

00:00:02.582 --> 00:00:04.917
I fractured my foot playing soccer.

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:08.212
I didn't tell my parents
when I got home that night,

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:12.175
because the next day,
my dad was taking me to see a movie,

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:13.426
a soccer movie.

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:16.721
I worried that if I told
my parents about the foot,

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:19.057
they would take me to see a doctor.

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:20.808
I didn't want to see a doctor,

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:22.560
I wanted to see the movie.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:25.438
The next morning, my dad goes,

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:28.608
"It's nice out. Why don't we walk
to the theater."

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.276
(Laughter)
