As Riadh Guerfali,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
remarked over this incident,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
"Before, things were simple:

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Today, things are a lot more subtle."

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The reality is

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that even in democratic societies today,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we do not have good answers

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
for how you balance the need

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for security and law enforcement on one hand

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and protection of civil liberties

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and free speech on the other
