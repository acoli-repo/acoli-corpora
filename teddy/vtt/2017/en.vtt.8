famously said to CNN

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
after Mubarak stepped down,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
just give them the Internet."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But overthrowing a government is one thing

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and building a stable democracy

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But some of the files were left behind intact,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and activists, some of them,
