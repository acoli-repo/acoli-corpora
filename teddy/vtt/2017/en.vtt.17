00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
where the Internet Society of China presented awards

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to the top 20 Chinese companies

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that are best at exercising self-discipline --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
i.e. policing their content.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
China's dominant search engine,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
was one of the recipients.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and directly censor websites.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But this is a website called Rospil

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that's an anti-corruption site.
