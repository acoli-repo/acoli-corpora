00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Of course, it's going to empower

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
whoever is most skilled at using the technology

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and best understands the Internet

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is to serve citizens,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and I would argue

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that the only legitimate purpose of technology
