that it might be used to organize violent attacks.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So here's the thing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have a situation where private companies

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
are applying censorship standards

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that are often quite arbitrary

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and generally more narrow

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
than the free speech constitutional standards

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that we have in democracies.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Or they're responding to censorship requests

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
by governments that have no jurisdiction

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
over many, or most, of the users and viewers
