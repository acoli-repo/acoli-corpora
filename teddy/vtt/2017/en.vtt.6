00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
engineering, design, terms of service

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all act as a kind of law

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And their sovereignties,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
cross-cutting, globally interlinked,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
can in some ways

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
challenge the sovereignties of nation-states

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in very exciting ways,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but sometimes also act

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to project and extend it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at a time when control

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
over what people can and cannot do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
with information

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
has more effect than ever

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
on the exercise of power

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in our physical world.
