And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
not nearly as extensively

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
as under President Ben Ali.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But you'll see here a blocked page

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of what happens when you try to reach

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
certain Facebook pages and some other websites

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that the transitional authorities

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
have determined might incite violence.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In protest over this,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
blogger Slim Amamou,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who had been jailed under Ben Ali

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and then became part of the transitional government

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
after the revolution,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
