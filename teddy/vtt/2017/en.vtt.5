00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
by governments that have no jurisdiction

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
over many, or most, of the users and viewers

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
who are interacting with the content in question.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So here's the situation.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In a pre-Internet world,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
sovereignty over our physical freedoms,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or lack thereof,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000

But now we have this new layer

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of private sovereignty

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in cyberspace.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And their decisions about software coding,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
engineering, design, terms of service

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
