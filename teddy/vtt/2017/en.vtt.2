00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Fast-forward more than two decades:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Apple launches the iPhone in China

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and censors the Dalai Lama out

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
along with several other politically sensitive applications

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
at the request of the Chinese government

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
for its Chinese app store.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The American political cartoonist

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Mark Fiore

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
also had his satire application

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
censored in the United States

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because some of Apple's staff

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
His app wasn't reinstated

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
