That's a lot of water.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.216
It seems that the industry
that always has been

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.856
and probably always will be
on the forefront of design,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.456

patient zero for sustainable
business practices.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.616
And I think to get started,
all we have to do

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.896
is start to design clothes
to be recyclable at the end of their life.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.576
Now, designing recyclable clothing
