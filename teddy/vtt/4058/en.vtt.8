00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.256
But in order for us to efficiently
recycle a jacket like this,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.496
we need to be able
to easily remove these items

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.496
and quickly get down to just the fabric.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.936
Once we have just the fabric,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.016
we're able to break it down
by shredding it

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.656
and getting back to thread level,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.096
make new thread that then
gets made into new fabric

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.496
and ultimately new clothing,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.255
whether it be a new jacket
or new T-shirts, for example.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.856
But the complexity lies
with all of these extra items,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.736
the buttons, the zippers and the trim.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.136
Because in reality, these items
are actually quite difficult to remove.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.616
So in many cases it requires
more time or more money

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.416
to disassemble a jacket like this.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.536
In some cases, it's just more
cost-effective to throw it away
