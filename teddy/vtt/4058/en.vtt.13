00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.296
end up in water bodies that neighbor
production hubs in developing nations.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.696
The tricky thing is
that these harsh chemicals

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.536
are really effective
at keeping a garment a specific color

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.296
for a long period of time.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.056
It's these harsh chemicals
that keep that bright red dress

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.936
bright red for so many years.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.416
But what if we were able
to use something different?

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.256
What if we were able to use something

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.536
that we all have
in our kitchen cabinets at home

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.776
to dye our clothes?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.816
What if we were able to use
spices and herbs to dye our clothes?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.416
There's countless food options
that would allow for us to stain material,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.360
but these stains change color over time.
