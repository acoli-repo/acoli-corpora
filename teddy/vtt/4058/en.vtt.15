00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.296
that we flick through
on our Instagram feeds

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.736
are chock-full of models and taste-makers

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.936
that are showcasing their individuality

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.976
through their personal microbrands.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.336
But what could be
more personalized, more unique,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.496
than clothes that change color over time?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.696
Clothes that with each wash
and with each wear

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.616
become more and more one of a kind.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.456
People have been buying
and wearing ripped jeans for years.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.056
So this would just be another example
of clothes that exist in our wardrobe

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.216
that evolve with us over our lives.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.016
This shirt, for example, is one that,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.936
much to the dismay of my mother
and the state of her kitchen,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.016
I dyed at home, using turmeric,
before coming here today.
