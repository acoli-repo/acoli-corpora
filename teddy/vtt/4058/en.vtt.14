but these stains change color over time.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.456
This would be pretty different
than the clothes that were dyed harshly

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.136
with chemicals that we're used to.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.816
But dyeing clothes naturally this way
would allow for us

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.896
to make sure they're more unique
and environmentally friendlier.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.136
Let's think about it.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.136
Fashion today is all about individuality.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.416
It's about managing your own
personal appearance

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.496
to be just unique enough to be cool.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.536
These days, everybody has the ability
to showcase their brand

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.816
their personal style,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.816
across the world, through social media.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.176
The pocket-sized billboards

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.296
that we flick through
on our Instagram feeds
