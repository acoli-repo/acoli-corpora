00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.056
is a challenge that most consumer-facing
businesses encounter.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.656
So being able to tackle this

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.300
while also providing
an environmentally friendly product

00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:08.816
could lead to a pretty
seismic industry shift.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.096
And at that point,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.816
it's not just about doing
what's best for our environment

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.896
but also what's best for the bottom line.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.576
There's no fix-all,
and there's no one-step solution.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.176
But we can get started

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.896
by designing clothes
with their death in mind.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.016
The fashion industry
is the perfect industry

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.136
to experiment with and embrace change

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.496
that can one day get us
to the sustainable future

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.736
we so desperately need.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.976
Thank you.
