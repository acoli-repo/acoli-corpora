00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.016
to donate your old ratty socks
that have holes in them

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.376
to your local thrift store.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.616
But what if we were able
to compost these items

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.576
rather than throw them in the trash bin?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.546
The environmental savings could be huge,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.736
and all we would have to do
is start to shift more of our resources

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.896
to start to produce more of these items
using more natural fibers,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.480
like 100 percent organic cotton.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.736
Now, recycling and composting
are two critical priorities.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.816
But one other thing
that we have to rethink

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.536
is the way that we dye our clothes.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.136
Currently, 10 to 20 percent
of the harsh chemical dye that we use

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.296
end up in water bodies that neighbor
production hubs in developing nations.
