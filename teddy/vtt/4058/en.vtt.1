00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.296
so I could tailor the 90's-style
garments that I was finding,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.416
to fit a more contemporary aesthetic.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.736
I've been tailoring and making
my own clothes from scratch ever since,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.976
so everything in my closet
is uniquely my own.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.856
But as I was sorting through the endless
racks of clothes at these thrift stores,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.136
I started to ask myself,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.496
what happens to all the clothes
that I don't buy?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.576
The stuff that isn't really cool or trendy

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.856
but kind of just sits there and rots away
at these secondhand stores.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.376
I work in the fashion industry
on the wholesale side,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.936
and I started to see
some of the products that we sell

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.976
end up on the racks
of these thrift stores.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.176
So the question started to work its way
into my work life, as well.
