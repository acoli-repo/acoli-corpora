00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.576
Now, designing recyclable clothing

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.176
is definitely something
to leave to the professionals.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.656
But as a 24-year-old
thrift store aficionado

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.056
armed with a sewing machine,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.536
if I were to very humbly
posit one perspective,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.176
it would be to approach clothing design
kind of like building with Lego.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.016
When we put together a brick of Lego,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.216
it's very strong
but very easily manipulated.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.016
It's modular in its nature.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.760
Clothing design as it stands today
is very rarely modular.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.496
Take this motorcycle jacket as an example.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.296
It's a pretty standard jacket
with its buttons, zippers and trim.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.256
But in order for us to efficiently
recycle a jacket like this,
