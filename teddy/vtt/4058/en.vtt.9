In some cases, it's just more
cost-effective to throw it away

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.056
rather than recycle it.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.336
But I think this can change
if we design clothes in a modular way

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.096
to be easily disassembled
at the end of their lives.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.256
We could redesign this jacket
to have a hidden wireframe,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.920
kind of like the skeleton of a fish,
that holds all important items together.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.096
This invisible fish-bone structure
can have all of these extra items,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.096
the zippers and the buttons and the trim,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.256
sewn into it and then
attached to the fabric.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.976
So at the end of the jacket's life,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.056
all you have to do
is remove its fish bone

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.496
and the fabric comes with it
