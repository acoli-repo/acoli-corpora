00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.336
One where the technology
doesn't really change

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.696
and the focus is more so
on driving profitability

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.616
at the expense of a sustainable future.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.216
But I was really surprised to see
that the fashion industry was number two.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.936
Because maintaining that status quo

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.616
is the opposite of what
the fashion industry stands for.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.976
The unfortunate reality is,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.616
not only do we waste
a lot of the things we do consume,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.896
but we also use a lot to produce
the clothes that we buy each year.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.736
On average, a household's purchase
of clothing per year

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.936
requires 1,000 bathtubs
of water to produce.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.136
A thousand bathtubs of water
per household, per year.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.816
That's a lot of water.
