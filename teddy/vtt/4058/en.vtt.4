00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.736
Now, even with this,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.816
I still think that Canadians
are the more polite North Americans,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.336
so don't hold it against us.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.096
(Laughter)

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.263
What was even more surprising
was seeing that the fashion industry

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.336
is the second-largest
polluter in the world

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.896
behind the oil and gas industry.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.856
This is an important comparison to make.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.096
I don't want to defend
the oil and gas industry

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.146
but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised
to hear they were the number one polluter.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.656
I just assumed, fairly or not,
that that's an industry

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.136
that doesn't really mind
sticking to the status quo.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.336
One where the technology
doesn't really change
