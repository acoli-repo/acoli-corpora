00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.496
and the fabric comes with it

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.536
a lot quicker and a lot
easier than before.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.496
Now, recycling clothing
is definitely one piece of the puzzle.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.776
But if we want to take

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.736
fixing the environmental impact
that the fashion industry has

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.976
more seriously,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.296
then we need to take this to the next step

at the end of their lives.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.216
For most of the types of clothes
we have in our closet

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.296
the average lifespan is about three years.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.256
Now, I'm sure there's many of us
that have gems in our drawers

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.456
that are much older than that,
which is great.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.016
Because being able to extend the life
of a garment by even only nine months
