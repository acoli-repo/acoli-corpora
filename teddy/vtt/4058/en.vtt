A few years ago, I found myself

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.776
looking for the most
cost-effective way to be stylish.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.536
So naturally, I wound up
at my local thrift store,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.696
a wonderland of other people's trash

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.496
that was ripe to be plucked
to become my treasure.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.576
Now, I wasn't just looking
for your average

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.056
off-the-secondhand-rack
vintage T-shirt to wear.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.176
For me, real style lives
at the intersection of design

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.456
and individuality.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.096
So to make sure that I was getting
the most out of the things I was finding,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.376
I bought a sewing machine

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.296
so I could tailor the 90's-style
garments that I was finding,
