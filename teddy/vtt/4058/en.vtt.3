00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.656
end up in landfills every year.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.656
Now, I want to put this into perspective,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.976
because I don't quite think

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.136
that the 85 percent
does the problem justice.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.536
This means that almost 13 million tons
of clothing and textile waste

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.896
end up in landfills every year
in just the United States alone.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.576
This averages out to be
roughly 200 T-shirts per person

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.256
ending up in the garbage.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.576
In Canada, we throw away enough clothing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.536
to fill the largest stadium
in my home town of Toronto,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.616
one that seats 60,000 people,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.880
with a mountain of clothes
three times the size of that stadium.
