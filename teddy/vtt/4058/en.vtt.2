00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.176
So the question started to work its way
into my work life, as well.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.456
I did some research

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.016
and I pretty quickly found
a very scary supply chain

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.496
that led me to some
pretty troubling realities.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.901
It turned out that the clothes
I was sorting though

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.136
at these thrift stores

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.216
represented only a small fraction
of the total amount of garments

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.621
that we dispose of each year.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:20.536
In the US, only 15 percent
of the total textile and garment waste

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.496
that's generated each year

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.016
ends up being donated
or recycled in some way,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.296
which means that the other 85 percent
of textile and garment waste

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.656
end up in landfills every year.
