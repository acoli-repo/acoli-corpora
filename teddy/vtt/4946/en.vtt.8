00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:03.037
Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history.

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:06.023
Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one?

00:04:06.023 --> 00:04:09.253
The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe,

00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:11.543
the amount of dark energy it holds,

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.133
and changes in its expansion rate.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:18.953
As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze.

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:24.443
But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:26.233
before the chill sets in —

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.233
so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.
