00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:30.771
The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore,

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.191
but the universe would keep 
getting bigger.

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.091
Clusters of galaxies would separate.

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.341
The objects within the galaxies–

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.041
suns, planets, and solar systems

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.671
would move away from each other,

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:45.581
until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.551
floating separately in the vast space.

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.961
The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.581
with very low, faint energies,

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.281
and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars.

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.270
The universe would become 
darker and colder,
