00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:09.738
We know about our universe’s past:

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:14.258
the Big Bang theory predicts that all 
matter, time, and space

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:20.598
began in an incredibly tiny, compact 
state about 14 billion years ago.

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.433
And we know about the present:

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.993
scientists’ observations of the movement 
of galaxies

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:30.083
tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate.
