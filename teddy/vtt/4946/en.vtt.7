00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.346
a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.276
This is the Big Crunch.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:39.576
Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang?

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:43.419
Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.729
repeating its entire history?

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.119
The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce.

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.829
In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened—

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.447
or how many might happen in the future.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:03.037
Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history.
