00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.270
The universe would become 
darker and colder,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.650
approaching a frozen state

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.500
also known as the Big Chill,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.380
or the Heat Death of the Universe.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.340
But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.080
that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.870
and actually tears it?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.990
If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.760
it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force –

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
tearing apart galaxies and solar systems–

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.960
but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces
