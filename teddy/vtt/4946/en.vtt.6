00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.005
Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other,

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:02.495
and as they clumped together

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:06.015
their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:09.205
Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:13.205
Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.485
The size of the universe would plummet

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:19.165
until everything compressed into such 
a small space

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:24.165
that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:29.666
The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe —

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.346
a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang.
