00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.495
that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:06.215
Copy this system over and over again,

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:09.525
and you have something 
approximating the real universe.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.095
The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.725
determines how the end of the 
universe will play out.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:22.035
The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:27.565
is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity.

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:30.771
The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore,
