00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.960
but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.716
which hold atoms and nuclei together.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.566
As a result,

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.806
the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces.

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:42.227
Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.967
That’s the Big Rip.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.607
What about the third scenario,

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.877
where the rubber band wins out?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.577
That corresponds to a possible future

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:55.917
in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt—

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.195
and then reverses it.

00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.005
Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other,
