00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:30.083
tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate.

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.695
But what about the future?

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.095
Do we know how our universe 
is going to end?

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.685
Cosmologists have three 
possible answers for this question,

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.415
called the Big Freeze,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.855
the Big Rip and the Big Crunch.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:46.215
To understand these three scenarios,

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:49.885
imagine two objects representing galaxies.

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:53.425
A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together—

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.235
that’s the attractive force of gravity.

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.725
Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart—

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.495
that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe.
