00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:04.110
So, embryonic stem cells

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.410
are really incredible cells.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.198
They are our body's own repair kits,

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:13.162
and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.594
all of the cells in our bodies.

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:18.282
Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.267
to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.698
But that's not what I want to talk to you about,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:26.376
because right now there are some really

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:30.322
extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
