Some years ago, I set out to try to understand

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.887
if there was a possibility to develop biofuels

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:10.589
on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.273
but not compete with agriculture for water,

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:16.711
fertilizer or land.

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.241
So here's what I came up with.

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.849
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.127
just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:25.255
and some form of microalgae that produces oil,

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:27.415
and we make it out of some kind of flexible material

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:29.487
that moves with waves underwater,

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.527
and the system that we're going to build, of course,
