00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.136
Now, once we published the results,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.736
we were surprised
about the reactions in the media.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.656
We got quite some attention.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.176
And it went from quite factual,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.456
like "Higher Female Share
Boosts Innovation"

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.976
to a little bit more sensationalist.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.936
(Laughter)

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.176
As you can see,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.296
"Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions,"

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.256
and, my personal favorite,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.656
"Housewives Kill Innovation."

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.696
Well, there's no such thing
as bad publicity, right?
