Our data shows that for gender diversity
to have an impact on innovation,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.920
you need to have more
than 20 percent women in leadership.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.080
Let's have a look at the numbers.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.296
As you can see, we divided
the sample into three groups,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.216
and the results are quite dramatic.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.936
Only in the group where you have
more than 20 percent women in leadership,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.840
only then you see a clear jump
in innovation revenue

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.816
to above-average levels.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.496
So experience and data
shows that you do need critical mass
