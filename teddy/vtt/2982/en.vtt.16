00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.720
Now, let's have a look
at what happened in reality.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.040
It's not even close,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.576
which means I was so wrong

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.376
and which means that my generation,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.600
your generation,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.200
the best-educated
female generation in history,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.936
we have just not made it.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.456
We have failed to achieve leadership
in significant numbers.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.400
Education just did not
translate into leadership.
