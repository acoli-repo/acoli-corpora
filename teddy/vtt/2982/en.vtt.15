00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.056
taking Germany as an example.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.296
Let me first give you the good news.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.136
So the share of women
who are college graduates

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.576
and have at least 10 years
of professional experience

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.896
has grown nicely over the last 20 years,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.696
which means the pool
in which to fish for female leaders

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.856
has increased over time,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.576
and that's great.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.440
Now, according to my old theory,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.456
the share of women in leadership

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.800
would have grown
more or less in parallel, right?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.720
Now, let's have a look
at what happened in reality.
