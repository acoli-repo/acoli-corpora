00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.760
Which way is it?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.040
Now, we do not know how much
is correlation versus causation,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.856
but what we do know is that clearly,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.056
in our sample, companies
that are more diverse

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.576
are more innovative,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.896
and that companies
that are more innovative

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.760
have more diverse leadership, too.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.016
So it's fair to assume
that it works both ways,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.920
diversity driving innovation
and innovation driving diversity.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.136
Now, once we published the results,
