00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.840
and the results convinced
the most skeptical amongst us.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.416
The answer was a clear yes,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.200
no ifs, no buts.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.976
The data in our sample showed

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.480
that more diverse companies
are simply more innovative, period.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.136
Now, a fair question to ask
is the chicken or the egg question,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.576
meaning, are companies
really more innovative

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.256
because they have
a more diverse leadership,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.536
or the other way around?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.760
Which way is it?
