Well, there's no such thing
as bad publicity, right?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.056
(Laughter)

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.056
On the back of that coverage,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.536
we started to get calls
from senior executives

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.256
wanting to understand more,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.840
especially -- surprise, surprise --
about gender diversity.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.776
I tend to open up
those discussions by asking,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.936
"Well, what do you think of the situation
in your organization today?"

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.520
And a frequent reaction to that is,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.520
"Well, we're not yet there,
but we're not that bad."
