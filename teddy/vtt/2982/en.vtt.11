"Well, we're not yet there,
but we're not that bad."

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.416
One executive told me, for example,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.976
"Oh, we're not that bad.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.736
We have one member
in our board who is a woman."

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.096
(Laughter)

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.336
And you laugh --

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.320
(Applause)

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.136
Now, you laugh, but he had a point
in being proud about it,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.496
because in Germany,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.496
if you have a company

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.096
and it has one member
on the board who is a woman,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.536
you are part of a select group of 30

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.216
out of the 100 largest
publicly listed companies.
