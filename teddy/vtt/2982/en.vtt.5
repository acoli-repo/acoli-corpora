00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.296
To measure diversity,
we looked at six different factors:

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.880
country of origin,
age and gender, amongst others.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.256
While preparing to go in the field
with those questions,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.536
I sat down with my team

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.840
and we discussed what
we would expect as a result.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.760
To put it mildly, we were not optimistic.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.536
The most skeptical person on the team
thought, or saw a real possibility,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.960
that we would find nothing at all.
