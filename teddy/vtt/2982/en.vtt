Fifteen years ago,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.760
I thought that the diversity stuff
was not something I had to worry about.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.720
It was something an older
generation had to fight for.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.656
In my university,
we were 50-50, male-female,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.456
and we women often had better grades.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.856
So while not everything was perfect,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.896
diversity and leadership decisions

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.000
was something that would happen
naturally over time, right?
