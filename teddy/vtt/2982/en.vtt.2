00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.736
hitting the numbers,
delivering the new product,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.040
the real goals they are measured by.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.856
My personal experience
working with diverse teams

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.976
had been that while they require
a little bit more effort at the beginning,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.200
they did bring fresher,
more creative ideas.

So I wanted to know:

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.856
Are diverse organizations
really more innovative,
