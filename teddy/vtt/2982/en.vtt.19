00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.536
The goals made them think more creatively
about developing leaders

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.016
and tapping new recruiting pools.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.400
They now even set a target of 30 percent
women in leadership for 2022.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.936
So experience shows it's doable,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.936
and at the end of the day,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.096
it all boils down to two decisions
that are taken every day

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.880
in every organization by many of us:

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.040
who to hire and who
to develop and promote.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.576
Now, nothing against women's programs,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.936
networks, mentoring, trainings.
