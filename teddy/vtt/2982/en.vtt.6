00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.656
Most of the team
was rather on the cautious side,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.576
so we landed all together at "only if,"

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.696
meaning that we might find
some kind of link

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.256
between innovation and diversity,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.936
but not across the board --

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.856
rather only if certain criteria are met,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.936
for example leadership style,
very open leadership style

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.120
that allowed people to speak up freely
and safely and contribute.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280
A couple of months later,
the data came in,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.840
and the results convinced
the most skeptical amongst us.
