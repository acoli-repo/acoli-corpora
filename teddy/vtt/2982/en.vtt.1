Well, not quite.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.056
While moving up the ladder
working as a management consultant

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.136
across Europe and the US,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.736
I started to realize how often
I was the only woman in the room

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.280
and how homogenous leadership still is.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.336
Many leaders I met

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.176
saw diversity as something to comply with
out of political correctness,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840
or, best case, the right thing to do,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.680
but not as a business priority.
