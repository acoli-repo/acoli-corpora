00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:03.198
I'm sitting in a bar
with a couple of friends --

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:04.962
literally, a couple, married couple.

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:07.410
They're the parents of two young children,

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:09.422
seven academic degrees between them,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.639
big nerds, really nice people
but very sleep-deprived.

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:19.182
And they ask me the question
I get asked more than any other question.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.827
They go, "So, Emily,

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:27.348
how do couples, you know,
sustain a strong sexual connection

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:29.093
over multiple decades?"
