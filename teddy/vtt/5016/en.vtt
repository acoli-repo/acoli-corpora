In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.731
Thereâ€™s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people,

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:24.131
but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium.

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:28.352
The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis;

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:34.451
the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis.
