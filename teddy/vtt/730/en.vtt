Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
has, in the last few years

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
has released more classified documents

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
than the rest of the world's media combined.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Can that possibly be true?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is doing such a bad job

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that a little group of activists

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is able to release more

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of that type of information

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
than the rest of the world press combined.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
CA: How does it work?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How do people release the documents?
