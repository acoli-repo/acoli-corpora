Mountain biking in Israel

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is something that I do with great passion

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and commitment.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And when I'm on my bike,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I feel that I connect

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with the profound beauty of Israel,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I feel that I'm united

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with this country's history

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and biblical law.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And also, for me,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
biking is a matter of empowerment.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When I reach the summit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
