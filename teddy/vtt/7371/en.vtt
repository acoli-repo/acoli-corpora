00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:03.756
So I'm going to talk to you
about carbon removals,

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:05.756
and I’m going to start with this.

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.356
This is a woolly pig.

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:10.596
(Laughter)

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:12.876
She's gorgeous, obviously,

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.836
and she’s also one part
in a whole new set of approaches

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.396
for dealing with climate change.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:21.836
They are all called carbon removals,

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:25.156
and they all involve
taking CO2 out of the sky

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:26.956
and storing it somewhere safe.

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.836
I’ll come back to the woolly pig later,

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:33.436
but first, why do we need carbon removals?
