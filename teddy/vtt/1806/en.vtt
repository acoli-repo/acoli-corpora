It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.344
and I suddenly realized

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.798
that the next day was Mother's Day,

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:11.644
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.045
so I started thinking about

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.382
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.226
I thought, why don't I make her

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:20.275
an interactive Mother's Day card

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.983
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:26.800
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.180
We developed it so that people could easily create
