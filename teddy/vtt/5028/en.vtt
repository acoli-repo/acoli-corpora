I'd like you to take a moment

00:00:01.736 --> 00:00:04.736
and consider what
you are wearing right now.

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.547

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.761
Why are we not all wearing
comfortable pajamas right now?

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:12.785
(Laughter)

Well, I'm a psychologist
and not a mind reader,

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:17.743
although many people think
that's the same thing.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:21.736
I can bet you that your response
is somewhere along the lines of,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.434
"I'm expected to not wear pj's in public"

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.006
or "I don't want people
to think I am a slob."

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:31.716
Either way, the fact that we all
chose to wear business casual clothing,
