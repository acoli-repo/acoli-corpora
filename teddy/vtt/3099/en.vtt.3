Social media was supposed
to place us in a veritable town square,

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:38.324
where we could engage one another
with challenging ideas and debates.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.238
And instead what we got were trolls.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:44.839
This is an actual tweet that I received.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.374
"Chuck, no one wants to hear
your stupid, ill-informed political views!

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:52.719
I hope you get leprosy and die.

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:54.151
Love, Dad"

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:55.842
(Laughter)

00:01:56.796 --> 00:01:59.449
Now, the great thing
about that tweet if you look at it,

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:01.460
just like most trolls, it's not that bad,
