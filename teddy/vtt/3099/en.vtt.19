I mean, it's a little awkward at times,

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:33.036
but you should see my credit rating.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.783
Impressive, very impressive."

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.246
(Laughter)

00:09:37.353 --> 00:09:39.693
Now, all of this seems scary,

00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:42.364
and everybody in this room
knows that it isn't.

00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:43.850
Technology isn't scary.

00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:47.483
Never has been and it never will be.

00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:50.784
What's scary is us

00:09:50.808 --> 00:09:52.800
and what we will do with technology.

00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:56.421
Will we allow it to expose our humanity,

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:59.641
showing our true selves

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:03.509
and reinforcing the fact
that we are indeed our brother's keeper?
