00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.952
Social media was supposed
to bring us together

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:35.419
in ways we could never imagine.

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.212
And the predictors were correct.

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.254
These three girls
are talking to one another

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:44.312
without the awkward discomfort
of eye contact.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.665
(Laughter)

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.769
I call that advancement.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.041
We were supposed to be caught up
in a communication tsunami,

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:55.905
the likes of which the world
has never seen.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.674
And that did happen.

00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.479
And so did this.
