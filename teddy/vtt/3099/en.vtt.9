00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.058
Nobody will own their car in the future,

00:04:39.082 --> 00:04:42.128
and that means teenagers
will not have a place to make out.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:44.919
So you know what that means.

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:48.173
That means they will order
driverless cars to do just that.

00:04:48.602 --> 00:04:52.967
I do not want to step into a vehicle
and ask the question:

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:57.784
"Why does this car smell like
awkwardness, failure and shame?"

00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:59.966
(Laughter)
