00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:04.197
(Sings) One of these things
is not like the other.

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:05.918
(Speaks) Now, look at this picture.

00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:08.406
If you picked the guy
with the book, you’re wrong --

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.194
or, as a certain president
would say, "Wrong!"

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.140
(Laughter)

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:17.783
Clearly, three of these guys are reading,

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:20.187
and one guy, on the end,
is listening to music

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.710
and playing "Candy Crush."

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.285
(Laughter)

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:25.445
So are we more connected,

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.114
or are we just more connected
to our devices?
