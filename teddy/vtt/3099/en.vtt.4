just like most trolls, it's not that bad,

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:05.154
because he wished "leporsy" on me
instead of "leprosy,"

00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:08.019
and "leporsy" is not dangerous at all.

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:09.624
(Laughter)

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:11.308
(Applause)

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:18.850
Along with trolls, we got
a brand new way of torturing teenagers --

00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:20.239
cyberbullying.

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:25.781
A concept that my 75-year-old mother
just can't seem to wrap her head around.

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:28.543
"So, uh, did they hit him?"

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.249
"No, Mom, they didn't hit him."
