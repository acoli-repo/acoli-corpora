00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.960
If I want to ask that question,
I'll walk into my own bedroom.

00:05:03.984 --> 00:05:05.365
(Laughter)

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.399
So what else do we have
to look forward to?

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.247
That's right, artificial intelligence.

00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.562
Artificial intelligence, yes.

00:05:11.586 --> 00:05:14.775
You know, there was a time
when artificial intelligence was a joke.

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:18.431
I mean, literally a quip
that you would hear at a cocktail party

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:20.816
when somebody would
bring it up in conversation:

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.772
"Artificial intelligence.

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:26.352
The only real artificial intelligence
is our American Congress.

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.404
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.845
Well, it's not funny anymore.

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:31.908
(Laughter)
