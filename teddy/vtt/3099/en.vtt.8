00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:01.651
"There's no way this guy
is going to stand up here

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.100
and make a case for the DMV."

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:06.297
Well, I don't know about you,
but I do not want to live in a world

00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:08.599
where harsh fluorescent lights,

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.521
endless lines,

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:12.381
terrible forms to fill out

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:16.380
and disaffected, soulless
bureaucrats remind me

00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:19.846
that I am pretty damn lucky
not to work here.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.020
(Laughter)

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.740
That is the real service they provide.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:25.975
The DMV:

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.060
come for the registration renewal,

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:32.335
stay for the satisfaction of knowing
you made some pretty good life choices.
