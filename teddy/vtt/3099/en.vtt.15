Can't talk about this without
talking about robotics. OK?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.121
Remember when you thought
robotics were cool?

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:35.267
I remember when I thought
robotics were cool,

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.451
until I figured out that they were
going to take everybody's place,

00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:40.741
from the delivery guy
down to the heart surgeon.

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.794
The one thing, though,
that is very disappointing about robotics

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:45.250
is the holy grail of robotics,

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:46.621
and it hasn't even happened.

00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:48.584
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend,

00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:52.216
the dream of one lonely geek
in a windowless basement

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.665
who vowed one day:
"I am going to marry my creation."

00:07:56.738 --> 00:08:01.765
And there actually is a movement underway
to stop this from happening,
