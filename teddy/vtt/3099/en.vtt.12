00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:02.025
how to understand our behavior,

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:05.650
how to defend themselves
and even practice deception.

00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:08.633
What could possibly go wrong?

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:10.248
(Laughter)

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:13.396
The one thing that's for sure:

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.569
the creation always despises its creator.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.236
OK?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.385
The Titans rose up against the gods;

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.141
Lucifer against Jehovah.

00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:25.329
And anybody who has a teenager
has heard these words:

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:27.386
"I hate you and you're ruining my life!

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.560
I hate you!"
