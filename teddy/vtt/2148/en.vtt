00:00:01.228 --> 00:00:05.518
So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:07.590
former arts advocate,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.383
trained in architecture and art history,

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:14.517
and I want to talk to you today not about design

00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:16.953
but about America

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.158
and how America can be more economically resilient,

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.483
how America can be healthier,

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.136
and how America can be

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.754
more environmentally sustainable.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:30.172
And I realize this is a global forum,
