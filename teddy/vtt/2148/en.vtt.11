00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.878
they had a 50-percent increase

00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:32.742
in college-educated millennials,

00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:34.926
which is five times what you saw anywhere else

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:38.202
in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.

00:05:38.202 --> 00:05:42.515
So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:45.095
by being more walkable and more bikeable,

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.930

that people want to be in these days.

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:52.141
So the best economic strategy

is not the old way of trying to attract corporations

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.590
and trying to have a biotech cluster

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.684
or a medical cluster,
