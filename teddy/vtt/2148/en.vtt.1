00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:30.172
And I realize this is a global forum,

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:32.241
but I think I need to talk about America

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.824
because there is a history,

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:35.511
in some places, not all,

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.961
of American ideas being appropriated,

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.790
of the landscape and the creation of the landscape

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.126
around the requirement of automobile use,

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.769
and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom
