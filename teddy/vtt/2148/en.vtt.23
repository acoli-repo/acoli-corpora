If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,

00:11:31.064 --> 00:11:32.579
any carbon map of the U.S.,

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:35.722
it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,

00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:38.178
hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,

00:11:38.178 --> 00:11:41.746
dark, peaceful in the countryside.

00:11:41.746 --> 00:11:43.685
Until some economists said, you know,

00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:46.131
is that the right way to measure CO2?

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:48.117
There are only so many people in this country at any given time,

00:11:48.117 --> 00:11:50.204
and we can choose to live where perhaps

00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:51.843
we would have a lighter impact.

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:54.636
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:57.240
and when they did that, the maps just flipped,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.259
coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,
