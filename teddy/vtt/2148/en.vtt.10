than the rest of America.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.489
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:03.829
than most other states,

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:05.394
which may be a good thing or a bad thing,

00:05:05.394 --> 00:05:07.393
but it makes you glad they're driving less.

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.766

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.102

But there's a whole other Portland story,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.739
which isn't part of this calculus,

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:23.626
which is that young, educated people

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:26.078
have been moving to Portland in droves,

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:28.596
so that between the last two censuses,

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.878
they had a 50-percent increase
