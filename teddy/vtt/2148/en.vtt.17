00:08:28.596 --> 00:08:30.953
Walk Score rates every address in America

00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:32.592
and soon the world

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.981
in terms of how walkable it is --

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.864
they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods

00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:39.557
and less walkable neighborhoods.

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:42.359
Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:44.630
you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.953
If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,

00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:49.160
you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.998
So we have study after study now

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.053
that's tying where you live

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.440
to your health, particularly as in America,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.570
the biggest health crisis we have is this one

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.294
that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.
