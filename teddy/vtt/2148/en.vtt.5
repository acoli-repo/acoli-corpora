00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.902
that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.124
and when the price of gas went up;

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:37.392
they were decimated.

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:38.658
And in fact, these are many

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.261
of the half-vacant communities that you see today.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.442
Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.515
it goes underwater, and you have to pay

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:50.380
twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.100
So we know what it's done to our society

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.431
and all the extra work we have to do

00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:57.200
to support our cars.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.932
What happens when a city decides

00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:01.206
it's going to set other priorities?
