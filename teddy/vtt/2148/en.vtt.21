00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:30.889
Because if your city is designed around cars,

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:35.748
it's really good at smashing them into each other.

00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:39.483
That's part of a much larger health argument.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:41.752
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,

00:10:41.752 --> 00:10:43.993
because the environmentalists turned on a dime

00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:45.512
about 10 years ago.

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.988
The environmental movement in America

00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:50.016
has historically been an anti-city movement

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.527
from Jefferson on.

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.882
"Cities are pestilential to the health,

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:55.873
to the liberties, to the morals of man.

00:10:55.873 --> 00:10:57.983
If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,

00:10:57.983 --> 00:10:59.899
as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.314
as they are in Europe
