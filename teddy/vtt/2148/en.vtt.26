00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.879
this focus on gadgets,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.570
on accessorizing --

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.589
What can I add to my house,

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.701
what can I add to what I've already got

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.164
to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --

00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:14.105
has kind of dominated the discussion.

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:15.959
So I'm not immune to this.

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.494
My wife and I built a new house

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:20.493
on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,

00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:22.595
and we did our best to clear the shelves

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.650
of the sustainability store.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.885
We've got the solar photovoltaic system,

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:29.334
solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:31.242
bamboo floors.
