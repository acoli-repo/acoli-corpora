00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.322
But I can't give design arguments for that

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.011
that will have as much impact

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.927
as the arguments that I've learned

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:39.444
from the economists, the epidemiologists

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:41.160
and the environmentalists.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.421
So these are the three arguments that I'm going

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.532
to give you quickly today.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:47.016
When I was growing up in the '70s,

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.651
the typical American spent one tenth of their income,

00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.890
American family, on transportation.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.475
Since then, we've doubled the number of roads

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:59.252
in America, and we now spend one fifth

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.913
of our income on transportation.
