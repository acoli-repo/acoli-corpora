Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,

00:08:01.988 --> 00:08:03.692
they were shocked to learn that the only difference

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.574
between the subjects that they could figure out

00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:07.458
was the amount they were moving,

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:09.098
and that in fact those who gained weight

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:12.850
were sitting, on average, two hours more per day

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.166
than those who didn't.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.109
So we have these studies that tie

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:18.423
weight to inactivity, but even more,

00:08:18.423 --> 00:08:20.938
we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:22.571
Do you live in a more walkable city

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.007
or do you live in a less walkable city,

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:25.931
or where in your city do you live?

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:28.596
