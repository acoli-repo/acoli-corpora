00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.769
and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.520
has become a gas-belching,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.120
time-wasting and life-threatening

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.553
prosthetic device

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:11.189
that many of us need just to,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.777
most Americans, in fact, need,

00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:15.097
just to live their daily lives.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.681
And there's an alternative.

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.269
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.210
Well, in America, that living in cities,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.868
for many of them, they're living in cities still

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:24.134
where they're dependent on that automobile.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.113
And what I work for, and to do,

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:29.799
is to make our cities more walkable.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.322
But I can't give design arguments for that
