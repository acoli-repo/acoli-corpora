00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.197
the way that Portlanders live,

00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:02.358
and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:03.917
the amount that each person drives,

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:06.230
actually peaked in 1996,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.331
has been dropping ever since,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.395
and they now drive 20 percent less

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:11.828
than the rest of the country.

00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:14.584
The typical Portland citizen drives

00:04:14.584 --> 00:04:18.552
four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:20.874
than they did before.

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:22.861
The economist Joe Cortright did the math

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.379
and he found out that those four miles

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.811
plus those 11 minutes

00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:27.733
adds up to fully three and a half percent

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.263
of all income earned in the region.
