00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.742
from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,

00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:32.999
and the amount that people are driving in your city,

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:35.447
your urban VMT, is a good prediction

00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:37.949
of the asthma problems in your city.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.164
And then finally, in terms of driving,

00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:43.070
there's the issue of the single-largest killer

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.712
of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:47.806
of all people, is car crashes.

00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:49.308
And we take car crashes for granted.

00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:51.143
We figure it's a natural risk

00:09:51.143 --> 00:09:52.725
of being on the road.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.898
But in fact, here in America, 12 people

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:57.254
out of every 100,000

00:09:57.254 --> 00:09:59.352
die every year from car crashes.

00:09:59.352 --> 00:10:00.821
We're pretty safe here.
