00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.859
And we finally have the studies,

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:33.545
one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:36.246
that tracked weight against diet

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:38.151
and tracked weight against inactivity,

00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.854
and found a much higher, stronger correlation

00:07:40.854 --> 00:07:42.902
between the latter two.

00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:44.919
Dr. James Levine at, in this case,

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:47.112
the aptly-named Mayo Clinic

00:07:47.112 --> 00:07:51.651
put his test subjects in electronic underwear,

00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.644
held their diet steady,

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:55.648
and then started pumping the calories in.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.145
Some people gained weight,

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:58.522
some people didn't gain weight.

00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:01.988
Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,
