I believe that this American healthcare crisis

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.468
that we've all heard about

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:05.084
is an urban design crisis,

00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:07.896
and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:10.461
Because we've talked a long time about diet,

00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.215
and we know that diet impacts weight,

00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:15.527
and weight of course impacts health.

00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:18.298
But we've only started talking about inactivity,

00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:21.490
and how inactivity born of our landscape,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.820
inactivity that comes from the fact that we live

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.689
in a place where there is no longer any such thing

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.285
as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.859
And we finally have the studies,
