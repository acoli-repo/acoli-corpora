that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.

00:09:02.294 --> 00:09:04.017
And I learned a new word last week.

00:09:04.017 --> 00:09:07.647
They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.878
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.645
Now that's one thing, of course.

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:15.120
Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic

Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.531
three times what it was in the '90s,

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:26.422
and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.

00:09:26.422 --> 00:09:28.434
American pollution does not come

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.742
from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,
