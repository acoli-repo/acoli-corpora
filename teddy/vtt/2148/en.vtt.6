00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:01.206
it's going to set other priorities?

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.178
And probably the best example we have here

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.589
in America is Portland, Oregon.

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.928
Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:10.626
that began to distinguish it

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:13.162
from almost every other American city.

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:15.280
While most other cities were growing

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.415
an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.090
they instituted an urban growth boundary.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.260
While most cities were reaming out their roads,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.505
removing parallel parking and trees

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.706
in order to flow more traffic,

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:31.439
they instituted a skinny streets program.
