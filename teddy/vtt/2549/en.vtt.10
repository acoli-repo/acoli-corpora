the idea that we each have one great thing

00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:04.536
we are meant to do
during our time on this earth,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.443
and you need to figure out
what that thing is

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.952
and devote your life to it.

00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:14.246
But what if you're someone
who isn't wired this way?

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.404
What if there are a lot of different
subjects that you're curious about,

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:20.453
and many different things you want to do?

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:25.123
Well, there is no room for someone
like you in this framework.

00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:27.785
And so you might feel alone.

00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.625
You might feel like you don't
have a purpose.
