See, while this question inspires kids
to dream about what they could be,

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:05.930
it does not inspire them to dream
about all that they could be.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.352
In fact, it does just the opposite,

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:11.392
because when someone asks you
what you want to be,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.212
you can't reply with 20 different things,

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.131
though well-meaning adults
will likely chuckle and be like,

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:21.207
"Oh, how cute, but you can't be
a violin maker and a psychologist.

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.034
You have to choose."

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:25.874
This is Dr. Bob Childs --

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.975
(Laughter)

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.899
and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.
