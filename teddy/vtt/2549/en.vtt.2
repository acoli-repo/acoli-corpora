00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:03.660
and at a certain point, I began
to notice this pattern in myself

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:06.237
where I would become interested in an area

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.420
and I would dive in, become all-consumed,

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.975
and I'd get to be pretty good
at whatever it was,

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.601
and then I would hit this point
where I'd start to get bored.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.822
And usually I would try
and persist anyway,

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.743
because I had already devoted
so much time and energy

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.263
and sometimes money into this field.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:28.590
But eventually this sense of boredom,

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:33.394
this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,
this isn't challenging anymore --
