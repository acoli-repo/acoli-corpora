00:02:54.796 --> 00:03:00.222
Ask yourself where you learned to assign
the meaning of wrong or abnormal

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.067
to doing many things.

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:05.480
I'll tell you where you learned it:

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:07.590
you learned it from the culture.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:13.865
We are first asked the question
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.457
when we're about five years old.

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.174
And the truth is that no one really cares
what you say when you're that age.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.199
(Laughter)

00:03:20.223 --> 00:03:22.598
It's considered an innocuous question,

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:24.982
posed to little kids
to elicit cute replies,

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.679
like, "I want to be an astronaut,"
or "I want to be a ballerina,"

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:30.586
or "I want to be a pirate."
