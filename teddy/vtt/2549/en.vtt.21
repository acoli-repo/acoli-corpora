00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.474
Now, let's say that you are,
in your heart, a specialist.

00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:38.919
You came out of the womb knowing
you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:42.694
Don't worry -- there's nothing
wrong with you, either.

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:43.758
(Laughter)

00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:46.825
In fact, some of the best teams
are comprised of a specialist

00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:49.456
and multipotentialite paired together.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.514
The specialist can dive in deep
and implement ideas,

00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:56.140
while the multipotentialite brings
a breadth of knowledge to the project.

00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:58.066
It's a beautiful partnership.

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.535
But we should all be designing
lives and careers
