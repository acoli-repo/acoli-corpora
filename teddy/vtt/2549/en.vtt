Raise your hand if you've ever
been asked the question

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:06.382
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:08.322
Now if you had to guess,

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:11.763
how old would you say you were
when you were first asked this question?

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:13.386
You can just hold up fingers.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.632
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:23.332
Now, raise your hand if the question

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.378
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.932
has ever caused you any anxiety.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.586
(Laughter)

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.832
Any anxiety at all.
