As a child concert pianist,
she honed an incredible ability

00:08:30.952 --> 00:08:32.657
to develop muscle memory.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.810
Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.298
(Laughter)

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:40.559
Before becoming a writer,
Nora was a financial planner.

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:42.789
She had to learn
the finer mechanics of sales

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:44.559
when she was starting her practice,

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:48.552
and this skill now helps her
write compelling pitches to editors.

00:08:49.727 --> 00:08:53.597
It is rarely a waste of time
to pursue something you're drawn to,

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.311
even if you end up quitting.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.639
You might apply that knowledge
in a different field entirely,

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.270
in a way that you couldn't
have anticipated.
