00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:01.140
We observe everything
we can get our hands on.

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:02.907
We're also used to being beginners,

00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.053
because we've been beginners
so many times in the past,

00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:09.356
and this means that we're less afraid
of trying new things

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.762
and stepping out of our comfort zones.

00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:15.815
What's more, many skills
are transferable across disciplines,

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.694
and we bring everything we've learned
to every new area we pursue,

00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:22.011
so we're rarely starting from scratch.
