00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.948
I worried that there
was something wrong with this,

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:35.090
and something wrong with me
for being unable to stick with anything.

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:38.064
I worried that I was afraid of commitment,

00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:41.549
or that I was scattered,
or that I was self-sabotaging,

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.239
afraid of my own success.

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.975
If you can relate to my story
and to these feelings,

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.273
I'd like you to ask yourself a question

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.883
that I wish I had asked myself back then.

00:02:54.796 --> 00:03:00.222
Ask yourself where you learned to assign
the meaning of wrong or abnormal
