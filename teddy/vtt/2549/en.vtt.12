It might help if you break it up
into three parts:

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:04.688
multi, potential, and ite.

00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:07.932
You can also use one of the other terms
that connote the same idea,

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:10.922
such as polymath, the Renaissance person.

00:06:10.946 --> 00:06:12.890
Actually, during the Renaissance period,

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:16.573
it was considered the ideal
to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:19.633
Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:23.437
Use whichever term you like,
or invent your own.

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:26.516
I have to say I find it sort of fitting
that as a community,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.002
we cannot agree on a single identity.

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:31.026
