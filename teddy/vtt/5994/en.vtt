00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.954
In a pitch-black cave,
bats can’t see much.

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:11.704
But even with their eyes shut,

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:15.829
they can navigate rocky topography 
at incredible speeds.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.329
This is because a bat’s flight
isn’t just guided by its eyes,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.413
but rather, by its ears.

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.538
It may seem impossible to see
with sound,

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:28.954
but bats, naval officers, and doctors
do it all the time,

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.954
using the unique properties of ultrasound.
