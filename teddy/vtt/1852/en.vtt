00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:02.500
I'd like to talk about my dad.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.076
My dad has Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:08.636
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.023
and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.

00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:16.348
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.236
he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:24.100
or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.612
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:31.140
and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.
