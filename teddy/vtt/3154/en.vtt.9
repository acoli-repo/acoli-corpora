00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.480
I saw people who were not breathing.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.760
I thought they were asleep.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.376
I still didn't understand what death was,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.920
or killing in itself.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.256
When we would stop
to rest for a little bit

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.216
or search for food,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.176
I would close my eyes,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.736
hoping when I opened them,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.160
I would be awake.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.840
I had no idea which direction was home.
