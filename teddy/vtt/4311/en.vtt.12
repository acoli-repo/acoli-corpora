You need a binary.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.336
Are we there yet, or are we not there yet?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.616
It needs to be credible.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.896
Somebody seeing the project plan
that you're posting needs to see

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.016
that, yes, this project plan will take us

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.216
from where we are to where we want to be.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.536
You need to break it down into subgoals

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.456
that each by themselves
are seen as doable,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.896
and when you add the subgoals together,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.416
we've gone to where we want.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.656
It needs to be --

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.096
and this is where it gets exciting
in terms of working swarmwise --

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.976
it needs to be inclusive.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.656
Anybody who sees this project plan
needs to immediately say,
