It was not abused once.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.456
Everybody had the key
to the treasure chest.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.576
It was not abused one single time.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.496
Turns out when you give people
the keys to the castle,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.000
and look them in the eye
and say, "I trust you,"

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.080
they step up to the plate.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.320
And that's a beautiful thing
to see happen.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.736
Obviously, not everything
went according to plan,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.176
but that's a different thing.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.616
We made mistakes.
We should expect mistakes.
