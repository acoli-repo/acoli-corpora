00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.040
But it works!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.296
What you need to do
is to put a stake in the ground.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.456
You need to announce your goal.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.440
Just say, "I want to accomplish this."

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.880
I'm going to do this.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.240
And it doesn't need to be very costly.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.880
My announcement was
just two lines in a chat channel.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.416
"Hey, look, the Pirate Party
has its website up now after New Year's."

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.656
And the address.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.616
That was all the advertising I ever did.
