It's about deciding what you want to do
and telling it to the world.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.880
Because no matter whether you think
you can or cannot change the world,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.960
no matter whether you think
you can or cannot change the world,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.480
you are probably right.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.456
So one question I want everybody here
to ask themselves today

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.920
is the observation that change doesn't
just happen, somebody makes it happen --

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.000
do you want to be that person?
