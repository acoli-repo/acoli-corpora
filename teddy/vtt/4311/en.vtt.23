00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.616
We made mistakes.
We should expect mistakes.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.296
If you're pioneering something,
that means you must, by definition,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.176
venture into the unknown.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.296
When you're trying the unknown,
some things won't go as planned.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.216
That's part of the definition
of venturing into the unknown.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.336
To find the great,
you must allow mistakes to happen.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.216
So you must communicate
that we expect some things to go wrong

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.080
to create a risk-positive environment.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.280
Therefore we optimize for iteration speed.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.216
Meaning that we try, we fail,
we try again, we fail faster,
