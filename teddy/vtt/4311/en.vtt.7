When I speak to businesspeople,
I frequently make them very upset

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.456
when I contradict them

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.640
and say that no, your employees
are not your most valuable asset.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.096
Your most valuable asset
is the thousands of people

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.736
who want to work for you for free.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.160
And you don't let them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.520
They get very upset about that.
