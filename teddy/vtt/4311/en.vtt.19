00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.680
and each of these are in complete opposite
to what you learn at a business school.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.800
But it works.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.816
We know it works.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.720
We have people in many, many
parliaments to prove it.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.680
Those three factors are:
speed, trust and scalability.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.656
We optimize for speed
by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.536
cutting them out of the decision loop.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.040
That means cutting yourself
out of the decision loop,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.656
which can be hard.
