00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.880
So we've been talking a lot
about the big picture today.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.136
You can use these swarm methods
for a lot of stuff.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.016
Do you want to change the world?

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.536
Do you want to bring clean water
to a billion people?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.256
Teach three billion people to read?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.856
Maybe you're into social change;

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.496
you want to introduce
unconditional basic income.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.640
Or maybe you want
to take humanity to Mars.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.800
You can do this using these methods.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.776
You can do this.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.016
It's about leadership.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.640
It's about deciding what you want to do
and telling it to the world.
