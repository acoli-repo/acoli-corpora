A swarm is a congregation
of tens of thousands of volunteers

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.840
that have chosen of their own will
to converge on a common goal.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.960
There's this "Futurama" quote:

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.880
"When push comes to shove,
you gotta do what you love --

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.616
even if it's not a good idea."

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.456
(Laughter)

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.696
I mean, seriously,
what kind of idiot thinks

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.880
they can change the world
by starting a political party?

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.016
(Laughter)

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.816
This kind of idiot, apparently.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.040
But it works!
