00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.936
This is actually the first time ever
that does not match.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
It was practically everybody.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.896
So, for those who haven't heard of us:

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280
well, the Pirate Party, we love the net.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.360
We love copying and sharing,
and we love civil liberties.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.960
For that, some people call us pirates.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.896
Probably in an attempt to make us
bow our heads and feel shame.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.256
That didn't work very well.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.536
We decided to stand tall about it instead.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.256
And so in 2006,
I founded a new political party.
