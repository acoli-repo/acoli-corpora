00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.480
who try out different methods
of working toward the goal.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.936
Some of them will work

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.016
but in order to find the great ones,
you need this diversity.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.496
And you need to communicate
that we need that diversity.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.176
If somebody on this side
does not understand

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.640
what those guys are doing,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.456
that's OK because we all trust each other
to work for the better of the movement.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.936
And it's OK that I don't understand
their social context.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.536
I'm not expected to --
I understand my social context.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.240
I contribute with something I know.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.456
Make people aware of this diversity.
