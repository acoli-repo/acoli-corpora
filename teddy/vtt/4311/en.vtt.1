I love seeing my name on Twitter.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.256
So ...

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.720
Hi! I'm Rick.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.720
I'm a politician.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.640
I'm sorry.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.616
How many in here have heard
of the Swedish Pirate Party before?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.920
Let's see a show of hands.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.856
OK, that's practically everybody.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.496
Probably due to the fact
that we are Sweden's neighbor.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.096
I frequently ask how many have heard
of any other political party

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.736
and there's always
just scattered hands in the audience

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.216
compared to this first question
which is one-half to two-thirds.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.936
This is actually the first time ever
that does not match.
