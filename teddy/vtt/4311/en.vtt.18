00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.456
So, where that motivation talk ends,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.896
what it doesn't answer is,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.800
how do you build an organization
that harnesses this motivational power.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.176
And this is where
working swarmwise comes in,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.656
this is where swarm intelligence comes in.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.640
