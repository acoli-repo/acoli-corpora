This one-brand-fits-all message --

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.296
forget it!

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.416
That's what they teach you
at business school -- it doesn't work.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.616
Or at least, it doesn't give you
the cost-efficiency advantage

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.880
of working swarmwise.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.816

approaches tried in parallel

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.456
in different social groups

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.480
who try out different methods
of working toward the goal.
