00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.576
A lot of people
kind of balk at the obstacles.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.056
We're going to climb a huge mountain.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.296
So how do you motivate people to do that?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.280
Well, it turns out
that obstacles are not the problem.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.936
Not knowing the obstacles is the problem.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.776
If you know how high the mountain is,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.336
you know exactly
what it takes to scale it.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.000
We know exactly how far away Mars is
and what it takes to get there.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.640
If you can plan it like a project,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.736
you can plan what resources you need

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.616
and you can execute it,
exactly like a project.
