00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.256
And so in 2006,
I founded a new political party.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.536
I led it for its first five years.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.936
And the European elections,
the last European elections,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.376
we became the largest party

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840
and the most coveted
youth demographic, sub-30.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.936
And what's interesting is we did that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.400
on less than one percent
of the competition's budget.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.520
We had a campaign budget
total of 50,000 euros.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.800
They had six million between them --
and we beat them.
