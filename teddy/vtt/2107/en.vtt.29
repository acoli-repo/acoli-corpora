It's not just my work in amphibians,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and in rats, an absence of sperm

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in the testicular tubules as well.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but just by coincidence,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
my colleague has shown

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
have significantly more atrazine in their urine.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
These are just men who live

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
in an agricultural community.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Men who actually work in agriculture

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
have much higher levels of atrazine.
