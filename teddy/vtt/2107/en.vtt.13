that BPA leaches from babies' bottles

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
into the formula, into the milk,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and therefore into the babies.

sippy cups are those little plastic things

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that your child graduates to after using bottles.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But just two weeks before that,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
