00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
by things that we're putting into the environment today.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
PCBs, DDT

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
cross the placenta

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and effectively determine

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the likelihood of developing breast cancer

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and obesity and diabetes

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
already when the baby's in the womb.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
In addition to that, after the baby's born,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
our other unique invention as mammals

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We already know that chemicals

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
like DDT and DES and atrazine

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
can also pass over into milk,
