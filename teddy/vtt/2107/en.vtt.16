00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and leading that loss are amphibians.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
80 percent of all amphibians

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
are threatened and in come decline.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I believe, many scientists believe

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that pesticides are an important part of that decline.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
no eggshells, no membranes

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and no placenta.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
one of our big inventions was the placenta.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But it turns out that this ancient structure
