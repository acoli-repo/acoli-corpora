00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it's interesting for me,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and talk to an audience about these things,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that probably one of the most important people in the world

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who can discuss toxicity in babies

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is expert in frogs.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that I would be talking about pesticides,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that I'd be talking about public health,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)
