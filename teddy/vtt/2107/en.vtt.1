00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in breast cancer tumors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That was the start of my journey

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to make this film, "Toxic Baby."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it doesn't take much time

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to discover some really astonishing statistics

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with this issue.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
One is that you and I all have

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
between 30 to 50,000 chemicals

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in our bodies

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that our grandparents didn't have.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And many of these chemicals

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of chronic childhood disease

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that we're seeing across industrialized nations.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'll show you some statistics.
