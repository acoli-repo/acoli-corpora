Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
No, I'm just joking.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's interesting, because it was six years ago

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when I was pregnant with my first child

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I discovered

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that the most commonly used preservative

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in baby care products

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
mimics estrogen

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when it gets into the human body.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now it's very easy actually

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to get a chemical compound from products

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
into the human body through the skin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And these preservatives had been found

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in breast cancer tumors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That was the start of my journey
