WEBVTT

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and promotes tumors in rats

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What's interesting is, in fact,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the breast cancer promoter,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And so I find it interesting

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that instead of treating this disease

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
we simply respond

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
by putting more chemicals into the environment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
PJC: So speaking of estrogen,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film
