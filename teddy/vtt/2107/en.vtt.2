00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'll show you some statistics.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So for example, in the United Kingdom,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the incidence of childhood leukemia

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's a four-fold increase.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Again, similar story around the world.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the United States,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
probably the most astonishing statistic

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is a 600 percent increase

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in autism and autistic spectrum disorders

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and other learning disabilities.
