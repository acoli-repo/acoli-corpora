00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Men who actually work in agriculture

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
have much higher levels of atrazine.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And the men who actually apply atrazine

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
have even more atrazine in their urine,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
are present in the urine of these men.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
which was originally used as a nerve gas.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And many of these workers

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
have life expectancies of only 50.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife
