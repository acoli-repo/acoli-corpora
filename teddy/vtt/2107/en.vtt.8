00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
some of the males grow up

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and completely become females.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
even though they're genetic males.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
What we proposed,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and what we've now generated support for,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is that what atrazine is doing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Normally the testes should make testosterone,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the male hormone.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the machinery if you will, aromatase,
