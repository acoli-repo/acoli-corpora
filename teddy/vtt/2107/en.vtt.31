It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
are also a warning to us,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
the agricultural runoff from this crop,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
which goes into these buckets,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Now if I told the men in this village

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
that the frogs have pour immune function

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and eggs developing in their testes,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the connection between environmental health and public health

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
would be clear.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
on the wildlife that lived in it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
The problem is, in my village, Oakland,
