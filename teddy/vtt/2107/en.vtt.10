00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and that estrogen turns on or promotes

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the growth of that cancer

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that the latest treatment for breast cancer

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is a chemical called letrozole,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now what's interesting is, of course,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
turns on aromatase, increases estrogen

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and promotes tumors in rats
