In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
bursting through the surface of this male's testes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
would probably be somewhere in the top five.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
In recent studies that we've published,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
some of the males grow up
