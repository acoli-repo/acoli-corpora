TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
for me to be here at TEDWomen

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The truth is, women,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to Sandra Steingraber's books

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --
