00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but in that same year,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We were a bit surprised when we found out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that when we exposed frogs

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that it produced animals that look like this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
These are the dissected gonads of an animal

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that has two testes, two ovaries,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
another large testis, more ovaries,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which is not normal ...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
(Laughter)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
even for amphibians.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog
