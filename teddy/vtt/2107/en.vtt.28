00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
perhaps it's that connection

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that makes women activists

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in this particular area.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But for the men here, I want to say

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
it's not just women and children that are at risk.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the testes are full of holes and spaces,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
because the hormone imbalance,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
instead of allowing sperm to be generated,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
such as in the testis here,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the testicular tubules end up empty

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's not just my work in amphibians,
