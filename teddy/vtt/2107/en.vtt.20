can also pass over into milk,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
again, affecting our babies

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
even after their born.

PJC: So when Tyrone tells me

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that the placenta is an ancient organ,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
How do you show that?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And it's interesting when you make a film like this,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
because you're stuck trying to visualize science

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that there's no visualization for.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.
