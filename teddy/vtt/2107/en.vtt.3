00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and other learning disabilities.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Again, we're seeing that trend

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
across Europe, across North America.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And in Europe,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
there's certain parts of Europe,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
where we're seeing a four-fold increase

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in certain genital birth defects.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Interestingly, one of those birth defects

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So a real skyrocketing

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of chronic childhood disease

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that includes other things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
like obesity and juvenile diabetes,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
premature puberty.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it's interesting for me,
