00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But it turns out that this ancient structure

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that separates us from other animals, the placenta,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
cannot evolve or adapt fast enough

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that it's never seen before.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Of those rats that don't abort,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
atrazine causes prostate disease

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in the pups so the sons

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
are born with an old man's disease.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Of those that don't abort,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development
