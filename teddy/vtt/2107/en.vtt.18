00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in the exposed daughters in utero,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
so that their breast don't develop properly.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And as a result, when those rats grow up,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
their pups experience retarded growth and development

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that its grandmother was exposed to.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And given the life of many of these chemicals,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
generations, years, dozens of years,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that means that we right now

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are affecting the health

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
by things that we're putting into the environment today.
