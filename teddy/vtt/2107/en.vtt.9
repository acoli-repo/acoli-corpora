00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the machinery if you will, aromatase,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that converts testosterone into estrogen.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And as a result, these exposed males

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and they're subsequently feminized

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
because now they're making the female hormone.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Because it turns out

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and that estrogen turns on or promotes
