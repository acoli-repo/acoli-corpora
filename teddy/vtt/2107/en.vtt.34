00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
is that it's going to be us moving forward

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And my urging is

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that when we think about environmental issues

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
but it's also about our children as well.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Thank you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
