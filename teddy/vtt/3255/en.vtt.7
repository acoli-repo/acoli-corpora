00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.254
And especially a section of your body ...

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.995
your hips.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.273
(Laughter)

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.620
Alright?

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:40.123
OK, you know your pelvis
is the center of your body

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:44.933
and this is the intersection
that makes you really strong, alright?

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:46.188
(Laughter)

00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:48.566
OK, so it's super easy.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.406
We're going to roll our hips together, OK?

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.137
So please stand up.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.830
(Laughter)

00:03:56.854 --> 00:03:58.142
It's really easy.

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:02.271
You're just going to have
to roll your hips like that.
