00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.248
Hello, how are you?

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:32.287
Hello, how are you?

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:33.463
Hello, how --

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:36.324
Hey! I speak a little bit --

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.136
you don't understand,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.154
but I speak a little bit

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:42.411
and I'm sure you are my friend.

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:44.760
You are my friend,

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:46.811
You are my friend,

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.998
You are my friend,

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:50.551
You are my --

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:51.762
I love people.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:54.691
I think it's great
we're all hugging here,

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.754
as we mix our vowels,

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:58.762
and we make the saddle.

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:02.890
I appreciate less the consonants
of those we haven't sounded.
