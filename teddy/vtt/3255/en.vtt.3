I love people.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.474
I think it's great
we're all hugging here,

00:01:48.498 --> 00:01:50.585

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.581
that are making the saddle.

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:56.779
I appreciate less the consonants
of those we haven't sounded.

00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:58.770
I'm pressing the buzzer;

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:00.869
I am interpassionate.
