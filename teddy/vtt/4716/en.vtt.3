00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.648
it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:34.128
and looks tiny by comparison.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.096
Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.515
If you've ever tried to draw in perspective,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.864
you know that the closer something is to the horizon,

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:43.818
the smaller you should draw it.

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:46.593
Our brain compensates automatically for this

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.706
by perceiving objects near the horizon

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:50.876
as larger than they actually appear.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.787
The two yellow lines in this drawing

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:53.904
are the same size,

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:55.572
but the upper one seems bigger

00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:57.412
because we interpret it as receding

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.042
farther into the horizon.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:01.379
So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus,
