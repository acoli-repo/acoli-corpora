00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.172
Have you ever noticed

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:12.570
how the full moon looks bigger

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.042
when it's near the horizon

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.976
than when it's high over head?

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.530
If so, you're not alone.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.730
People have wondered about this strange effect

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.105
since ancient times,

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.600
and surprisingly, we still don't have

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.315
a great explanation,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.358
but that's not for lack of trying.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.626
Some of the greatest minds in history -

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:29.395
Aristotle,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.084
Ptolemy,
