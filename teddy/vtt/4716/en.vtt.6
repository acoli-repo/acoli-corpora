00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.108
and their apparent size

00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:03.064
by the focus of our eyes.

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:04.528
When looking at the horizon,

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:06.861
your eyes focus far off into the distance

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.200
so your brain knows you're looking far away.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.178
The moon appears a certain size.

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:12.860
Your brain thinks it's far away,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.705
which it is,

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.585
so you naturally conclude the moon must be big.

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:18.619
But when looking up at the night sky,

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.505
there's nothing for your eyes to focus on,

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.344
so they default to their rest focus,

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:25.261
which is a point just a few meters away.

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:27.185
Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.343
than it really is,

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:29.430
so you naturally conclude

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.169
the moon's not as big as you thought it was.
