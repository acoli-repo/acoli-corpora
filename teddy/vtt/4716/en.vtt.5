00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.196
then we'd expect the moon illusion

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:33.488
to be visible inside a planetarium,

00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:34.449
where the whole sky,

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.619
including the horizon,

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.789
is displayed on a spherical dome overhead.

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.430
Studies have shown, though,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.141
that this is not the case.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.257
To make matters worse,

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:45.929
it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.011
if you just bend over

00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.071
and look at the moon between your legs.

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.379
Now, this is just getting ridiculous!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.551
One of the most promising explanations today

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:57.384
is known as Convergence Micropsia.

00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:59.568
Our brains judge the distance to objects

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.108
and their apparent size
