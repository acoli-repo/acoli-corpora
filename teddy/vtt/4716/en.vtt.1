Ptolemy,

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:30.816
Da Vinci,

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:31.560
Decartes

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.286
- have all wrestled with this problem

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:36.645
and failed to generate an adequate explanation.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.317
One of the first ideas suggested

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:40.426
was that the image of the moon in the sky

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:42.797
really is bigger near the horizon.

00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.728
Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens,

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:48.343
magnifying the moon as it rises and sets.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:50.680
But this explanation doesn't cut it.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.816
If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:55.100
would make the moon look slightly smaller.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.561
Plus, if you actually measure

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:57.926
the size of the visible moon

00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.940
at different positions,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.594
it doesn't change at all.
