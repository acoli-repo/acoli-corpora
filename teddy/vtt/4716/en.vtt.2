00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.594
it doesn't change at all.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.438
But then, why does it still seem bigger

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.822
when it's rising?

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.141
This must be some kind of optical illusion.

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.207
The question is, which one?

00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:11.113
One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.327
where two identical objects look different

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:14.796
because of the relative size

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:17.100
of the objects they're surrounded by.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.295
Here the two center circles are actually the same size.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.323
Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:25.206
because it's next to tiny trees,

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:25.843
houses,

00:01:25.843 --> 00:01:27.680
and towers in the distance.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.143
But when the moon is higher up,

00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.648
it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky
