00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.169
the moon's not as big as you thought it was.

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.811
Rather than explain why the moon

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.639
looks so big near the horizon,

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.432
Convergence Microspia explains

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:40.312
why the moon looks so small when overhead.

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:42.125
Still not satisfied?

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.851
Well, frankly, neither are many scientists,

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.841
so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.346
and may continue as long as we still see it

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:51.440
in the night sky.
