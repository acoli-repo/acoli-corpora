00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:01.379
So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus,

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.911
it seems like we've solved the mystery

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.995
of the moon illusion,

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.375
but, unfortunately, there are a few details

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.354
that complicate things.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.352
For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect,

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:12.884
then we would expect the moon illusion

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.112
to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:18.066
since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.599
near the horizon.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.603
But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:24.825
still claim to see the moon illusion.

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:27.525
On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.663
the size of objects near the horizon,

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.196
then we'd expect the moon illusion
