00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.934
Now, I know it might be easy to think

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:05.851
that microbes are bad,

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.268
especially for infants,

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:11.125
but research has in fact
proven the opposite.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.393
And the truth might be
a little bit more complex,

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.542
but it's actually way more interesting.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.851
It seems that we need microbes

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.000
to be programmed for good health,

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.809
but not just any microbes,

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.226
we need the right combination.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.934
We succeed best
with the little microbial bodies
