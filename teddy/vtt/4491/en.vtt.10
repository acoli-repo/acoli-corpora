00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:01.120
by outfitting them with LED grow lights

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:04.437
that they're now making
open source and part of the project.

00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:06.830
So window farms have been evolving

00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:10.144
through a rapid versioning process
similar to software.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.309
And with every open source project,

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.047
the real benefit is the interplay

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:19.510
between the specific concerns
of people customizing their systems

00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:21.353
for their own particular concerns,

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.425
and the universal concerns.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.382
So my core team and I

00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:27.956
are able to concentrate
on the improvements

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.224
that really benefit everyone.
