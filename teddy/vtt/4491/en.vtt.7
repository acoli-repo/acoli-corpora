00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.950
and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:32.453
But the first few systems

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:36.008
were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:38.790
that Martha Stewart
would definitely never have approved.

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:40.662
(Laughter)

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:43.071
So to bring on more codevelopers,

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.997
what we did was we created
a social media site

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.966
on which we published the designs,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.984
we explained how they worked,

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:52.387
and we even went so far

00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:55.655
as to point out everything
that was wrong with these systems.

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.047
And then we invited people
all over the world

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.167
to build them and experiment with us.
