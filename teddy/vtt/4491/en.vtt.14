WEBVTT

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:00.615
And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.418
has moved beyond
just window farms and LEDs

00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:07.870
into solar panels and aquaponic systems.

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:12.551
And we're building upon innovations
of generations who went before us.

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.389
And we're looking ahead at generations

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:17.333
who really need us
to retool our lives now.

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:20.180
So we ask that you join us

00:07:20.204 --> 00:07:24.530
in rediscovering the value
of citizens united,

00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:28.350
and to declare
that we are all still pioneers.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.198
