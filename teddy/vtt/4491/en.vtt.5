Now light and temperature vary
with each window's microclimate,

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:35.796
so a window farm requires a farmer,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.317
and she must decide

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.076
what kind of crops she is going
to put in her window farm,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.009
and whether she is going
to feed her food organically.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.184
Back at the time,

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:49.389
a window farm was no more
than a technically complex idea

00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:51.604
that was going to require
a lot of testing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750
And I really wanted it
to be an open project,

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:55.976
because hydroponics

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.716
is one of the fastest
growing areas of patenting

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.402
in the United States right now,
