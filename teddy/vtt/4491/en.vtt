00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:02.769
I, like many of you,

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:08.840
am one of the two billion people
on Earth who live in cities.

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:12.390
And there are days --
I don't know about the rest of you --

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:15.976
but there are days when I palpably feel

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.477
how much I rely on other people

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.854
for pretty much everything in my life.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.013
And some days, that can even
be a little scary.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.778
But what I'm here
to talk to you about today

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:29.584
is how that same interdependence

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:34.097
is actually an extremely
powerful social infrastructure
