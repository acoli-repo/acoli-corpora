00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.224
that really benefit everyone.

00:05:30.248 --> 00:05:33.467
And we're able to look out
for the needs of newcomers.

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.221
So for do-it-yourselfers,

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:39.367
we provide free,
very well-tested instructions

00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:41.476
so that anyone, anywhere around the world,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.649
can build one of these systems for free.

00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:46.395
And there's a patent pending
on these systems as well

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.186
that's held by the community.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.114
And to fund the project,

00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:52.440
we partner to create products

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:55.341
that we then sell
to schools and to individuals

00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:57.863
who don't have time
to build their own systems.

00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:02.201
Now within our community,
a certain culture has appeared.
