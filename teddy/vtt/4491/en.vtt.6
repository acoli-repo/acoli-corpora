00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.402
in the United States right now,

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:04.097
and could possibly become
another area like Monsanto,

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.161
where we have a lot of corporate
intellectual property

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:09.510
in the way of people's food.

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:13.735
So I decided that,
instead of creating a product,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.926
what I was going to do

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.000
was open this up
to a whole bunch of codevelopers.

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.121
The first few systems that we created,
they kind of worked.

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:24.479
We were actually able to grow
about a salad a week

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.893
in a typical New York City
apartment window.

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:28.946
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.950
and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
