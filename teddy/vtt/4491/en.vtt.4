00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.026
my apartment has got to be
about as foreign as outer space.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.511
But I can offer some natural light

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:04.555
and year-round climate control.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.926
Fast-forward two years later:

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.674
we now have window farms,

00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:10.751
which are vertical, hydroponic platforms

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:13.093
for food-growing indoors.

00:02:13.624 --> 00:02:16.379
And the way it works
is that there's a pump at the bottom,

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.956
which periodically sends this liquid
nutrient solution up to the top,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.624
which then trickles down
through plants' root systems

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:24.789
that are suspended in clay pellets --

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:26.466
so there's no dirt involved.

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:32.014
Now light and temperature vary
with each window's microclimate,
