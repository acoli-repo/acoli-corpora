WEBVTT

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.167
to build them and experiment with us.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.523
So actually now on this website,

00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:06.244
we have 18,000 people.

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:09.698
And we have window farms
all over the world.

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:14.213
What we're doing
is what NASA or a large corporation

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:17.728
would call R&amp;D,
or research and development.

00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:20.665
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y,

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.328
or "research and develop it yourself."

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.824
(Laughter)

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.403
So, for example, Jackson came along

00:04:27.427 --> 00:04:30.578
and suggested that we use air pumps
instead of water pumps.
