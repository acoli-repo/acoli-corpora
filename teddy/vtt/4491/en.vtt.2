00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:01.606
it was the middle of the winter

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.937
and I definitely did not have room
for a lot of dirt

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.090
in my New York City apartment.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:09.080
So I was basically just willing to settle

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:11.050
for just reading the next Wired magazine

00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:13.694
and finding out how the experts
were going to figure out

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.794
how to solve all these problems
for us in the future.

00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:19.067
But that was actually exactly the point

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.377
that Michael Pollan
was making in this article --

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.610
it's precisely when we hand over

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:26.876
the responsibility
for all these things to specialists

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.614
that we cause the kind of messes
that we see with the food system.
