00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:02.201
Now within our community,
a certain culture has appeared.

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:04.938
In our culture,
it is better to be a tester

00:06:04.962 --> 00:06:07.231
who supports someone else's idea

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:09.643
than it is to be just the idea guy.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.577
What we get out of this project
is support for our own work,

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.522
as well as an experience
of actually contributing

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:20.672
to the environmental movement

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:23.623
in a way other than just
screwing in new light bulbs.

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:26.802
But I think that Eleen expresses best

00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:28.303
what we really get out of this,

00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:31.162
which is the actual joy of collaboration.
