Wherever this alternative fuel exists,

00:12:00.765 --> 00:12:04.979
be it in China or Africa,
Southeast Asia or the American heartland,

00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:08.839
we should endeavor to follow it
with capital and with effort,

00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:12.546
driving both economic
and societal impact all over the world.

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:16.656
Just imagine for a minute
what more could be possible

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.566
if the global needs of the underserved
become the primary focus

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.998
of our inventions.

00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:23.640
Thank you.
