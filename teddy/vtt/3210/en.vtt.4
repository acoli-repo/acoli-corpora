00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:02.172
Now, the Chinese internet has developed
in both familiar and unfamiliar ways.

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:04.006
Just like in Silicon Valley,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.331
some of the seismic shifts
in technology and consumer behavior

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.982
have been driven by academic research,

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:11.912
have been driven by enterprise desires,

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:15.647
with the whims of privilege and youth
sprinkled in every once in a while.

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:18.847
I am a product
of the American tech industry,

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.061
both as a consumer and a corporate leader.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.685
So I am well acquainted
with this type of fuel.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.321
But about a year and a half ago,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.734
I moved from my home
in New York City to Hong Kong

00:02:28.758 --> 00:02:31.654
to become the CEO
of the South China Morning Post.
