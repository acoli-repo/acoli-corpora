launched a new service called Hitch,

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:34.244
which matches car owners
who are driving home

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:37.109
with passengers looking
for long-distance routes.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:38.798
In just its third year,

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:42.227
Hitch served 30 million trips
in this past holiday season,

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.465
the longest of which
was further than 1,500 miles.

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.275
That's about the distance
from Miami to Boston.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:54.299
This enormous need of migrant workers
has powered fast upgrade and innovation

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.539
across the country's transport systems.

00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:02.172
Now, the Chinese internet has developed
in both familiar and unfamiliar ways.
