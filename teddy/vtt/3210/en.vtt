Once every 12 months,

00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:05.686
the world's largest human migration
happens in China.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.039
Over the 40-day travel period
of Chinese New Year,

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:11.991
three billion trips are taken,

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.795
as families reunite and celebrate.

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:16.871
Now, the most strenuous
of these trips are taken

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:20.152
by the country's 290 million
migrant workers,

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.702
for many of whom
this is the one chance a year

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.449
to go home and see parents
and their left-behind children.

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:29.988
But the travel options are very limited;
