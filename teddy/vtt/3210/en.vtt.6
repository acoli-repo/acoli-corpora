00:02:58.873 --> 00:03:01.620
or the academic and the unschooled --

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:04.152
these gaps, they form a soil

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:07.791
that's ready for some
incredible empowerment.

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:11.514
So when capital and investment
become focused on the needs of people

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:15.276
who are hanging to the bottom rungs
of an economic ladder,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.639
that's when we start to see the internet
truly become a job creator,

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:22.122
an education enabler

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:24.703
and in many other ways, a path forward.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:29.362
Of course, China is not the only place
where this alternative fuel exists,

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.658
nor the only place where it is possible.
