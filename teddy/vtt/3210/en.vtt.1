00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:33.482
plane tickets cost nearly half
of their monthly salary.

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.420
So most of them, they choose the train.

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.545
Their average journey is 700 kilometers.

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.054
The average travel time
is 15 and a half hours.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:46.307
And the country's tracks
now have to handle 390 million travelers

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.798
every Spring Festival.

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:50.186
Until recently,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.643
migrant workers would have to queue
for long hours -- sometimes days --

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.005
just to buy tickets,

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:57.997
often only to be fleeced by scalpers.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.996
And they still had to deal
with near-stampede conditions
