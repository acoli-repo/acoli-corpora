00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.029
Of course, you cannot observe
the Chinese internet

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.196
without finding widespread censorship

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.474
and very serious concerns
about dystopian monitoring.

00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:39.363
As an example:

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:42.387
China is in the process of rolling out
a social credit rating

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.871
that will cover its entire population,

00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:47.474
rewarding and restricting citizens,

00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:49.641
based on highly
qualitative characteristics

00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:51.465
like honesty and integrity.

00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:54.410
At the same time,

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:56.284
China is deploying facial recognition

00:04:56.308 --> 00:05:00.546
across many of its 170 million
closed-circuit cameras.
