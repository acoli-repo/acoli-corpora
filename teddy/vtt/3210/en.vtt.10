00:04:56.308 --> 00:05:00.546
across many of its 170 million

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:05.911
Artificial intelligence is being used
to predict crime and terrorism

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:07.125
in Xinjiang province,

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:11.285
where the Muslim minority
is already under constant surveillance.

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:16.496
Yet, the internet has continued
to grow, and it is so big --

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.992
much bigger than I think
most of us realize.

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.146
By the end of 2017,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.617
the Chinese internet population
had reached 772 million users.

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:28.656
That's larger than the populations
of the United States, Russia,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.799
of Germany, of the United Kingdom,
of France and Canada combined.
