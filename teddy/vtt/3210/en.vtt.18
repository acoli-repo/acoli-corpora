00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.279
they often have to travel
vast and dangerous distances

00:09:00.303 --> 00:09:01.831
just to get to school.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:03.267
They account for 30 percent

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:06.212
of the country's primary
and high school students.

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:10.013
Ten-year-old Chang Wenxuan
is one of these students.

00:09:10.522 --> 00:09:14.101
He walks an hour each way
every single day to school,

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:17.771
across these deep ravines,
in an isolated landscape.

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:22.236
But when he arrives at the small
farming village in Gansu province,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.254
he will find just two other students
in this entire school.

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:29.762
Now, Chang's school is one
of 1,000 in Gansu alone

00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.328
that has less than five
registered students.
