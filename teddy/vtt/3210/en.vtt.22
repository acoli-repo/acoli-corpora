00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:03.180
So I'm extremely encouraged to find out

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.109
that private investment
in ed-tech in China

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.029
now exceeds one billion dollars a year,

00:11:08.053 --> 00:11:10.903
with another 30 billion dollars
in public funding

00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:13.527
that is committed between now and 2020.

00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:17.950
As the Chinese internet continues to grow,

00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:21.522
even in its imperfection
and restrictions and controls,

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:23.799
the lives of its
once-forgotten populations

00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:25.670
have been irrevocably elevated.

00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:30.236
There is a focus on
populations of need, not of want,
