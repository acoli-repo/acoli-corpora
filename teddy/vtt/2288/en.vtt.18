Third, we need to build
personal leadership in our children early

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.833
to give them an opportunity
to know what it looks like

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:11.234
to call corruption out when they see it,

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:17.777
what it feels like to stand up
and be counted when they're needed

00:09:19.078 --> 00:09:23.077
and, for me, to make the more
and most important connection

00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.146
between human suffering on one hand

00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:30.530
and corruption, greed
and selfishness on the other.
