00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.251
In the 2000s, I joined my mother
in the Green Belt Movement

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:04.686
and witnessed the growth
of the movement's advocacy activities,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.599
its expansion beyond Kenya

00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:12.349
and an extremely important
growing consensus

00:03:12.373 --> 00:03:16.187
around the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize
that she received --

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:21.577
that the environment, democracy
and peace were inextricably linked.

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:27.316
I also learned that what my mother
had faced that many years ago

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.601
trying to protect Karura Forest

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:31.624
was not an isolated incident.
