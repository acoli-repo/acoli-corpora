Or had something you value
forcibly taken from you

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.490

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:11.313
It's violating.

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:16.062
Feelings of fury, of assault

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:17.837

It is corrosive,

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:27.866
it is criminal,

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.186
it is toxic
