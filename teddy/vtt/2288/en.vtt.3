00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:34.077
There was a construction site coming up
right in the middle of the forest.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.187
Government officials
had stolen the forest.

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:46.039
They had divided, sold and gifted
hundreds of parcels of Karura

00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:47.865
to their friends and cronies.

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:51.311
Now in 1977,

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.273
my mother founded the Green Belt Movement

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:56.157
to plant trees across Kenya,

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:58.231
restore green spaces

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:01.590
and protect green spaces,
much like Karura Forest.
