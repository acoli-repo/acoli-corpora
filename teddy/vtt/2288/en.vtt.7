00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:31.624
was not an isolated incident.

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.904
The corruption and greed
that manifested itself then

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.543
is alive and well today,

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.850
from greedy politicians
and public servants

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:44.457
willing to loot public coffers

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:46.663
at their expense.

00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:49.472
Corruption is everywhere.

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:54.487
Now, corruption is devastating
to any economy, democracy

00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:55.940
and the environment.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:59.824
It robs citizens of vital social services

00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:02.681
and renders human life worthless.
