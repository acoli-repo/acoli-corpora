Why does corruption happen
in the first place?

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.256
Do we call it for what it is -- theft --

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.167
or do we gloss over it with other words?

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:16.404
When young children are able to model
what it looks and feels like

00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:19.145
to deal with corruption,

00:08:20.754 --> 00:08:24.171
they are likely, when faced
with a dilemma in their future,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.300
to model what they've been taught.

00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:35.164
Second, we need to teach
character explicitly.
