00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.987
you know the society is broken.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:37.211
In recent years, Kenya has been ranked

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:41.685
amongst the top 10 most corrupt
countries in the world.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.957
Even more frustrating for me
is that Kenya loses

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:51.963
a third of her national budget
to corruption each year.

00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:54.982
That is six billion dollars.

00:04:55.844 --> 00:04:58.502
It is totally unacceptable.

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:04.716
In a country where anti-corruption efforts
have been frustrated and ignored
