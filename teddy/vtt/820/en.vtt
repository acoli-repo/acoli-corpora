00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Most of them are pretty basic.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Number one: don't let go --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
very sure success method.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But really, truly -- often you think about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
letting go way before your body does.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So hang in there,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Number two: hesitation is bad.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,
