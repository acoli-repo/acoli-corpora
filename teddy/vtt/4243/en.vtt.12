00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But now there was potentially this new category of things

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that I could sculpt

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that was different, that I -- you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I have my own R2D2, but that's --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now, this is funny for me:

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But in this case,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,
