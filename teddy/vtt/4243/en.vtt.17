00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
not just a front elevation, but also

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
a side, rear

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and other side elevation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So now, I had all the topology I needed

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to replicate the Maltese Falcon.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I blew all my reference up to full size,
