00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I actually understood the mechanics

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And so button by button,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
with a ruler.
