Built out of words, it is the engine

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that drives the plot of his book and also the movie,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in which another object is created:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then there is this fourth level, which is

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
a whole new object in the world:

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
becomes, in its own right,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
a whole other thing,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a whole new object of desire.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And so now it was time to do some research.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I actually had done some research

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
