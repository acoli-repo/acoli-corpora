who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and he gave them

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.

and it was lovely. It looked really great,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
it was better than anything that I could achieve

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
or obtain out in the world.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But there was a problem. And the problem was that:
