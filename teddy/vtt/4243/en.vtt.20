00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and I can get it glass-smooth.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority
