00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
killed James Elroy's mother.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000

one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
John's Grill, which actually

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
is still a viable San Francisco eatery,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,
