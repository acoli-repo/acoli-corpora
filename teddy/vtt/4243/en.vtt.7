However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to actually be able to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
understand the topology and perhaps replicate it --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I grabbed all the reference,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and I found this lovely piece of reference.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This is someone selling this on eBay;

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it
