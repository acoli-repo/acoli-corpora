00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
why didn't I remember this?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
which I have already done,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
going from a wax master to a bronze master

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and blown this up big enough to make

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a 3D lithography master of this,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and then I will have it done in bronze. Or:

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There are several people who own originals,
