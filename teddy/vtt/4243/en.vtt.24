00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But there was a problem. And the problem was that:

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I wanted the entirety of the object,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I wanted the weight behind the object.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There's this group online that I frequent.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's a group of prop crazies just like me

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
make and travel in information about movie props.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And it turned out that one of the guys there,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
a friend of mine that I never actually met,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He took my master Falcon pattern,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
he actually did lost wax casting
