00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I actually had done some research

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and had downloaded enough pictures to actually

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
have some reasonable reference.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But I discovered,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in researching further,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
really wanting precise reference, that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
one of the original lead birds

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
had been sold at Christie's in 1994,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
who had the original Christie's catalogue,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and in it I found this magnificent picture,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
which included a size reference.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
