00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
which included a size reference.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
a New Jersey editor, actually found this

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
resin Maltese Falcon

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
at a flea market in 1991,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
although it took him five years

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to authenticate this bird to

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the auctioneers' specifications,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because there was a lot of controversy about it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
about the time the movie was made.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
because I can see it compared to this thing,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,
