00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
exactly how long, etc.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I just noticed that as I finished this skull,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
