About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about a cache of dodo bones that was found

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in a pit on the island of Mauritius.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
off the east coast of Madagascar

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where the dodo bird was discovered

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and extinguished, all within about 150 years.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because it meant that they might finally be able

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to assemble a single dodo skeleton.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
See, while museums all over the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --
