00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm a hard-edged model maker.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
especially parts from "Star Wars" --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I can do this stuff all day long.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But you give me something like this --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
this is not my thing --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls
