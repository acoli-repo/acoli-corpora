00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This folder has 17,000 photos --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
over 20 gigabytes of information --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and it's growing constantly.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
maybe,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
