See, while museums all over the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
not even the actual Natural History Museum

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from the bones of a single dodo.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, this isn't exactly true.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The fact is, is that the British Museum

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
up until the 18th century --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it was actually mummified, skin and all --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but in a fit of space-saving zeal,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and they burned the rest in a bonfire.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you go look at their website today,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they'll actually list these specimens, saying,
