No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
into my "Creative Projects" folder --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Any time I have an internet connection,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
there's a sluice of stuff moving into there,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Russian nuclear launch key:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
