00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I thought to myself,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
wouldn't it be great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if I had my own dodo skeleton?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I want to point out here at this point that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I've spent my life obsessed

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
by objects and the stories that they tell,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and this was the very latest one.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I began looking around for --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to see if anyone sold a kit,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
some kind of model that I could get,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.
