00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
with a ruler.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
replicated every last bone and put it in.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And after about six weeks,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I finished, painted, mounted

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
my own dodo skeleton.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You can see that I even made a museum label for it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that includes a brief history of the dodo.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
a museum vitrine.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I don't have the room for this in my house,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but I had to finish what I had started.
