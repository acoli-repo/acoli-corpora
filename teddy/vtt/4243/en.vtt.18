00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I blew all my reference up to full size,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and then I began cutting out the negatives and using

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
those templates as shape references.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I worked out and achieved --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
here's me sitting next to my wife --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it's the only picture I took of the entire process.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
As I moved through, I achieved

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But again, I am not a sculptor,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,
