00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
at this point in time, when I'd finished it,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
this is by far the most accurate

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
representation of the original Maltese Falcon

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is where it gets weird.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of the Black Dahlia.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, James Ellroy believes

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
killed James Elroy's mother.
