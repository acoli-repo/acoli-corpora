00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:09.297
It’s the morning of June 12th, 1944

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:13.760
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic 368 kilometer journey.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.181
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather,

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.894
flying an average of 79 kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:27.607
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the D-Day invasion back to England.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.110
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment.
