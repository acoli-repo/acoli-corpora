00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:02.431
the stock market has schools, careers,
and even whole television channels

00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.276
dedicated to understanding it.

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:07.896
But the modern stock market is 
significantly more complicated

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.916
than its original incarnation.

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:14.086
So how do companies and investors
use the market today?

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:18.746
Let’s imagine a new coffee company 
that decides to launch on the market.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:22.356
First, the company will advertise itself 
to big investors.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.426
If they think the company is a good idea,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.376
they get the first crack at investing,

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:31.236
and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO.
