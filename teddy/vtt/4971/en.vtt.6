00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:03.367
bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies.

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:04.427
And of course,

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:07.877
plenty of investors are simply ready 
to sell valuable stocks

00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:09.947
and pursue personal interests.

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:13.207
All these variables cause day-to-day noise
in the market,

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:16.127
which can make companies appear more
or less successful.

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:17.327
And in the stock market,

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:20.997
appearing to lose value often leads 
to losing investors,

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.817
and in turn, losing actual value.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:26.857
Human confidence in the market has the
power to trigger

00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:30.437
everything from economic booms 
to financial crises.
