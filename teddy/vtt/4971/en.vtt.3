00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:31.236
and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.691
This launches the company onto the 
official public market,

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.461
where any company or individual who 
believes the business could be profitable

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.721
might buy a stock.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:44.281
Buying stocks makes those investors 
partial owners in the business.

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.650
Their investment helps 
the company to grow,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.480
and as it becomes more successful,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.980
more buyers may see potential 
and start buying stocks.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.320
As demand for those stocks increases,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000
so does their price, increasing 
the cost for prospective buyers,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.930
and raising the value of the company's 
stocks people already own.
