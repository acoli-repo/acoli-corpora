In the 1600s

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.320
the Dutch East India Company 
employed hundreds of ships

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.190
to trade gold, porcelain, spices, 
and silks around the globe.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.080
But running this massive 
operation wasn’t cheap.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
In order to fund their expensive voyages,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290
the company turned to private citizens–

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.620
individuals who could invest money 
to support the trip

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.600
in exchange for a share 
of the ship’s profits.
