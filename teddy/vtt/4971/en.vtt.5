00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.090
As stocks are sold and demand 
for the stock goes down,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.480
the stock price falls,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.850
and with it, the company’s market value.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.520
This can leave investors with big losses–

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.840
unless the company starts to look 
profitable again.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.320
This see-saw of supply and demand 
is influenced by many factors.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.337
Companies are under the unavoidable 
influence of market forces–

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:51.757
such as the fluctuating 
price of materials,

00:02:51.757 --> 00:02:53.707
changes in production technology,

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:56.017
and the shifting costs of labor.

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.827
Investors may be worried about 
changes in leadership,

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:03.367
bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies.
