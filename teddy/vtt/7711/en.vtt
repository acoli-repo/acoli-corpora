So, my mother's a pediatrician,

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.786
and when I was young,
she'd tell the craziest stories

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.033
that combined science
with her overactive imagination.

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.775
One of the stories she told
was that if you eat a lot of salt,

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.468
all of the blood rushes up your legs,

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:20.744
through your body,

00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:22.847
and shoots out the top of your head,

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:24.573
killing you instantly.

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:25.657
(Laughter)

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.493
She called it "high blood pressure."

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:29.161
(Laughter)

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.095
This was my first experience
with science fiction,
