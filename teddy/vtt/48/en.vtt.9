00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.976
and what we did was actually say,
"OK, this printer is taking forever, man.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.656
Let's scribble something
that would delight the customer

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.176
on the back of these invoices."

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.336
So we'd say, "Hey,
keep smiling," you know?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.936
"Hey, you're awesome,"

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.416
or, "Hey, enjoy the Doritos,"

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.416
or, "We love Gatorade, too."

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.776
Stuff like that.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.256
And so it started breaking up
the monotony of the job as well

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.656
because I was picking
and packing all of the boxes,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.856
and that's all you basically do
for eight, nine, 10, 12 hours a day

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.536
when you're sitting in the garage.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.376
And so an interesting thing happened.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.360
So we actually started to grow.
