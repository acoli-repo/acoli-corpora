He's a real CEO, this guy.
He's really got it down."

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.296
(Laughter)

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.056
But the reality is this.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.496
I don't have the CEO thing down
100 percent pat,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.136
but I've actually learned
the most fundamentally challenging lesson

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.616
I've ever had to learn,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.176
and that's this.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.816
There is only one solution
to micromanagement ...

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.296
and that's to trust.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.536
Thank you.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.760
