You start managing the people
who manage the people doing the work,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.256
and it's at that point in time,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.416
you start to lose control
over the output of your job.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.496
I've actually witnessed this firsthand.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.936
So, I started a company
called Boxed in our garage,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.656
and this was it --
I know it doesn't seem like much --

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.816
you know, there's a pressure
washer in the back --

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.616
this is "living the dream."

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.296
And my wife was really proud of me
when we started this,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.896
or that's what she said,
she was really proud of me --

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.336
and so she would give me a hug,
and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.296
and she was thinking,
"Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
