00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.136
by breaking up the monotony
in the fulfillment center

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.466
actually became micromanagement,
and people started complaining to HR.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.536
It's like, "Dude, this CEO guy
has got to get out of my hair, OK?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.176
I know how to write a damn note."

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.216
(Laughter)

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.496
So it was at that point in time,
we said, "OK, you know?

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.696
We hired these great, wonderful people,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.456
let's give them the mission
that's 'delight the customer,'

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.176
let's give them the tool to do so,
and that's these notes -- have at it."

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.616
And so what we found
was actually pretty startling.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.296
Some folks actually took the notes

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.296
and actually started drawing
these really ornate minimurals on them.
