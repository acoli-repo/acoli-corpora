00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.096
no one ever jumps to the top
of the totem pole, right?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.936
You start at the very bottom.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.176
Doing what?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.416
Doing work.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.776
You actually do the work, right?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.896
And if you're really good
at doing the work,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.376
what do you get rewarded with?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.616
More work, right?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.336
Yeah, that's right, you guys
are all great micromanagers.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.616
(Laughter)

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.896
You do more work,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.296
and then pretty soon,
if you're really good at it,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.976
you do a little bit of work still,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.656
but actually, you start to manage
people doing the work.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.776
And if you're really good at that,
what happens after that?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.296
You start managing the people
who manage the people doing the work,
