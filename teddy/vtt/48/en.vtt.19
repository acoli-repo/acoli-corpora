00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.376
what is the upside?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.656
Well, we saw the upside
and it's pretty great.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.296
We tasked our engineers and said,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.936
"Hey, some of our fulfillment centers
cost millions of dollars to build,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.896
there's miles and miles of conveyor,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.576
and so, can you do the same thing,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.736
can you make them efficient
without spending millions of dollars?"

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.016
So, they got to work:

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.456
they actually did this --
this is not photoshopped,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.016
the guy is really grinding.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.976
They built an autonomous guided vehicle.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.976
We didn't tell them what to build,
what format it needed to be.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.136
In 90 days they produced
the first prototype:

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.256
powered off Tesla batteries,
stereoscopic cameras, lidar systems.
