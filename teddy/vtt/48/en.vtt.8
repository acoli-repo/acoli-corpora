00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.296
and she was thinking,
"Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.376
It was kind of like a lemonade stand
gone wrong in the beginning,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.616
but we actually went up and said
mobile commerce is going to be big,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.856
and actually consumer packaged goods
were going to change over time,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.256

that you don't want to lug home --

and not the 24-pack
of toilet paper but the 48-pack --

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.576
and let's ship it to you
much like a warehouse club would do

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.336
except they wouldn't ship it to you.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.936
So that's what we basically did.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.376
We had a really slow printer

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.976
and what we did was actually say,
"OK, this printer is taking forever, man.
