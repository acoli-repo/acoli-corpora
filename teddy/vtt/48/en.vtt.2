it was probably when you had someone
looking over your shoulder,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.480
watching your each and every move.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.856
Kind of like my mother-in-law
when she's over right?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.896
(Laughter)

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.616
I'm like, "I got this," you know?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.776
And so there's actually
data to support this.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.776
There was a recent study in the UK.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.936
They took 100 hospital employees,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.616
put an activity tracker on them

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.056
and then let them go about
their next 12-hour shift all alone,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.056
just a regular 12-hour shift.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.616
At the end of the shift,
they asked them, "Do you feel fatigued?"

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.096
And what they found
was actually really interesting.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.536
It wasn't necessarily
the people who moved the most
