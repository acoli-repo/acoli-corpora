00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.656
and I felt a little bit
conflicted in all of this.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.336
And --

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.936
oh, there's a really bad typo --

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.656
so if there was only a red T-E-D on stage
that I counted on being here,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.216
it wouldn't be a typo, right?

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.256
(Laughter)

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.816
(Applause)

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.136
I promised you I had
a really bad sense of humor,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.536
and now I'm gratifying that.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.096
So I told you. But I really
was conflicted, right?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.296
At this point in time,
we started doing things

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.496
that actually weren't part
of our core mission

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.616
and people started failing at it.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.976
And so, I thought,
should we let them fail?
