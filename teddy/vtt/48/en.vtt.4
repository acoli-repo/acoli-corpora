It's one of those questions
you probably don't even need to ask.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.336
It's like, "Do you want to get
your luggage stolen at the airport?"

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.576
Probably not, but I've never
been asked, right?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.015
So has anyone asked you, as a manager,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.856
"Do you want to hire
dull and unimaginative people?"

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.816
So, I don't know, this is TED,
we better back it up with data.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.576
We actually asked hundreds
of people around the country --

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
hundreds of managers across the country --

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.184
do you want to hire
dull and unimaginative people?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.856
Alright, it's an interesting question.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.536
Well, interesting results as well.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.816
So, 94% said no --

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.056
(Laughter)

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.976
we don't want to hire
dull and unimaginative people.
