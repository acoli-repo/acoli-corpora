00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.976
we don't want to hire
dull and unimaginative people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.576
Six percent probably didn't
understand the question --

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.296
(Laughter)

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.576
but, bless their hearts,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.536
maybe they do just want to hire
dull and unimaginative people.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.256
But 94 percent said they did not,
and so why do we do this still then?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.896
Well, I posit that it's something
really, really simple

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.656
that all of us deep down inside know
and have actually felt.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.776
So when we get hired
into an organization --

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.856
it could be a club,
it could be a law firm,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.256
it could be a school organization,
it could be anything --

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.096
no one ever jumps to the top
of the totem pole, right?
