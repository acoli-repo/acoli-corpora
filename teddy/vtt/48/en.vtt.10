00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.376
And so, you know, over the last --

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.736
actually just even 36 months after that,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.016
we ended up selling hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of stuff,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.576
and we actually grew
really, really quickly.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.256
But during that time,
my role started to change, too.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.776
So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage;

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.976
I was picking and packing,
doing all the work,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.216
but then I graduated

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.976
to actually managing the people
who picked and packed,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.976
and then pretty soon I managed the people

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.056
who managed the people
picking and packing.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.456
And even now, I manage the C-staff
who manage the departments

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.856
who manage the people who manage
the people picking and packing.
