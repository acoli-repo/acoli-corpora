who manage the people who manage

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.856
And it is at that point
in time, I lost control.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.536
So I thought, OK, we were delighting
all of these customers with these notes.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.176
They loved them, but I can't
write these notes anymore,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.816
so you know what I'm going to do?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.816
I'm going to tell these folks
how to write these notes.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.776

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.056
this has to be this big,
this has to be that big.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.576
And pretty soon this goal
of raising morale

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.136
by breaking up the monotony
in the fulfillment center
