What I'm really here to do today
is talk to you about micromanagement

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.736
and what I learned about micromanagement

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.456

by telling them what font size to use.

In the history of mankind,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.376
has anyone ever said this?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.856
