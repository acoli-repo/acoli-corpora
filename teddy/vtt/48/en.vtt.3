00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.536
It wasn't necessarily
the people who moved the most

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.936
that felt the most fatigued,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.240
but it was the folks
that didn't have control over their jobs.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.456
So if we know that micromanagement
isn't really effective,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.256
why do we do it?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.976
Is it that the definition is wrong?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.416
I posited that micromanagement

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.456
is just bringing in great,
wonderful, imaginative people

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.936
and then crushing their souls,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.936
so is it that we actually want to hire --

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.336
deep down inside of us --

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.200
dull and unimaginative people?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.136
It's one of those questions
you probably don't even need to ask.
