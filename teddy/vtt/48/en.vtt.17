00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.976
And so, I thought,
should we let them fail?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.880
Should we continue to let them do this?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.895
I don't know --

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.655
I didn't know at that moment,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.456
but I thought this:

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.440
Is failure really that bad?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.416
I'm not saying
we should celebrate failure.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.096
There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley
that says, "Let's celebrate failure."

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.496
No, I don't know
if we would go all the way there,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.376
because like, in our board meetings,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.776
our board members are never like,
"Hey, Chieh, you failed last quarter,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.176
keep doing that, buddy, OK?"

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.456
No one's ever said that.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.576
If you're part of
an organization like that,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.936
give me a call, I want
to sit in on that meeting.
