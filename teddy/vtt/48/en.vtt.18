00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.936
give me a call, I want
to sit in on that meeting.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.616
In private, I don't think
many people celebrate failure,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.216
but failure, I posit,
is actually pretty necessary

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.416
for the folks truly in the long-term,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.216
for the smart and imaginative people

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.096
truly trying to fulfill the mission
that you give them at hand.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.136
And so failure can actually
be seen as a milestone

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.840
along that mission towards success.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.496
And if the downside of not micromanaging

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.856
is potentially this perceived notion
that you might fail more often,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.136
and if it's really not that bad,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.376
what is the upside?
