00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:31.163
it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it.

00:00:31.913 --> 00:00:34.412
Aesthetically speaking,
there's a world of difference

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:37.371
between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber,

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.621
but both artists have used

00:00:38.662 --> 00:00:41.162
the same building blocks
to create their music:

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:42.204
notes.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.871
And although the end result
can sound quite complicated,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.412
the logic behind musical notes
is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:49.454
Let's take a look

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:51.662
at the foundational
elements to music notation

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.621
and how they interact
to create a work of art.

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:59.329
Music is written on five parallel lines
that go across the page.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.912
These five lines are called a staff,
