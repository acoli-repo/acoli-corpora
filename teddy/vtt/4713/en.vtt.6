00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.579
(Ticking)

00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:03.663
Notice that it doesn't change,

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:05.954
it just plugs along quite happily.

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:07.038
It can go slow

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:09.621
or fast

00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:11.913
or whatever you like, really.

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:14.579
The point is that just
like the second hand on a clock

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.163
divides one minute into sixty seconds,

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:20.163
with each second just as long
as every other second,

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:21.954
the beat divides a piece of music

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:25.079
into little fragments of time
that are all the same length:

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.121
beats.

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.538
With a steady beat as a foundation,

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.204
we can add rhythm to our pitches,
