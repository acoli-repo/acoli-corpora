00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.204
pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet,

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:31.704
A, B, C,

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:33.663
D, E, F, and G.

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:36.579
After that, the cycle repeats itself:

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.621
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:39.996
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:41.079
and so on.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.663
But how do these pitches get their names?

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.246
Well, for example, if you played an F

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:47.496
and then played another F

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.204
higher or lower on the piano,

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:51.246
you'd notice that they sound
pretty similar

00:01:51.288 --> 00:01:53.079
compared to, say, a B.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.954
Going back to the staff,

00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:57.663
every line and every space
between two lines

00:01:57.663 --> 00:01:59.329
represents a separate pitch.
