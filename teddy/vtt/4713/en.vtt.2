00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.912
These five lines are called a staff,

00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:04.204
and a staff operates on two axes:

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:05.496
up and down

00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:06.704
and left to right.

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:09.163
The up-and-down axis tells the performer

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.913
the pitch of the note
or what note to play,

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:13.413
and the left-to-right axis

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:15.538
tells the performer the rhythm of the note

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:16.913
or when to play it.

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:18.996
Let's start with pitch.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.038
To help us out,
we're going to use a piano,

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:24.371
but this system works for pretty much
any instrument you can think of.

00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:26.788
In the Western music tradition,

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.204
pitches are named after
the first seven letters of the alphabet,
