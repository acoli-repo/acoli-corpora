00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:01.704
At the beginning of a piece of music,

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:02.829
just after the clef,

00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:04.954
is something called the time signature,

00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:07.996
which tells a performer
how many beats are in each bar.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:10.163
This says there are two beats in each bar,

00:04:10.163 --> 00:04:11.496
this says there are three,

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:13.579
this one four, and so on.

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.871
The bottom number tells
us what kind of note

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.329
is to be used as the basic
unit for the beat.

00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:20.496
One corresponds to a whole note,

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:21.621
two to a half note,

00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:23.538
four to a quarter note,

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.538
and eight to an eighth note, and so on.

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:27.288
So this time signature here

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.079
tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar,
