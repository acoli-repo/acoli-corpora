00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.079
tells us that there are four
quarter notes in each bar,

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.038
one, two, three, four;

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.621
one, two, three, four,

00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:34.704
and so on.

00:04:35.163 --> 00:04:36.329
But like I said before,

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:37.788
if we just stick to the beat,

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.371
it gets kind of boring,

00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.246
so we'll replace some quarter notes
with different rhythms.

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:44.913
Notice that even though
the number of notes

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.413
in each bar has changed,

00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:48.996
the total number of beats
in each bar hasn't.

00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:53.329
So, what does our musical
creation sound like?

00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:55.746
(Music)

00:04:55.746 --> 00:04:59.038
Eh, sounds okay, but maybe
a bit thin, right?

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.954
Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm.
