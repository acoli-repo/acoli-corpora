Let's add another instrument
with its own pitch and rhythm.

00:05:02.413 --> 00:05:04.621
Now it's sounding like music.

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.746
Sure, it takes some practice
to get used to reading it quickly

00:05:08.788 --> 00:05:10.788
and playing what we see on our instrument,

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:12.579
but, with a bit of time and patience,

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.371
you could be the next Beethoven

00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.496
or Justin Bieber.
