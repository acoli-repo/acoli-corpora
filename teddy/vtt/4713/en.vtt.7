00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.204
we can add rhythm to our pitches,

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:32.371
and that's when music
really starts to happen.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.038
This is a quarter note.

00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:36.746
It's the most basic unit of rhythm,

00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:38.288
and it's worth one beat.

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:41.288
This is a half note,
and it's worth two beats.

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.413
This whole note here is worth four beats,

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:45.329
and these little guys are eighth notes,

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.704
worth half a beat each.

00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:49.829
"Great," you say, "what does that mean?"

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.538
You might have noticed
that across the length of a staff,

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:55.204
there are little lines dividing it
into small sections.

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:56.913
These are bar lines

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:59.371
and we refer to each section as a bar.

00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:01.704
At the beginning of a piece of music,
