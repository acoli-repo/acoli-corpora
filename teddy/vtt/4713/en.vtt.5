00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.788
telling you that a particular
line or space

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.579
corresponds to a specific note
on your instrument.

00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:35.954
If we want to play notes
that aren't on the staff,

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:38.121
we kind of cheat and draw
extra little lines

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.329
called ledger lines

00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.079
and place the notes on them.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.454
If we have to draw so many ledger lines
that it gets confusing,

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:46.746
then we need to change
to a different clef.

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.204
As for telling a performer
when to play the notes,

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:52.079
two main elements control this:

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.038
the beat and the rhythm.

00:02:54.454 --> 00:02:56.038
The beat of a piece of music is,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.996
by itself, kind of boring.

00:02:58.038 --> 00:02:59.704
It sounds like this.
