00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:03.121
If we put a note on one of these lines
or one of these spaces,

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.663
we're telling a performer
to play that pitch.

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:07.996
The higher up on the staff
a note is placed,

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:09.413
the higher the pitch.

00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:11.913
But there are obviously
many, many more pitches

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:14.579
than the nine that these
lines and spaces gives us.

00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:16.121
A grand piano, for example,

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:17.829
can play 88 separate notes.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:21.288
So how do we condense
88 notes onto a single staff?

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:23.996
We use something called a clef,

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:26.954
a weird-looking figure
placed at the beginning of the staff,

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.663
which acts like a reference point,

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.788
telling you that a particular
line or space
