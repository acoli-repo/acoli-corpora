When we watch a film or a play,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.996
we know that the actors

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.038
probably learned
their lines from a script,

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:22.329
which essentially tells them
what to say and when to say it.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.246
A piece of written music
operates on exactly the same principle.

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.079
In a very basic sense,

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:31.163
it tells a performer what to play
and when to play it.
