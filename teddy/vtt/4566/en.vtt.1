from a Panamanian-based law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:39.378
The release of these papers from Panama
lifts the veil on a tiny piece

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.640
of the secretive offshore world.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:46.972
We get an insight into how clients
and banks and lawyers

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.024
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.555
and say, "OK, we want
an anonymous company,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.971

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.792
you get to see the exchanges of messages,

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.891
you get to see the mechanics
of how this works,

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.316
how this operates.
