00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:01.086
and none of the lawyers
took us on as a client

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.399
and of course no money moved hands,

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:06.881
but it really shows the problem
with the system.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.824
It's also important

00:05:08.848 --> 00:05:12.214
to not just think about this
as individual cases.

00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:14.451
This is not just about
an individual lawyer

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:18.329
who's spoken to our undercover
investigator and provided suggestions.

00:05:18.353 --> 00:05:21.208
It's not just about
a particular senior politician

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:22.861
who's been caught up in a scandal.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.941
This is about how a system works,

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:31.908
that entrenches corruption,
tax evasion, poverty and instability.
