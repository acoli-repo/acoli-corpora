There's bipartisan legislation
that had been introduced

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:33.585
in the House and the Senate,

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:36.766
but it isn't making as much progress
as we'd like to see.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.877
So we'd really want to see
the Panama leaks,

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:43.695

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:48.771
be used as a way of opening up
in the US and around the world.

00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:53.585
For us at Global Witness,
this is a moment for change.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.698
We need ordinary people to get angry

00:06:57.722 --> 00:07:00.975
at the way in which people
can hide their identity
