An evolutionary biologist
at Purdue University

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.160
named William Muir studied chickens.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.249
He was interested in productivity --

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.539
I think it's something
that concerns all of us --

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.827
but it's easy to measure in chickens
because you just count the eggs.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.527
(Laughter)

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.944
He wanted to know what could make
his chickens more productive,

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:22.870
so he devised a beautiful experiment.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.328
Chickens live in groups, so first of all,
he selected just an average flock,

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:30.718
and he let it alone for six generations.
