At some point,

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:12.207
most sexually active people will be 
infected with human papillomavirus,

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:13.937
or ‘HPV.’

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:16.347
There are over 100 types of HPV,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.247
and most of the time the body 
eliminates infections without symptoms–

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:23.947
but some strains can pose serious 
health risks down the line.

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:26.937
HPV causes contact infections,

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:30.147
which means the virus stays in the cells
near the point of infection
