00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.355
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:06.267
It's a diagram of the visual system.

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:09.017
And some things look very familiar today.

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:13.384
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.504
There's a very large nose

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:18.821
that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.

00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.521
And if we compare this

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.595
to more recent representations of the visual system,

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:25.552
you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:27.125
over the intervening thousand years.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.090
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,
