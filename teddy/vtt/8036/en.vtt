00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.299
Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze,

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.260
Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave.

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:18.139
When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath,

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:20.683
and in one sudden movement,

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:24.228
drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck.

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.692
Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children.
