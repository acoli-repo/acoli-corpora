I'm a computer science professor,

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:05.932
and my area of expertise is

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.131

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:23.117
Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:27.017

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:29.761

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.681
for her to think, because I told her I was working
