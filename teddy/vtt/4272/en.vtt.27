00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:32.243
to determine what the person had been typing.

00:13:32.243 --> 00:13:34.819
Now, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,

00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:37.588
this is a graph of the perturbations that were created

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:40.829
by the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult

00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:43.907
to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.997
but the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,

00:13:46.997 --> 00:13:50.477
and so the same measurement

00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:52.309
produced this graph.

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:54.795
Now that gave you a lot of information while someone

00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:58.036
was typing, and what they did then is used advanced

00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:01.043
artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
