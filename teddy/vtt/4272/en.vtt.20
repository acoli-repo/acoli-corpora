00:09:58.156 --> 00:10:00.307
on their smartphones were typing,

00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:02.567
and then they had a surprising result, which is that

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:05.331
their software had not only done it for their target,

00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:06.734
but other people who accidentally happened

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:08.820
to be in the picture, they were able to produce

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.547
what those people had been typing, and that was kind of

00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:15.164
an accidental artifact of what their software was doing.

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:19.467
I'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:22.267
P25 radios are used by law enforcement

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:25.674
and all kinds of government agencies

00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:27.410
and people in combat to communicate,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.243
and there's an encryption option on these phones.
