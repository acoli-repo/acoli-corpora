00:06:59.172 --> 00:07:02.559
They put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.498
on the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:08.281
like here's a picture of the speedometer

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:11.097
showing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.470
Once you have control of the car's computers,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.389
you can do anything.

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.005
Now you might say, "Okay, that's silly."

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:17.664
Well, what if you make the car always say

00:07:17.664 --> 00:07:20.405
it's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.947
You might produce a lot of speeding tickets.

00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:26.803
Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,

00:07:26.803 --> 00:07:29.548
the target victim car and the chase car,

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:32.294
and they launched a bunch of other attacks.
