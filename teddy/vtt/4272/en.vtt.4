1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.303
hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:08.271
and the technology has continued to move forward.

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:12.904
In 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:16.071
of computer security.

00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:17.412
And why do I say that?

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:20.302
Because that's when implanted devices inside of people

00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:23.047
started to have networking capabilities.

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:24.927
One thing that brings us close to home is we look

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:27.632
at Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:31.501
pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,
