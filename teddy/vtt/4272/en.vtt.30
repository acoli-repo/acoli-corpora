A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.

00:15:00.695 --> 00:15:02.435
It's the Supreme Court, right?

00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.965
And so, together we're able to reproduce typing

00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:07.914
simply by measuring the accelerometer.

00:15:07.914 --> 00:15:11.416
Why does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,

00:15:11.416 --> 00:15:15.549
for example, the developers have a manifest

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:18.148
where every device on there, the microphone, etc.,

00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:20.104
has to register if you're going to use it

00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:22.420
so that hackers can't take over it,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.528
but nobody controls the accelerometer.

00:15:25.528 --> 00:15:27.744
So what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to

00:15:27.744 --> 00:15:29.850
someone's keyboard, and just leave the room,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.489
and then later recover what they did,
