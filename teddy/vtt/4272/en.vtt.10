00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:02.898
So there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,

00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:05.718
there's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.871
that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.677
to a controller on board.

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:14.595
The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device.

00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:17.917
And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.234
Well, that's what the researchers

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:21.105
that I'm going to talk about today did.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:24.082
They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:26.404
and on the wireless network.

00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:29.103
Now, they have two areas they can attack.

00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:31.141
One is short-range wireless, where you can actually
