00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.879
would never know was happening.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:03.013
Am I scaring you yet?

00:09:03.013 --> 00:09:04.956

These are ones where I went to a conference,

00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:08.722

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:24.515
and then they post-processed the video.

00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.978
What you see here in number one is a

00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:31.361
reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone
