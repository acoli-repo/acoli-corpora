artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning

00:14:01.043 --> 00:14:02.474
to have a training phase,

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.710
and so they got most likely grad students

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.499
to type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,

00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:11.267
to have the system use the machine learning tools that

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.130
were available to learn what it is that the people were typing

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.957
and to match that up

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:19.434
with the measurements in the accelerometer.

00:14:19.434 --> 00:14:21.069
And then there's the attack phase, where you get

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.880
somebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.177
but you use your model that you created

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:28.619
in the training phase to figure out what they were typing.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:32.103
They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.
