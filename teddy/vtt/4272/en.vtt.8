00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:01.007
could actually have their performance disrupted

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.658
simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them.

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:06.067
Now, wireless and the Internet

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:07.719
can improve health care greatly.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.806
There's several examples up on the screen

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.913
of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:15.778
inside of people, and all of these devices now,

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.903
it's standard that they communicate wirelessly,

00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:20.315
and I think this is great,

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.420
but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.827
and without understanding what attackers can do

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:27.974
and the security risks from the beginning,

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:30.364
there's a lot of danger in this.
