00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.910
Well, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.437
of vulnerability in the software, something like that.

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.640
You use the GPS in the car to locate it.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.835
You remotely unlock the doors through the computer

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:40.973
that controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,

00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:42.641
and you've got yourself a car.

00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.128
Surveillance was really interesting.

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:48.337
The authors of the study have a video where they show

00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:50.886
themselves taking over a car and then turning on

00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:53.647
the microphone in the car, and listening in on the car

00:08:53.647 --> 00:08:56.998
while tracking it via GPS on a map,

00:08:56.998 --> 00:08:58.711
and so that's something that the drivers of the car

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.879
would never know was happening.
