there's a lot of danger in this.

00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:31.841
Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target.

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.929
I'm going to show you a few different targets like this,

and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles.

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:39.742
This is a car, and it has a lot of components,

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:41.362
a lot of electronics in it today.

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:45.739
In fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:48.894

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.964
There's also a wireless network in the car,

00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:59.197
which can be reached from many different ways.

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:02.898
So there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,
