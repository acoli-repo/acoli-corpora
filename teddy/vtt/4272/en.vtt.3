00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:31.501
have performed, which I don't think

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.709
most people know about,

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.737
and I think they're very interesting and scary,

Now medical devices have come a long way technologically.

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:59.199
You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:02.751
1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,
