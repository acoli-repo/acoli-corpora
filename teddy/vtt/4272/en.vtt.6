00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.324
every time you want to reprogram their device

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:02.779
or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.881
to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:08.491
is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,

00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:10.363
and they built the device you see pictured here,

00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:13.123
with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:17.598
to the device, and thus control it.

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.287
In order to make their experience real -- they were unable

00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:22.759
to find any volunteers, and so they went

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.903
and they got some ground beef and some bacon

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:26.691
and they wrapped it all up to about the size

00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:29.489
of a human being's area where the device would go,

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.943
and they stuck the device inside it
