00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.943
and they stuck the device inside it

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:34.075
to perform their experiment somewhat realistically.

00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:37.095
They launched many, many successful attacks.

00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:40.151
One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.144
I don't know why you would want to do that,

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:43.248
but I sure wouldn't want that done to me.

00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:45.579
And they were able to change therapies,

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.074
including disabling the device -- and this is with a real,

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:49.970
commercial, off-the-shelf device --

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.016
simply by performing reverse engineering and sending

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:55.005
wireless signals to it.

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.585
There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:01.007
could actually have their performance disrupted
