00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:30.893
They went and reported this to the law enforcement

00:12:30.893 --> 00:12:32.916
agencies, after anonymizing it,

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:35.916
and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.310
wasn't good enough. If you're talking

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.126
about something really secure and sensitive, it should

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.419
be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.

00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:45.305
That one's pretty easy to fix.

00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:46.974
The last one I thought was really, really cool,

00:12:46.974 --> 00:12:49.787
and I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something

00:12:49.787 --> 00:12:50.792
that you're going to lose sleep over

00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:52.583
like the cars or the defibrillators,

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:55.606
but it's stealing keystrokes.

00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:58.353
Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.

00:12:58.353 --> 00:13:00.543
Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone,
