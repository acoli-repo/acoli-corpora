00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:31.501
pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.684
and as you can see at the bottom there,

00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:35.693
it was controlled by a computer controller,

00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:38.210
and if you ever thought that software liability

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.799
was very important, get one of these inside of you.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.494
Now what a research team did was they got their hands

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:46.914
on what's called an ICD.

00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:48.984
This is a defibrillator, and this is a device

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:53.320
that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.658
and these have saved many lives.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.130
Well, in order to not have to open up the person

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.324
every time you want to reprogram their device
