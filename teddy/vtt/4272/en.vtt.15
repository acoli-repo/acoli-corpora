00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:32.294
and they launched a bunch of other attacks.

00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:35.060
One of the things they were able to do from the chase car

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.034
is apply the brakes on the other car,

00:07:37.034 --> 00:07:38.594
simply by hacking the computer.

00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:41.025
They were able to disable the brakes.

00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:44.203
They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in

00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:46.628
and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like

00:07:46.628 --> 00:07:50.374
going over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.132
The results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:54.848
even though they gave this talk at a conference

00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:56.574
to a bunch of computer security researchers,

00:07:56.574 --> 00:07:58.274
everybody was gasping.

00:07:58.274 --> 00:08:01.973
They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers
