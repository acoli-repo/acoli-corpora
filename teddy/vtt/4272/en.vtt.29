They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.

00:14:32.103 --> 00:14:34.712
They typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled

00:14:34.712 --> 00:14:37.674
that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago"

00:14:37.674 --> 00:14:39.028
— see, I tied it in to the last talk —

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:41.146
"and ordered him to stay on the ballot."

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.917
Now, the system is interesting, because it produced

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:46.803
"Illinois Supreme" and then it wasn't sure.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.753
The model produced a bunch of options,

00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:51.462
and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,

00:14:51.462 --> 00:14:53.712
is that computers are good at some things,

00:14:53.712 --> 00:14:55.246
humans are good at other things,

00:14:55.246 --> 00:14:57.177
take the best of both and let the humans solve this one.

00:14:57.177 --> 00:14:58.559
Don't waste computer cycles.

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.695
A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.
