Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone,

00:13:00.543 --> 00:13:05.155
and we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,

00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:08.363
the camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point

00:13:08.363 --> 00:13:09.943
had looked at the accelerometer.

00:13:09.943 --> 00:13:11.590
The accelerometer is the thing that determines

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.084
the vertical orientation of the smartphone.

00:13:15.084 --> 00:13:16.501
And so they had a simple setup.

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:19.259
They put a smartphone next to a keyboard,

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.971
and they had people type, and then their goal was

00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:24.827
to use the vibrations that were created by typing

00:13:24.827 --> 00:13:29.067
to measure the change in the accelerometer reading

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:32.243
to determine what the person had been typing.
