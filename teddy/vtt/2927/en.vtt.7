that other groups are not offering?

00:03:30.687 --> 00:03:33.250
And actually, this is usually
very positive things,

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:35.291
very seemingly empowering things,

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.778
such as brotherhood and sisterhood

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:39.136
and a sense of belonging,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.034
as well as giving somebody
a spiritual purpose,

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:45.773
a divine purpose
to build a utopian society

00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:47.718
if their goals can be met,

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:50.493
but also a sense of empowerment
and adventure.

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:52.560
When we look
at foreign terrorist fighters,

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:55.275
we see young men
with the wind in their hair

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.845
out in the desert
and women going to join them

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.510
to have nuptials out in the sunset.
