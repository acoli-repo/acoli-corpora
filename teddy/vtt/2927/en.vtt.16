This one is from Canada,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.415
and it's meant to create dialogues
within a classroom setting,

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.971
using storytelling,

00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:11.146
because violent extremism
can be very hard to try to explain,

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.869
especially to younger individuals.

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:17.218
So we have a network of former extremists
and survivors of extremism

00:08:17.242 --> 00:08:21.179
that tell their stories through video
and create question-giving to classrooms,

00:08:21.203 --> 00:08:23.506
to start a conversation about the topic.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.062
These two examples show Christianne,

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:27.237
who lost her son,

00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:29.754
who radicalized and died
fighting for ISIS,

00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:31.445
and Daniel is a former neo-Nazi
