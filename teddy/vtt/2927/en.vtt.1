WEBVTT

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.829
to get a better understanding
of why people were joining.

00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:32.410
So a colleague enrolled me,

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:35.362
and my last name sounds
a little bit too Jewish.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.425
So Erin got turned into Iréna,

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.649
and Saltman got turned into Sós,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.594
which means "salty" in Hungarian.

00:00:43.618 --> 00:00:45.928
And in Hungarian,
your last name goes first,

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:50.366
so my James Bond name
turned into "Salty Irena,"

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.873
which is not something
I would have naturally chosen for myself.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.187
But going to this camp,

00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:00.734
I was further shocked to realize
that it was actually really fun.
