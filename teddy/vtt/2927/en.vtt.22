So I would say
that if you are in the audience

00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:05.377
and you happen to be a graphic designer,

00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.583
a poet, a marketing expert,

00:11:07.607 --> 00:11:09.516
somebody that works in PR,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.893
a comedian --

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:13.068
you might not think
that this is your sector,

00:11:13.092 --> 00:11:15.831
but actually, the skills
that you have right now

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.858
might be exactly what is needed

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:20.191
to help challenge extremism effectively.

00:11:20.215 --> 00:11:21.366
Thank you.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.603
(Applause)
