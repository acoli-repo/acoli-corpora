00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:03.325
It provides tools and scale and rapidity

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.857
that doesn't exist elsewhere.

00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:07.342
And with ISIS, all of a sudden,

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:12.684
this idea of a cloaked, dark figure
of a jihadist changed for us.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.763
All of a sudden,
we were in their kitchens.

00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:16.786
We saw what they were eating for dinner.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.961
They were tweeting.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.143
We had foreign terrorist fighters
tweeting in their own languages.

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:24.119
We had women going out there
talking about their wedding day,

00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:25.890
about the births of their children.

00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:27.811
We had gaming culture, all of a sudden,

00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:31.001
and references
to Grand Theft Auto being made.
