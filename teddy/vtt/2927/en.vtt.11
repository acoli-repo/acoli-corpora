00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:31.001
and references
to Grand Theft Auto being made.

00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.932
So all of a sudden, they were homey.

00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:35.107
They became human.

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:37.345
And the problem
is that trying to counter it,

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.679
lots of governments
and social media companies

00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:40.854
just tried to censor.

00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:42.869
How do we get rid of terrorist content?

00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:44.548
And it became a cat-and-mouse game

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.776
where we would see accounts taken down
and they'd just come back up,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.913
and an arrogance around somebody
having a 25th account

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:54.031
and material that was
disseminated everywhere.

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:56.076
But we also saw a dangerous trend --

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.108
violent extremists know the rules
and regulations of social media, too.
