Jewish people or immigrants,

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:34.244
and then the discourse would become
very hate-based very quickly.

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:37.653
So it led me into my work now,

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:40.058
where we pose the question,

00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:43.122
"Why do people join
violent extremist movements,

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:46.177
and how do we effectively
counter these processes?"

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.864
In the aftermath of horrible
atrocities and attacks

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:53.251
in places like Belgium, France,
but all over the world,

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.108
sometimes it's easier for us to think,

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.077
"Well, these must be sociopaths,

00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:00.165
these must be naturally
violent individuals.
