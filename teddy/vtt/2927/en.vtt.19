We can use these marketing tools
to be very specific,

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:32.772
so that we know
when somebody's viewing, watching

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:34.285
and engaging with that content,

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:36.939
it's not just the average person,
it's not me or you --

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:40.070
it's a very specific audience
that we are looking to engage with.

00:09:40.704 --> 00:09:44.403
Even more downstream, we developed
a pilot program called "One to One,"

00:09:44.427 --> 00:09:45.976
where we took former extremists

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.864
and we had them reach out directly
to a group of labeled neofascists

00:09:50.888 --> 00:09:52.512
as well as Islamist extremists,

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:56.351
and put direct messages through Facebook
Messenger into their inbox, saying,

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:58.661
"Hey, I see where you're going.
I've been there.

00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.227
If you want to talk, I'm here."
