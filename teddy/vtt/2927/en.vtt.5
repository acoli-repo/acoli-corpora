00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:30.574
that there are quite a number
of different things

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.949
that affect somebody's
process of radicalization,

00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:36.743
and we categorize these
into push and pull factors.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.180
And these are pretty much similar
for Far Right, neo-Nazi groups

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:43.108
all the way to Islamist extremist
and terrorist groups.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.521
And push factors are basically
what makes you vulnerable

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.403

00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:51.633
to joining a violent extremist group.

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.783
And these can be
a lot of different things,

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:57.720
but roughly, a sense of alienation,
a sense of isolation,

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.895
questioning your own identity,

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.745
but also feeling that your in-group
is under attack,
