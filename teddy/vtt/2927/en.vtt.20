00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.227
If you want to talk, I'm here."

00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:03.505
Now, we kind of expected death threats
from this sort of interaction.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:07.949
It's a little alarming to have
a former neo-Nazi say, "Hey, how are you?"

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:10.180
But actually, we found
that around 60 percent

00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:12.758
of the people reached out to responded,

00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:16.867
and of that, around another 60 percent
had sustained engagement,

00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.947
meaning that they were
having conversations

00:10:18.971 --> 00:10:22.187
with the hardest people to reach
about what they were going through,

00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:23.362
planting seeds of doubt

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:26.378
and giving them alternatives
for talking about these subjects,

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:27.752
and that's really important.

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.284
So what we're trying to do
