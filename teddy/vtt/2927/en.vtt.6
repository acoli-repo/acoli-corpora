00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.745
but also feeling that your in-group
is under attack,

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.562
and your in group might be based
on a nationality or an ethnicity

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.912
or a religion,

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:11.547
and feeling that larger powers around you
are doing nothing to help.

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:15.496
Now, push factors alone
do not make you a violent extremist,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.950
because if that were the fact,

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:20.244
those same factors would go
towards a group like the Roma population,

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:23.049
and they're not
a violently mobilized group.

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:25.360
So we have to look at the pull factors.

00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:28.694
What are these violent
extremist organizations offering

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:30.663
that other groups are not offering?
