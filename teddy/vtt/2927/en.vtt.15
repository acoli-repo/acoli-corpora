00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:31.628
and exposure to ideas

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:33.419
to make them resilient.

00:07:33.443 --> 00:07:34.959

00:07:34.983 --> 00:07:38.808
if somebody is starting to question
and agree with certain things online,

00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:42.681
and it's also very different
if somebody already has a swastika tattoo

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.753
and is very much embedded within a group.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:46.211

and talk you through

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.046
what some of the new ways
of engaging with people are becoming.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.787
One is "Extreme Dialogue,"

00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.891
and it's an educational program
that we helped develop.

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:02.296
