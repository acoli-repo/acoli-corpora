00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:31.407
it's trying to build a state.

00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.371
And what that means is all of a sudden,

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:35.395
your recruitment model is much more broad.

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.468

are now women.

And so, this really changes

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:56.069
who we're trying to counter
this process with.

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.330
Now, not all doom and gloom.

00:06:58.354 --> 00:07:01.314
So the rest I'd like to talk about
some of the positive things
