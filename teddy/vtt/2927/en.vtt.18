00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:01.386
And that's when we combine
large groups of civil society voices

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.941
with creatives, techies,
app developers, artists, comedians,

00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:08.648
and we can create really specified content

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:12.966
and actually, online, disseminate it
to very strategic audiences.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.793
So one example would be
creating a satirical video

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:18.316
which makes fun of Islamophobia,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.276

to 15- to 20-year-olds online

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.547
that have an interest in white power music

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:26.970
and live specifically in Manchester.

00:09:26.994 --> 00:09:30.025
We can use these marketing tools
to be very specific,
