00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:01.980
in your house of worship, somewhere,
there's some black young guy there.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.438
And you're nice. You say hi.

00:12:03.438 --> 00:12:09.784
I'm saying go deeper, closer, further,
and build the kinds of relationships,

00:12:09.784 --> 00:12:15.064
the kinds of friendships that actually
cause you to see the holistic person

00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:18.552
and to really go against the stereotypes.

00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:20.145
I know some of you are out there,

00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.436

I know because I have some white
friends in particular that will say,

00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.408
"You have no idea how awkward I am.

00:12:25.408 --> 00:12:28.140
Like, I don't think this
is going to work for me.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.876
I'm sure I'm going to blow this."

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:35.835
Okay, maybe, but this thing is not 
about perfection. It's about connection.
