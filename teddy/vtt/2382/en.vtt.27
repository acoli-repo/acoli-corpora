00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:31.148
So go away from your comfort
into a bigger, brighter thing,

00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:36.140
because that is how we will stop
another Ferguson from happening.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.370
That's how we create a community

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.382
where everybody, especially
young black men, can thrive.

00:13:41.382 --> 00:13:44.305
So this last thing is going to be harder,

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:47.173
and I know it, but I'm just going
to put it out there anyway.

00:13:47.173 --> 00:13:52.412
When we see something, we have to have
the courage to say something,

00:13:52.412 --> 00:13:56.206
even to the people we love.

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:59.847
You know, it's holidays
and it's going to be a time

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.279
when we're sitting around the table
and having a good time.
