WEBVTT

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:31.309
expand your social
and professional circles.

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:33.139
Who's in your circle?

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.595
Who's missing?

00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:39.592
How many authentic relationships

00:11:39.592 --> 00:11:46.062
do you have with young black people,
folks, men, women?

00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:49.814
Or any other major difference
from who you are

00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:53.150
and how you roll, so to speak?

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.229
Because, you know what?
Just look around your periphery.

00:11:56.229 --> 00:11:58.532
There may be somebody at work,
in your classroom,

00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:01.980
in your house of worship, somewhere,
there's some black young guy there.
