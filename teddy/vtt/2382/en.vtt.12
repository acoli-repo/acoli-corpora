00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.562
we are more quickly able to associate

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:05.640
that picture with a positive word,
that white person with a positive word,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.305
than we are when we are 
trying to associate

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:11.520
positive with a black face,
and vice versa.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.900
When we see a black face,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.948
it is easier for us to connect
black with negative

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:22.075
than it is white with negative.

00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:27.339
Seventy percent of white people
taking that test prefer white.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.753
Fifty percent of black people
taking that test prefer white.
