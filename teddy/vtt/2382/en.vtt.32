00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:08.390
with seeing both the color

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.024
and the character of young black men,

00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:15.857
but that you, and you expect them,

00:16:15.857 --> 00:16:20.371
to be part of the forces of change
in this society

00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:26.939
that will stand against injustice
and is willing, above all other things,

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:35.725
to make a society where young black men 
can be seen for all of who they are.
