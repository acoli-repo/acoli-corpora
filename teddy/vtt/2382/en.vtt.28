when we're sitting around the table
and having a good time.

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.478
Many of us, anyways, will be in holidays,

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:10.402
and you've got to listen to
the conversations around the table.

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:17.094
You start to say things like,
"Grandma's a bigot."

00:14:17.094 --> 00:14:18.924
(Laughter)

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.863
"Uncle Joe is racist."

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:26.482
And you know, we love Grandma
and we love Uncle Joe. We do.

00:14:26.482 --> 00:14:31.937
We know they're good people,
but what they're saying is wrong.
