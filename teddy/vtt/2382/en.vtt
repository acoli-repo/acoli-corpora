00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:03.167
I was on a long road trip this summer,

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:06.245
and I was having
a wonderful time listening

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:10.992
to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's
"The Warmth of Other Suns."

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:20.761
It documents six million black folks
fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.238
looking for a respite
from all the brutality

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:27.999
and trying to get to a better
opportunity up North,

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.407
and it was filled with stories
of the resilience and the brilliance
