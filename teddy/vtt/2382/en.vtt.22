You know, biases are the stories
we make up about people

00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:07.888
before we know who they actually are.

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:10.620
But how are we going to know who they are

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.427
when we've been told to avoid
and be afraid of them?

00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:19.480
So I'm going to tell you
to walk toward your discomfort.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.517
And I'm not asking you
to take any crazy risks.

00:11:22.517 --> 00:11:27.417
I'm saying, just do an inventory,

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:31.309
expand your social
and professional circles.
