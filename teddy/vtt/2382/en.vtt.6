There are three things that I want
to offer us today to think about

00:03:01.454 --> 00:03:06.562
as ways to stop Ferguson
from happening again;

00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:08.861
three things that I think will help us

00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.336
reform our images of young black men;

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:16.652
three things that I'm hoping
will not only protect them

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:20.848
but will open the world
so that they can thrive.

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.619
Can you imagine that?

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:27.700
Can you imagine our country
embracing young black men,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.045
seeing them as part of our future,
giving them that kind of openness,
