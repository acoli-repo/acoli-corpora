00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.962
This violence, this brutality
against black men

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:35.824
has been going on for centuries.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:40.385
I mean, it's the same story.
It's just different names.

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:43.908
It could have been Amadou Diallo.

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:46.823
It could have been Sean Bell.

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:50.213
It could have been Oscar Grant.

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:53.065
It could have been Trayvon Martin.

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:57.044
This violence, this brutality,

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.863
is really something that's part
of our national psyche.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.632
It's part of our collective history.
