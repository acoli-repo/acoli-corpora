00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.939

I don't know why exactly I think that,
but that's what I think.

00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:15.925
So she was saying, "Oh, you
were going, 'Yay, a black guy'?"

00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:18.989
She said, "I was going,
'Ooh, a black guy.'"

different reaction.

00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:28.463
And she said, "I feel so bad.
I'm a diversity consultant.

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:31.281
I did the black guy thing.
I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"
