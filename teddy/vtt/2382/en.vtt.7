that kind of grace we give
to people we love?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:41.054
How much better would our lives be?
How much better would our country be?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.967
Let me just start with number one.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.906
We gotta get out of denial.

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:51.359
Stop trying to be good people.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.503

You know, I do a lot of diversity work,

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.382
and people will come up to me

00:03:58.382 --> 00:04:02.067
They're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady,
we're so glad you're here" --
