00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:31.460
It was all good, and then it started
getting turbulent and bumpy,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.877
and I was like,

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:35.295
"I hope she can drive."

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:36.634
(Laughter)

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:37.826
I know. Right.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.068
But it's not even like
I knew that was a bias

00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:43.558
until I was coming back on the other leg
and there's always a guy driving

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:45.307
and it's often turbulent and bumpy,

00:04:45.307 --> 00:04:48.133
and I've never questioned
the confidence of the male driver.

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.089
The pilot is good.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.585
Now, here's the problem.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:05:00.096
If you ask me explicitly,
I would say, "Female pilot: awesome."
