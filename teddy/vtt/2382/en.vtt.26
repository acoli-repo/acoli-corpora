You know, it's the empathy
and the compassion

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:04.903
that comes out of having relationships
with people who are different from you.

00:13:04.903 --> 00:13:07.898
Something really powerful
and beautiful happens:

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:10.414
you start to realize that they are you,

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:16.196
that they are part of you,
that they are you in your family,

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:19.194
and then we cease to be bystanders

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:23.179
and we become actors,
we become advocates,

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.677
and we become allies.

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:31.148
So go away from your comfort
into a bigger, brighter thing,
