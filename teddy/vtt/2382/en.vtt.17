00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:35.371
who have changed our lives
and made them better.

00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.890
So here's the thing.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.441
The other possibility in science,

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:43.365
and it's only temporarily changing
our automatic assumptions,

00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:45.870
but one thing we know

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.662
is that if you take a white person
who is odious that you know,

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:53.672
and stick it up next to a person of color,

00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:56.131
a black person, who is fabulous,

00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.637
then that sometimes actually
causes us to disassociate too.

00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:04.851
So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.
