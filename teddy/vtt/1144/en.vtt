00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.269
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:03.483
I don't sleep that much,

00:00:03.507 --> 00:00:06.230
and I've come to this thing
about, like, not sleeping much

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:07.560
as being a great virtue,

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.241
after years of kind of battling it

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:11.271
as being a terrible
detriment or something.

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:14.236
And now I really like sort of sitting up.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.415
You know, but for years,
I've been sitting up,

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.736
and I think my creativity
is greatly motivated

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.411
by this kind of insomnia.

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:27.710
I lie awake. I think thoughts.
I walk aimlessly sometimes.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.567
I used to walk more at night.

00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:33.682
I walk during the day, and I follow
people who I think look interesting.
