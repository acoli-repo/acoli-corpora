00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
especially if they're valuable books.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because you could just buy another one,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But do things that you love.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --
