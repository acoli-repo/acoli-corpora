make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
we would have achieved something.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
sort of these auto-page-turning things.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you can go and get the proper intonation.
