00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
about 300,000 now -- doing very well.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
so that it's a cost point that we could afford?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
we would have achieved something.
