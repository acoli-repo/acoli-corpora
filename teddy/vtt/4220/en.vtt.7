There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
still very book-like -- on your laptop.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.
