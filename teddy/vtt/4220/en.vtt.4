the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If you wanted to put all of the published works online

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
