00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We've scanned about 200,000 books.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So all in all, that's going very well.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
into the out-of-print world.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and have the classic thing that you have,
