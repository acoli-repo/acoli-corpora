00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and have the classic thing that you have,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that are starting to participate in this program,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to try out this model of where does a library stop

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and where does the bookstore take over.
