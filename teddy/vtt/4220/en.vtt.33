00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and being able to compare what happened in the past?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and have them up on the Net.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.
