It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,
