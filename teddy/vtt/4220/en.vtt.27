00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
so we've found that there are niches in the music world

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And we've been starting to make these available by going

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and offering shelf space on the Net.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
If you give something to a charity or to the public,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
except on the Net, where you can go broke.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you can lose your guitars or your house.
