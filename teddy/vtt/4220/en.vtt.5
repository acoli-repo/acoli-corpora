Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.
