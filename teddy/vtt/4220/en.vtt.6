00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That's pretty neat.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Then the question is, what do you get?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You know, is it worth trying to get there?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Do you actually want it online?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.
