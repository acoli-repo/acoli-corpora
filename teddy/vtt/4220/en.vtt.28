If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you can lose your guitars or your house.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This doesn't make any sense.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
as long as nobody made any money. You could --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.
