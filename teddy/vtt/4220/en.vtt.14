00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So here's one of the beta units and you can --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and it turns out that 200 dots per inch

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.
