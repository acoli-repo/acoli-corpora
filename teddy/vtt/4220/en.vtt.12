00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There are some newer technologies for delivering

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.
