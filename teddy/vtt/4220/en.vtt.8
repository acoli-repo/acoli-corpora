00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I like the physical book.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
put them on the Net, and then download,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
print them and bind them, and end up with books again.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And it turns out to not be very hard.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.
