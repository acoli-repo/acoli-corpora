00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:02.890
I think I'll start out
and just talk a little bit

00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:04.405
about what exactly autism is.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:07.064
Autism is a very big continuum

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:10.262
that goes from very severe --
the child remains nonverbal --

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:12.976
all the way up to brilliant
scientists and engineers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.977
And I actually feel at home here,

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.547
because there's a lot
of autism genetics here.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.603
(Laughter)

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:19.785
You wouldn't have any --

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.778
(Applause)

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.838
It's a continuum of traits.

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.519
When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
which is just mild autism?
