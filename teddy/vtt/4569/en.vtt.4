00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.441
to manage conflict
and solve social issues.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.189
RW: I'm just curious:

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.403
Do we have any conflict
that needs managing

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:07.443
or social issues to resolve?

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.709
IBI: Remember --
you're on a date with my idea,

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:11.921
not me.

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.430
Jane McGonigal: This is the face
of someone who, against all odds,

00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:18.216
is on the verge of an epic win.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.441
RW: An epic win?

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:23.069
JM: An epic win is an outcome
so extraordinarily positive,

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:26.470
you didn't even know it was possible
until you achieved it.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.768
You're not making the face.
