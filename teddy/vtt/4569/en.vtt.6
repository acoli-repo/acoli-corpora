Reggie Watts: If we're going
to do something,

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.872
we've got to just make a decision.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.441
Because without a decision
we're left powerless.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:05.737
Without power,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.742
we have nothing to supply

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.078
the chain of those who are truly curious

00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:13.360
to solve all of our current conditions.

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:16.283
RW: And, "If you choose not to decide,

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:18.434
you still have made a choice" -- Rush.

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:20.332
JM: Yes!

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:21.867
This is the face we need to see

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.985
on millions of problem solvers worldwide,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.038
as we try to tackle the challenges
of the next century.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:30.473
RW: So, are we going Dutch?
