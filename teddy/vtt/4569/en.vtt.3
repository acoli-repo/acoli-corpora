RW: Well, I'm a little
nearsighted, but yeah.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:32.752
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:34.723
your brain has no access to this world.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:37.980
In fact, even the sensory information
that your eyes are receiving,

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.161
your ears are receiving,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.859
is completely meaningless
because it could mean anything.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.602
That tree could be a large object far away

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:45.940
or a small object up close,

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:47.907
and your brain has no way of knowing.

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.141
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot
but it was just a German shepherd.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.302
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos
are, together with chimpanzees,

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:55.797
your closest living relatives.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.365
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.441
to manage conflict
and solve social issues.
