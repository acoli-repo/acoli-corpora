RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic
and defiant act you can do.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.743
People in these areas --
they're exposed to crappy food.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.035
I want people to know
that growing your own food

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.607
is like printing your own money.

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.218
RW: You're like a food superhero!

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.565
RF: Food is the problem
and food is the solution.

Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.537
My job is to put every word
possible into the dictionary.

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.901
RW: I love words, too --

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.536
just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.930
What if you love a word
that you've just made up,

00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:26.890
like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:28.897
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.228
RW: Well, I'm a little
nearsighted, but yeah.
