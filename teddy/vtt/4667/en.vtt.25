00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:31.948
we are in denial of
the true causes of poverty.

00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:33.821
And in the meantime,

00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:35.116
we all suffer,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.275
because social scientists have shown
with detailed statistical data

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:44.868
that there are more people with both
mental and physical health problems

00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:49.091
in societies with higher levels
of economic inequality.

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:54.534
So social inequality is apparently bad
for not only those with least resources

00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:55.746
but for all of us,

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.256
because living in a society
with high inequality

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.459
means living in a society
with low social trust and high anxiety.
