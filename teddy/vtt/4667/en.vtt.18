00:08:56.104 --> 00:09:01.030
I guess life has really given me
this chance to look around, to stop,

00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:03.429
because all these years
I've been working nonstop,

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:04.916
had no time to pause.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.763
And now I have stopped,

00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:11.431
and I've been given an opportunity
to look at everything and to decide

00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:13.019
what it is that I want

00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:14.855
and what it is that I don't want.

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:18.586
All this time, sewing, sewing,
some kind of exhaustion."

00:09:19.783 --> 00:09:23.527
So Žanete is made redundant
after 23 years.

00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:25.897
But she's not thinking about protesting.

00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.795
She's not talking about the 99 percent
against the one percent.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.748
She is analyzing herself.
