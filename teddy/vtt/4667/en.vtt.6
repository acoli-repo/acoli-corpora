00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.472
the 99 percent against the one percent.

00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:03.808
You know the story.

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:06.891
Yet when I arrived in Riga,

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.283
there were no echoes of the Occupy here.

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:12.147
Latvians were just putting up with it.

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.076
They "swallowed the toad,"
as the local saying goes.

00:03:18.202 --> 00:03:19.964
For my doctoral research,

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.497
I wanted to study how the state-citizen
relationship was changing in Latvia

00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.188
in the post-Soviet era,

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:28.531
and I had chosen the unemployment office

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:30.003
as my research site.
