If a person is afraid to lose
their money, to lose their job,

00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:34.260
they start getting more stressed,
more unsettled, more fearful.

00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:35.875
That's what they get."

00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:38.397
As I ask him to explain,

00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:42.733
he compares his thoughts poetically
to wild horses running in all directions,

00:10:42.757 --> 00:10:45.771
and he says, "You need to be
a shepherd of your thoughts.

00:10:46.757 --> 00:10:49.035
To get things in order
in the material world,

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:51.081
you need to be a shepherd
of your thoughts,

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:54.488
because it's through your thoughts
that everything else gets orderly."

00:10:54.512 --> 00:10:56.756
"Lately," he says,
"I have clearly understood

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.289
that the world around me,
what happens to me,

00:10:59.313 --> 00:11:02.889
people that enter in my life ...
it all depends directly on myself."
