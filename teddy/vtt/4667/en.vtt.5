00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:39.218
Prominent economists were fighting
in the columns of "The New York Times"

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.859
about this curious extreme
Latvian experiment

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:45.074
of this austerity regime,

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.971
and they were watching on in disbelief

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:49.393
how the Latvian society
was putting up with it.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.460
I was studying in London at the time,

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:55.218
and I remember the Occupy movement there

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:57.740
and how it was spreading
from city to city,

00:02:57.764 --> 00:02:59.893
from Madrid to New York to London,

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.472
the 99 percent against the one percent.
