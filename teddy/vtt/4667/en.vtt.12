to be managed in one's own body

00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:06.939

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:17.095
have become increasingly common
across the world.

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.876
They are part of the rise

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.693

00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:29.835
half human, half beast.

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:34.788
It has this upper part of a human
and the lower part of a horse.
