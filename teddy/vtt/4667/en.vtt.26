00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.459
means living in a society
with low social trust and high anxiety.

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:04.107
So there we are.

00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.017
We're all reading self-help books,

00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:07.749
we try to hack our habits,

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:09.611
we try to rewire our brains,

00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:11.340
we meditate.

00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:13.732
And it helps, of course, in a way.

00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:17.100
Self-help books help us feel more upbeat.

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:22.058
Meditation can help us feel
more connected to others spiritually.

00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:24.588
What I think we need

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:29.641
is as much awareness of what connects
us to one another socially,

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:32.576
because social inequality hurts us all.
