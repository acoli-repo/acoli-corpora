00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.274
the crisis is still ongoing,

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.412
the Latvian economy is contracting,

00:04:34.436 --> 00:04:36.516
hardly anyone is hiring,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.029
and there we are,

00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:41.076
in this small, brightly lit classroom,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.358
a group of 15 people,

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:47.988
working on lists of our personal strengths
and weaknesses, our inner demons,

00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:51.103
that we are told are preventing us
from being more successful

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:52.691
in the labor market.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:56.614
As the largest local bank
is being bailed out

00:04:56.638 --> 00:05:01.244
and the costs of this bailout are shifted
onto the shoulders of the population,
