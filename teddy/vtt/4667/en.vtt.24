00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:03.293
So the language, the language
of individual responsibility,

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:05.699
has become a form of collective denial.

00:12:06.342 --> 00:12:09.448
As long as we have social policies
that treat unemployment

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:11.243
as individual failure

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:15.187
but we don't have enough funding
for programs that give people real skills

00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:16.788
or create workplaces,

00:12:16.812 --> 00:12:19.993
we are blind of the
policymakers' responsibility.

00:12:20.017 --> 00:12:23.864
As long as we stigmatize the poor
as somehow passive or lazy

00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:26.484
but don't give people real means
to get out of poverty

00:12:26.508 --> 00:12:28.030
other than emigrating,

00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:31.948
we are in denial of
the true causes of poverty.
