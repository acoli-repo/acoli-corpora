I notice I'm standing outside the Riga
Municipality Social Welfare Department.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.490
So it appears that the author
of this graffiti, whoever it is,

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:14.115
is asking this question to people
coming to apply for social assistance.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.303
That winter,

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:22.719
I had been doing research on the aftermath
of the financial crisis in Latvia.

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:27.826
When the Global Financial Crisis
erupted in 2008, Latvia got hit hard

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.971
as a small, open economy.
