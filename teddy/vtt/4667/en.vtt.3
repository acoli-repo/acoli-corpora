00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.615
To balance the books,

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:35.412
the Latvian government chose
a strategy of internal devaluation.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:40.011
Now, in essence, that meant drastically
reducing public budget spending,

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.890
so, slashing public sector workers' wages,

00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:44.395
shrinking civil service,

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:47.463
cutting unemployment benefits
and other social assistance,

00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:49.001
raising taxes.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.028
My mother had been working
as a history teacher her whole life.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:59.032
The austerity for her meant
seeing her salary cut by 30 percent

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.539
all of a sudden.
