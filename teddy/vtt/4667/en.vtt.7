00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:30.003
as my research site.

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:34.013
And as I arrived there
in that autumn of 2011,

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:37.833
I realized, "I am actually
witnessing firsthand

00:03:37.857 --> 00:03:40.404
how the effects of crises are playing out,

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:44.474
and how those worst affected by it,
people who have lost their jobs,

00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:46.051
are reacting to it."

00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:52.591
So I started interviewing people
I met at the unemployment office.

00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:58.668
They were all registered as job seekers
and hoping for some help from the state.

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:03.181
Yet, as I was soon discovering,
this help was of a particular kind.
