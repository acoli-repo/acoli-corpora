00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.579
It was a cold, sunny March day.

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:07.875
I was walking along the street in Riga.

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:12.042
I remember the winter was slowly
coming to an end.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.813
There was still some snow
around here and there,

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:17.827
but the pavement
was already clear and dry.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.396
If you've lived in Riga,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.795
you will know that feeling of relief
that the first signs of spring bring,

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.525
and you no longer have to trudge
through that slushy mix

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:29.228
of snow and mud on the streets.
