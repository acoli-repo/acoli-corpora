00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.262
So there I am, enjoying my stroll,

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:38.675
as I suddenly notice a stencil
on the pavement in front of me,

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:39.884
a graffiti:

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:44.956
white letters painted
on these dark grey bricks.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.449
It says,

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:51.192
"Where is your responsibility?"

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.138
The question stopped me in my tracks.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:59.789
As I'm standing there
considering its meaning,

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:04.964
I notice I'm standing outside the Riga
Municipality Social Welfare Department.
