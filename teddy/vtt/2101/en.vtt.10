00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:02.786
was they seemed a lot more adept

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.750
at getting a handle on our language

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:09.914
than we were on getting
a handle on theirs.

00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:13.533
I work with a lot of musicians
from around the world,

00:05:13.557 --> 00:05:16.301
and often we don't have
any common language at all,

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:19.988
but we sit down behind our instruments,

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:23.325
and suddenly there's a way
for us to connect and emote.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.141
So I started cold-calling,
and eventually got through

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:28.274
to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:30.173
and she invited me down.
