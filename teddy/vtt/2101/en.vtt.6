These are big brains,
highly social animals,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.562
and I thought, well, if we give
them choice and control,

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:06.634
if they can hit a symbol
on this keyboard --

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:09.305
and by the way, it was interfaced
by fiber optic cables

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.175
from Hewlett-Packard
with an Apple II computer.

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.062
This seems prehistoric now,

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:16.259
but this was where
we were with technology.

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:19.082
So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.256
they heard a computer-generated whistle,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.061
and they got an object or activity.

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:24.479
Now here's a little video.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:27.297
This is Delphi and Pan,
and you're going to see Delphi

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:31.446
hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated
whistle -- (Whistle) --
