Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox

00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:33.488
with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,

00:10:33.512 --> 00:10:37.179
and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.251
two of our Bornean orangutans.

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:44.379
During the day, they have
a beautiful, large outdoor habitat,

00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:47.071
and at night, they come into this habitat,

00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:48.787
into their night quarters,

00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:50.716
where they can have a climate-controlled

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.708
and secure environment to sleep in.

00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:57.103
We participate in the Apps
for Apes program

00:10:57.127 --> 00:11:00.536
Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads
