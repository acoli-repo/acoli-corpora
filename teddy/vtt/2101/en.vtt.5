They're radically different. They come
from a radically different environment.

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:35.057
In fact, we're separated
by 95 million years

00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:37.203
of divergent evolution.

Look at this body.

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:42.793
And in every sense of making a pun here,

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:47.156

touch-screen keyboard.

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.274
What I wanted to do was give
the dolphins choice and control.

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:01.396
These are big brains,
highly social animals,
