00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:31.792
these remarkable sentient beings

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:34.378
that we share the planet with access?

00:08:34.402 --> 00:08:38.390
And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
got excited about that,

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.511
called her friend Steve Woodruff,

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:43.599
and we began hustling all sorts of people

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:46.662
whose work related or was inspiring,

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:48.831
which led us to Diana,

00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:51.818
and led us to Neil.

00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:54.033
Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter.
PG: Thank you.

00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:57.642
(Applause)

00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.314
NG: So Peter approached me.

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.934
I lost it when I saw that clip.
