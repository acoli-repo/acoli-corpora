00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:00.201
but share a common sensory environment.

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.425
We're beginning to explore what it means

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:03.989
to communicate with something

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:06.351
that isn't just another person.

00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:09.077
Well, you can see what's coming next.

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.005
All kinds of possible sentient beings

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:14.029
may be interconnected through this system,

00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:17.146
and I can't wait to see
these experiments unfold.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.161
What happens after that?

00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:21.891
Well, let's see.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.076
There are machines that need
to talk to machines

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.334
and that we need to talk to,
and so as time goes on,

00:16:28.358 --> 00:16:30.153
we're going to have to learn
