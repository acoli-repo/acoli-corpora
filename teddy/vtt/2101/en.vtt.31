The Internet of Things tell us

00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:35.713
that a lot of computer-enabled
appliances and devices

00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:38.169
are going to become part
of this system too:

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:40.442
appliances that you use around the house,

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:42.361
that you use in your office,

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:44.986
that you carry around with yourself
or in the car.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.353
That's the Internet
of Things that's coming.

00:15:47.377 --> 00:15:50.155
Now, what's important
about what these people are doing

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:52.506
is that they're beginning to learn

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.756
how to communicate with species

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.098
that are not us

00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:00.201
but share a common sensory environment.
