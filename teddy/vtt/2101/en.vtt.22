WEBVTT

00:10:57.127 --> 00:11:00.536
Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.725
to help stimulate and enrich the animals,

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:04.434
and also help raise awareness

00:11:04.458 --> 00:11:06.871
for these critically endangered animals.

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:11.119
And they share 97 percent of our DNA

00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:12.927
and are incredibly intelligent,

00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:16.438
so it's so exciting to think
of all the opportunities

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:19.474
that we have via technology
and the Internet

00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:23.216
to really enrich their lives
and open up their world.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.293
We're really excited about the possibility

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.143
of an interspecies Internet,

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:31.496
and K.J. has
been enjoying the conference very much.
