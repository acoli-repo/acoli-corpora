WEBVTT

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:30.441
which was where I met
Peter, I showed this.

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:32.827
This is a $1 web server,

00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:35.276
and at the time that was radical.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.982
And the possibility of making
a web server for a dollar

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:42.527
grew into what became known
as the Internet of Things,

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:45.779
which is literally an industry
now with tremendous implications

00:09:45.803 --> 00:09:48.256
for health care, energy efficiency.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.673
And we were happy with ourselves.

00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:51.364
And then when Peter showed me that,

00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:53.055
I realized we had missed something,

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:55.082
which is the rest of the planet.

00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:57.583
So we started up this
interspecies Internet project.

00:09:57.607 --> 00:09:59.209
Now we started talking with TED

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:01.948
about how you bring dolphins
and great apes and elephants
