We did this work in my lab
with the dolphins and elephants,

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.226
and it's been recently
shown in the magpie.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.126
Now, it's interesting,
because we've embraced

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.148
this Darwinian view of a continuity
in physical evolution,

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:11.740
this physical continuity.

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:15.023
But we've been much more
reticent, much slower

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:18.959
at recognizing this
continuity in cognition,

00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:21.943
in emotion, in consciousness
in other animals.

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:24.509
Other animals are conscious.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.799
They're emotional. They're aware.

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:30.684
There have been multitudes
of studies with many species
