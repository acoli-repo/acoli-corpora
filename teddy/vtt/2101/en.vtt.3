00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:30.684
There have been multitudes
of studies with many species

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:34.255
over the years that have
given us exquisite evidence

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.126
for thinking and consciousness
in other animals,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.717
other animals that are quite
different than we are in form.

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:43.410
We are not alone.

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:47.540
We are not alone in these abilities.

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:50.905
And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.676
is that, with our growing awareness

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.272
about the consciousness of others

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:57.916
and our relationship with the rest
of the animal world,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.506
that we'll give them
the respect and protection
