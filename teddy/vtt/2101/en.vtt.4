00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.506
that we'll give them
the respect and protection

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.387
that they deserve.

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.935
So that's a wish I'm throwing
out here for everybody,

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.776
and I hope I can really
engage you in this idea.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.419
Now, I want to return to dolphins,

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:11.635
because these are the animals
that I feel like

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.180
I've been working up closely
and personal with

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:15.590
for over 30 years.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.439
And these are real personalities.

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:20.540
They are not persons,
but they're personalities

00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:22.026
in every sense of the word.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.212
And you can't get more
alien than the dolphin.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:27.708
They are very different
from us in body form.

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:31.447
They're radically different. They come
from a radically different environment.
