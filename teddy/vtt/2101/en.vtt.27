WEBVTT

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:30.287
And once again, we've been building
great relationships

00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:32.743
among them just
since we've been rehearsing.

00:13:32.767 --> 00:13:35.529
So at that point, if we can go
back to the other computer,

00:13:35.553 --> 00:13:37.887
we were starting to think
about how you integrate

00:13:37.911 --> 00:13:40.736
the rest of the biomass
of the planet into the Internet,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.343
and we went to the best possible person

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:46.006
I can think of, which is Vint Cerf,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.052
who is one of the founders
who gave us the Internet. Vint?

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:51.420
VC: Thank you, Neil.

00:13:51.444 --> 00:13:55.006
(Applause)

00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:00.086
A long time ago in a galaxy
— oops, wrong script.
