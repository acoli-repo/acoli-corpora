Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.918
through a window at a dolphin
spinning playfully,

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:09.076
but what you're actually looking through

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.637
is a two-way mirror at a dolphin

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:14.827
looking at itself spinning playfully.

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.950
This is a dolphin that is self-aware.

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:18.572
This dolphin has self-awareness.

00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:20.652
It's a young dolphin named Bayley.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:23.700
I've been very interested
in understanding the nature

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.123
of the intelligence of dolphins
for the past 30 years.

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:30.307
How do we explore
intelligence in this animal
