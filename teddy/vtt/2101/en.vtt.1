How do we explore
intelligence in this animal

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:31.797
that's so different from us?

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.857
And what I've used is a very
simple research tool,

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.437
a mirror, and we've gained
great information,

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:40.894
reflections of these animal minds.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:44.494
Dolphins aren't the only animals,
the only non-human animals,

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:46.634
to show mirror self-recognition.

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:49.626
We used to think this
was a uniquely human ability,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.927
but we learned that the great
apes, our closest relatives,

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.512
also show this ability.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:56.211
Then we showed it in dolphins,

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.223
and then later in elephants.

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:01.057
We did this work in my lab
with the dolphins and elephants,
