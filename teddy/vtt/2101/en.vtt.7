00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:31.446
hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated
whistle -- (Whistle) --

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.159
and gets a ball, so they can
actually ask for things they want.

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:39.298
What was remarkable is,
they explored this keyboard

00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:42.645
on their own. There was no
intervention on our part.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.289
They explored the keyboard.
They played around with it.

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:46.848
They figured out how it worked.

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:49.063
And they started to quickly
imitate the sounds

00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:51.812
they were hearing on the keyboard.

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:53.769
They imitated on their own.

00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:55.940
Beyond that, though, they started learning

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.700
associations
between the symbols, the sounds

00:03:58.724 --> 00:04:01.025
and the objects.
