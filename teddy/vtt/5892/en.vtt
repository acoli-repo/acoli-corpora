Hey, WorkLife, it's Adam Grant, season
four is right around the corner,

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:07.454
but today I wanted to share a special
conversation in our Taken

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:10.788
for Granted series. I'm talking
to Daniel Kahneman.

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:13.663
Danny won a Nobel Prize in economics.

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:16.663
He's been named one of the most
influential economists in the world,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.829
but he's not on board with that.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:25.871
Oh, my God, no. The behavioral economist.
I'm not any kind of economist.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.163
Danny is one of the great psychologists
of our time, actually, of all time.
