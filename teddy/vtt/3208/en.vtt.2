00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.599
into the "Terra do fim do mundo" --

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.551
the land at the end of the earth,

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.464
as it was known by the first
Portuguese explorers.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.648
In 2001, at the age of 22,

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:13.564
I took a job as head of housekeeping
at Vundumtiki Camp

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:15.688
in the Okavango Delta ...

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:20.316
a patchwork mosaic of channels,
floodplains, lagoons

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.608
and thousands upon thousands
of islands to explore.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.949
Home to the largest remaining
population of elephants on the planet.

00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:33.229
Rhinos are airlifted in C130s
to find sanctuary in this wilderness.
