00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.170
to establish one of the largest systems
of protected areas in the world

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.596
to preserve the
Okavango-Zambezi water tower

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.795
we have been exploring.

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.766
Downstream, this represents
water security for millions of people

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.107
and more than half of the elephants
remaining on this planet.

00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:15.238
There is no doubt this is the biggest
conservation opportunity in Africa

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:16.508
in decades.

00:08:16.532 --> 00:08:17.942
Over the next 10 to 15 years,

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:20.239
we need to make
an unprecedented investment

00:08:20.263 --> 00:08:22.769
in the preservation
of wilderness around the world.

00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:24.498
To me,

00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:29.181
preserving wilderness is far more
than simply protecting ecosystems

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:32.196
that clean the water we drink
and create the air we breathe.
