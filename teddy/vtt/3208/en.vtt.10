00:04:57.704 --> 00:05:01.013
we had launched
the Okavango megatransect ...

00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:02.698
in seven dugout canoes;

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:06.799
1,500 miles, 121 days later,

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:09.333
all of the poling, paddling
and intensive research

00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:13.119
got us across the entire river basin
to Lake Xau in the Kalahari Desert,

00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:16.447
480 kilometers past the Okavango Delta.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.644
My entire world became the water:

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:23.429
every ripple, eddy,
lily pad and current ...

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:26.146
any sign of danger,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.044
every sign of life.

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.904
Now imagine millions of sweat bees
choking the air around you,
