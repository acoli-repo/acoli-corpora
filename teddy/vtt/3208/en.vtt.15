00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:30.977
We now have 57 top scientists

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:34.978
rediscovering what we call
the Okavango-Zambezi water tower --

00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:41.647
this vast, post-war wilderness
with undocumented source lakes,

00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:46.186
unnamed waterfalls in what is Africa's
largest remaining Miombo woodland.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.242
We've now discovered
24 new species to science

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:52.532
and hundreds of species
not known to be there.

00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:56.346
This year, we start the process,
with the Angolan government,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.170
to establish one of the largest systems
of protected areas in the world
