You're living on rice and beans,

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:04.959
bathing in a bucket of cold water

00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.814
and paddling a marathon
six to eight hours every single day.

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:09.806
After 121 days of this,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.157
I'd forgotten the PIN numbers
to my bank accounts

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:13.631
and logins for social media --

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:15.685
a complete systems reboot.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.554
You ask me now if I miss it,

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.871
and I will tell you I am still there.

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.310
Now why do we need to save
places we hardly ever go?

00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:26.402
Why do we need to save places

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:28.525
where you have to risk
your life to be there?

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:32.793
Now, I'm not a religious
or particularly spiritual person,
