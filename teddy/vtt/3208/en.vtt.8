00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:01.191
Ten thousand years ago,
we were as we are today:

00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:05.030
a modern, dreaming intelligence
unlike anything seen before.

00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:07.503
Living in the wilderness
is what taught us to speak,

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:11.109
to seek technologies
like fire and stone, bow and arrow,

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:12.965
medicine and poison,

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.158
to domesticate plants and animals

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:18.437
and rely on each other
and all living things around us.

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.836
We are these last wildernesses --

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.188
every one of us.

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:24.868
Over 80 percent
of our planet's land surface

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:28.041
is now experiencing
measurable human impact:

00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:29.414
habitat destruction

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:33.282
and illegal wildlife trade are decimating
global wildlife populations.
