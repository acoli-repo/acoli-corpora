00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:32.793
Now, I'm not a religious
or particularly spiritual person,

00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:33.987
but in the wild,

00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.663
I believe I've experienced
the birthplace of religion.

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:41.424
Standing in front of an elephant
far away from anywhere

00:06:41.448 --> 00:06:44.464
is the closest I will ever get to God.

00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:47.603
Moses, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus,

00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:49.911
the Hindu teachers, prophets and mystics,

00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:51.443
all went into the wilderness --

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.340
up into the mountains, into the desert,

00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:55.594
to sit quietly and listen
for those secrets

00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:58.131
that were to guide
their societies for millennia.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.665
I go into the Okavango on my mokoro.
