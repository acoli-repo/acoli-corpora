00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:00.602
all seven billion of us --

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:04.057
must never forget
we are a biological species

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.130
forever bound to this
particular biological world.

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.421
Like the waves connected to the ocean,

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.002
we cannot exist apart from it --

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:15.814
a constant flow of atoms and energy
between individuals and species

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:17.485
around the world in a day

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.601
and out into the cosmos.

00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:24.634
Our fates are forever connected
to the millions of species

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:28.769
we rely on directly
and indirectly every day.
