00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:01.151
because we left no safe space
for millions of species

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.258
to sustainably coexist.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:09.977
Now, since 2010, I have poled myself
eight times across the Okavango Delta

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.740
to conduct detailed scientific surveys

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:16.134
along a 200-mile,
18-day research transect.

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:17.363
Now, why am I doing this?

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.054
Why am I risking my life each year?

00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:21.299
I'm doing this because
we need this information

00:03:21.323 --> 00:03:23.323
to benchmark this near-pristine wilderness

00:03:23.347 --> 00:03:25.309
before upstream development happens.

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:30.884
These are the Wayeyi river bushmen,
the people of the Okavango Delta.
