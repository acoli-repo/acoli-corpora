Four years ago,

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.870
it was declared that 50 percent
of all wildlife around the world

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:38.235
had disappeared in just 40 years.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.536
This is a mass drowning
of 15,000 wildebeests

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.922
that I witnessed
in the Maasai Mara two years ago.

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:48.279
This is definitely our fault.

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:53.583
By 2020, global wildlife populations
are projected to have fallen

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.797
by a staggering two-thirds.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.012
We are the sixth extinction

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:01.151
because we left no safe space
for millions of species
