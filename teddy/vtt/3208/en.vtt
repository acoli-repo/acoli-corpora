00:00:00.687 --> 00:00:01.842
Visible from space,

00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.493
the Okavango Delta

00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:08.231
is Africa's largest remaining
intact wetland wilderness.

00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:14.096
This shining delta in landlocked Botswana
is the jewel of the Kalahari,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.549
more valuable than diamonds
to the world's largest diamond producer

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:20.962
and celebrated in 2014

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.471
as our planet's 1000th
UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.400
Now, what you see here
are the two major tributaries,

00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:29.441
the Cuito and the Cubango,

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.591
disappearing up north
into the little-known Angolan highlands.
