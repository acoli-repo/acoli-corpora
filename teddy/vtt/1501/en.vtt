On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:09.785
that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:14.292
that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:18.339
making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.604
This one is more than 400 years old.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.068
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:30.364
and it was the imperfections that people cherished.
