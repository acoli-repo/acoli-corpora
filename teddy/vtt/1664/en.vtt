00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to read a few strips.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
These are, most of these are

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
from a monthly page I do

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in and architecture and design magazine

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
called Metropolis.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the first story is called

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
"The Faulty Switch."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Another beautifully designed new building

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's fine during the day

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.
