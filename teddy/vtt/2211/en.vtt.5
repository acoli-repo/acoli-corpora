00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:32.511
which are proteins that span the membrane.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:33.894
And here's how it works.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:38.400
This rat trap represents an ion channel.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:42.410
It has a pore that passes
potassium ions and calcium ions.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:46.847
It has a little molecular gate
that can be open, or it can be closed.

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:52.400
And its status is set by this elastic band
which represents that protein filament.

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:57.117
Now, imagine that this arm
represents one stereocilium

00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.223
and this arm represents
the adjacent, shorter one
