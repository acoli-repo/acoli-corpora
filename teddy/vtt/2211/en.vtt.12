00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.221
and an individual may then need
an electronic hearing aid

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.958
to supplant the damaged biological one.

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:11.621
This active process also enhances
our frequency selectivity.

00:06:12.022 --> 00:06:15.271
Even an untrained individual
can distinguish two tones

00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:18.088
that differ by only
two-tenths of a percent,

00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:22.405
which is one-thirtieth of the difference
between two piano notes,

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:24.767
and a trained musician can do even better.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.582
This fine discrimination is useful

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:30.136
in our ability to distinguish
different voices
