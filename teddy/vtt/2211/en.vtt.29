00:14:28.908 --> 00:14:31.596
with understanding speech
in a noisy environment

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.037
or over the telephone.

00:14:33.553 --> 00:14:35.729
Many have even worse deficits.

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:38.729
Moreover, these deficits
tend to get worse with time,

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.730
because when human hair cells die,

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:43.625
they're not replaced by cell division.

00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:47.993
But we know that nonmammalian animals
can replace their cells,

00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:51.423
and those creatures' cells are dying
and being replaced throughout life,

00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:53.822
so the animals maintain normal hearing.

00:14:54.587 --> 00:14:56.996
Here's an example
from a little zebra fish.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.645
The cell at the top
will undergo a division

00:14:59.669 --> 00:15:02.229
to produce two new hair cells.
