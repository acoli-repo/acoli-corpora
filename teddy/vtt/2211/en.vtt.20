This same instability also enhances
our frequency selectivity,

00:10:03.764 --> 00:10:06.481
for a given hair cell
tends to oscillate best

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:09.355
at the frequency at which
it normally trembles

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:11.264
when it's not being stimulated.

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:18.598
So, this apparatus not only
gives us our remarkably acute hearing,

00:10:18.622 --> 00:10:21.409
but also gives us
the very sharp tuning.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:27.689
I want to offer you a short demonstration

00:10:27.713 --> 00:10:29.432
of something related to this.

00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:32.513
I'll ask the people who
are running the sound system
