was a little cluster of bristles.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.674
With modern electron microscopy,
we can see much better

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.512
the nature of the special feature
that gives the hair cell its name.

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.160
That's the hair bundle.

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:16.528
It's this cluster of 20 to several
hundred fine cylindrical rods

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:19.435
that stand upright
at the top end of the cell.

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:25.552
And this apparatus is what is responsible
for your hearing me right this instant.

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:29.386
Now, I must say that I am
somewhat in love with these cells.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.402
I've spent 45 years in their company --
