00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:32.513
I'll ask the people who
are running the sound system

00:10:32.537 --> 00:10:36.087
to turn up its sensitivity
at one specific frequency.

00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:39.731
So just as a hair cell is tuned
to one frequency,

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:44.416
the amplifier will now enhance
a particular frequency in my voice.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.474
Notice how specific tones emerge
more clearly from the background.

00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:52.817
This is exactly what hair cells do.

00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:57.449
Each hair cell amplifies and reports
one specific frequency

00:10:57.473 --> 00:10:59.360
and ignores all the others.

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:03.463
And the whole set of hair cells,
as a group, can then report to the brain
