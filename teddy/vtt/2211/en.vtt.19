00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:30.485
it just sat there, except
when it was stimulated.

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:32.729
But in fact, it's an active machine.

00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:36.494
It's constantly using internal energy
to do mechanical work

00:09:36.518 --> 00:09:38.257
and enhance our hearing.

00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:41.612
So even at rest,
in the absence of any input,

00:09:41.636 --> 00:09:43.873
an active hair bundle
is constantly trembling.

00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:46.121
It's constantly twitching back and forth.

00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:48.564
But when even a weak sound
is applied to it,

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.725
it latches on to that sound
and begins to move very neatly

00:09:51.749 --> 00:09:53.342
in a one-to-one way with it,

00:09:53.366 --> 00:09:57.821
and by so doing, it amplifies the signal
about a thousand times.

00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:03.740
This same instability also enhances
our frequency selectivity,
