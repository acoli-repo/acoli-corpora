How does your ear do that?

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.787
And the answer to that is:

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.312
through the cells that are the real hero
of this presentation --

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.533
the ear's sensory receptors,

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:41.642
which are called "hair cells."

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:45.652
Now, these hair cells
are unfortunately named,

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:48.525
because they have nothing at all
to do with the kind of hair

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.226
of which I have less and less.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.197
These cells were originally named that
by early microscopists,

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.621
who noticed that emanating
from one end of the cell

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:00.860
was a little cluster of bristles.
