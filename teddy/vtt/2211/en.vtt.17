00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:34.951
successive musical tones are represented
a few tens of hair cells apart

00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:36.827
along the cochlear surface.

00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:39.319
Now, this separation of frequencies

00:08:39.343 --> 00:08:43.139
is really key in our ability
to identify different sounds,

00:08:43.163 --> 00:08:44.774
because very musical instrument,

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:46.015
every voice,

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.113
emits a distinct constellation of tones.

00:08:49.523 --> 00:08:52.225
The cochlea separates those frequencies,

00:08:52.249 --> 00:08:56.031
and the 16,000 hair cells
then report to the brain

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:57.865
how much of each frequency is present.

00:08:58.213 --> 00:09:01.220
The brain can then compare
all the nerve signals
