00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:30.136
in our ability to distinguish
different voices

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.775
and to understand the nuances of speech.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:35.682
And, again, if the active
process deteriorates,

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:38.566
it becomes harder to carry out
verbal communication.

00:06:39.423 --> 00:06:43.800
Finally, the active process is valuable
in setting the very broad range

00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:47.250
of sound intensities
that our ears can tolerate,

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.073
from the very faintest sound
that you can hear, such as a dropped pen,

00:06:51.097 --> 00:06:53.312
to the loudest sound that you can stand --

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:55.703
say, a jackhammer or a jet plane.

00:06:55.727 --> 00:07:00.810
The amplitude of sounds
spans a range of one millionfold,
