00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:30.094
We can hear sounds at frequencies
as great as 20,000 cycles per second,

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:32.679
and some animals have ever faster ears.

00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:37.505
The ears of bats and whales, for example,
can respond to their sonar pulses

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.881
at 150,000 cycles a second.

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:47.488
But this speed doesn't entirely explain
why the ear performs so well.

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:51.812
And it turns out that our hearing
benefits from an amplifier,

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:54.099
something called the "active process."

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:57.933
The active process enhances our hearing

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:01.994
and makes possible all the remarkable
features that I've already mentioned.
