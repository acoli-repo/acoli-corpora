00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.330
alternately opens and closes the channel,

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:34.547
and each opening admits millions
and millions of ions into the cell.

00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:37.624
Those ions constitute
an electrical current

00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.129
that excites the cell.

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.881
The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber,

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:44.100
and then propagates into the brain.

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:47.092
Notice that the intensity of the sound

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:49.837
is represented by
the magnitude of this response.

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.744
A louder sound pushes
the hair bundle farther,

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:54.251
opens the channel longer,

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:55.780
lets more ions in

00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:58.380
and gives rise to a bigger response.
