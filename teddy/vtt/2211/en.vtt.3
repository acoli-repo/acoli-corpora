I've spent 45 years in their company --

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:33.444
(Laughter)

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.093
and part of the reason
is that they're really beautiful.

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:38.051
There's an aesthetic component to it.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:40.164
Here, for example, are the cells

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:43.417
with which an ordinary chicken
conducts its hearing.

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.610
These are the cells
that a bat uses for its sonar.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:51.597
We use these large hair cells from a frog
for many of our experiments.

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.716
Hair cells are found all the way down
to the most primitive of fishes,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.144
and those of reptiles often have
this really beautiful,

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.036
almost crystalline, order.
