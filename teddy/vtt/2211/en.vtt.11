00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.861
Why do we need this amplification?

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:34.999
The amplification,
in ancient times, was useful

00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:39.929
because it was valuable for us to hear
the tiger before the tiger could hear us.

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:44.945
And these days, it's essential
as a distant early warning system.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.832
It's valuable to be able
to hear fire alarms

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:53.772
or contemporary dangerous such as speeding
fire engines or police cars or the like.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:59.906
When the amplification fails,
our hearing's sensitivity plummets,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.221
and an individual may then need
an electronic hearing aid
