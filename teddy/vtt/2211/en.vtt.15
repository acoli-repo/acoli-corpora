00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:32.271
It's an organ about
the size of a chickpea.

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:35.579
It's embedded in the bone
on either side of the skull.

00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:39.037
We also learn that an optical prism

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:43.182
can separate white light
into its constituent frequencies,

00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:45.644
which we see as distinct colors.

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:47.800
In an analogous way,

00:07:47.824 --> 00:07:51.265
the cochlea acts as sort of
an acoustic prism

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.666
that splits apart complex sounds
into their component frequencies.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.213
So when a piano is sounded,

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.473
different notes blend
together into a chord.
