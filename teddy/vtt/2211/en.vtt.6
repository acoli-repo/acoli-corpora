00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.223
and this arm represents
the adjacent, shorter one

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.546
with the elastic band between them.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.656
When sound energy impinges
upon the hair bundle,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.839
it pushes it in the direction
towards its taller edge.

00:03:08.863 --> 00:03:11.661
The sliding of the stereocilia
puts tension in the link

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.752
until the channels open
and ions rush into the cell.

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:17.962
When the hair bundle is pushed
in the opposite direction,

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.396
the channels close.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.847
And, most importantly,

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:23.168
a back-and-forth motion
of the hair bundle,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:27.785
as ensues during the application
of acoustic waves,

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.330
alternately opens and closes the channel,
