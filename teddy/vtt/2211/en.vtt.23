00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:30.978
Why don't our ears beam out sounds?

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:33.219
And the answer is that they do.

00:11:33.577 --> 00:11:37.996
In a suitably quiet environment,
70 percent of normal people

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.483
will have one or more sounds
coming out of their ears.

00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:43.358
(Laughter)

00:11:43.382 --> 00:11:45.396
I'll give you an example of this.

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:50.995
You will hear two emissions
at high frequencies

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.793
coming from a normal human ear.

00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:55.716
You may also be able to discern
background noise,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.102
like the microphone's hiss,

00:11:57.126 --> 00:12:00.926
the gurgling of a stomach,
the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes.
