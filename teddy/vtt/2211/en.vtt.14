00:06:55.727 --> 00:07:00.810
The amplitude of sounds
spans a range of one millionfold,

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:03.503
which is more than is encompassed
by any other sense

00:07:03.527 --> 00:07:06.327
or by any man-made device
of which I'm aware.

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.385
And again, if this system deteriorates,

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:12.151
an affected individual
may have a hard time

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:14.023
hearing the very faintest sounds

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:17.226
or tolerating the very loudest ones.

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:20.813
Now, to understand
how the hair cell does its thing,

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:24.315
one has to situate it within
its environment within the ear.

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:27.144
We learn in school
that the organ of hearing

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:29.920
is the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea.

00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:32.271
It's an organ about
the size of a chickpea.
