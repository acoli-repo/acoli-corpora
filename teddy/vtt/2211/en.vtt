Can you hear me OK?

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.569
Audience: Yes.

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:08.594
Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can,
it's really amazing,

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:12.768
because my voice is changing
the air pressure where you sit

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.073
by just a few billionths
of the atmospheric level,

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:17.632
yet we take it for granted

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:21.031
that your ears can capture
that infinitesimal signal

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:25.555
and use it to signal to the brain
the full range of auditory experiences:

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.449
the human voice, music, the natural world.
