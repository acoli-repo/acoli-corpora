00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.036
almost crystalline, order.

00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:03.409
But above and beyond its beauty,

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:06.171
the hair bundle is an antenna.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:11.914
It's a machine for converting
sound vibrations into electrical responses

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:13.762
that the brain can then interpret.

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:18.023
At the top of each hair bundle,
as you can see in this image,

00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:21.461
there's a fine filament
connecting each of the little hairs,

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.161
the stereocilia.

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.016
It's here marked with
a little red triangle.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.799
And this filament has at its base
a couple of ion channels,

00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:32.511
which are proteins that span the membrane.
