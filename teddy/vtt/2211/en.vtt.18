00:08:58.213 --> 00:09:01.220
The brain can then compare
all the nerve signals

00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:04.417
and decide what particular
tone is being heard.

00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:09.812
But this doesn't explain everything
that I want to explain.

00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:10.989
Where's the magic?

00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:14.907
I told you already about the great things
that the hair cell can do.

00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:17.870
How does it carry out the active process

00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:21.563
and do all the remarkable features
that I mentioned at the outset?

00:09:21.587 --> 00:09:23.586
The answer is instability.

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.180
We used to think that the hair bundle
was a passive object,

00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:30.485
it just sat there, except
when it was stimulated.
