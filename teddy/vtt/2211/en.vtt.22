00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:03.463
And the whole set of hair cells,
as a group, can then report to the brain

00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:06.544
exactly what frequencies
are present in a given sound,

00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:09.295
and the brain can determine
what melody is being heard

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:11.798
or what speech is being intended.

00:11:13.775 --> 00:11:17.136
Now, an amplifier such as
the public address system

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.051
can also cause problems.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:21.313
If the amplification is turned up too far,

00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:23.816
it goes unstable and begins to howl

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.146
or emit sounds.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.353
And one wonders why the active process
doesn't do the same thing.

00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:30.978
Why don't our ears beam out sounds?
