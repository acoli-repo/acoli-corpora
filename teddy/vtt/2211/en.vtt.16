00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.473
different notes blend
together into a chord.

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:03.347
The cochlea undoes that process.

00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.939
It separates them and represents
each at a different position.

00:08:07.282 --> 00:08:09.604
In this picture, you can see
where three notes --

00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:12.443
middle C and the two
extreme notes on a piano --

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:14.213
are represented in the cochlea.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.450
The lowest frequencies go all the way up
to the top of the cochlea.

00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:21.305
The highest frequencies,
down to 20,000 Hz,

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:23.868
go all the way to the bottom
of the cochlea,

00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:27.726
and every other frequency
is represented somewhere in between.

00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:29.977
And, as this diagram shows,
