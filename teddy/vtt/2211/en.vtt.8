00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:04.711
Now, this mode of operation
has the advantage of great speed.

00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:07.229
Some of our senses, such as vision,

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:10.018
use chemical reactions that take time.

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:11.452
And as a consequence of that,

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:15.806
if I show you a series of pictures
at intervals of 20 or 30 per second,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.217
you get the sense of a continuous image.

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:20.784
Because it doesn't use reactions,

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:25.171
the hair cell is fully 1,000 times
faster than our other senses.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:30.094
We can hear sounds at frequencies
as great as 20,000 cycles per second,
