happens to everyone --

00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:06.302
all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:08.241
It's everywhere.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.761
And my second message is that everyone thinks

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:12.879
domestic violence happens to women,

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.147
that it's a women's issue.

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:17.366
Not exactly.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:21.478
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:27.396
happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:29.565
in other words, in families,

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:33.430
the last place we would want or expect to find violence,
