He did this especially at the beginning

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.384
by idolizing me.

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:12.670
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.354
that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.384
that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.

00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:19.915

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.844
in a way that no one else ever had.
