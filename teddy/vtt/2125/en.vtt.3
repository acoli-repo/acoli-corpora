00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.513
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.819
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.181
an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.473
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:43.745
including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:47.541
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.330
and we have three kids together.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.559
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.039
(Laughter)

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.758
So my first message for you is that domestic violence

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:02.126
happens to everyone --
