Conor first physically attacked me

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.419
five days before our wedding.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.611

00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.851
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,

and I got frustrated,

00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:16.752

00:08:19.903 --> 00:08:23.723
and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:25.547
and he used the chokehold

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:29.973
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.

00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:35.291
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,
