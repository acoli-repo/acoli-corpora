00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:31.803
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:36.316
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:38.788
I had moved to New York City for my first job

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.084
as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.324
I had my first apartment,

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:47.524
my first little green American Express card,

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.552
and I had a very big secret.

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:54.251
My secret was that I had this gun

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:57.689
loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.252
by the man who I thought was my soulmate,
