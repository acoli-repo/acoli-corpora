00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:35.291
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,

00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.766
and I put on my mother's wedding dress,

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.083
and I married him.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.364
Despite what had happened,

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.883
I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,

00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:49.964
because I loved him, and he loved me so much.

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:53.336
And he was very, very sorry.

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:56.509
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:58.706
and by becoming a family with me.

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.427
It was an isolated incident,
