It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.389
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:09.284
is kill her.

00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:11.825
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders

00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:15.893
happen after the victim has ended the relationship,

00:11:15.893 --> 00:11:17.786
after she's gotten out,

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:21.037
because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:24.128
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,

00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:27.080
even after the abuser remarries;

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.235
denial of financial resources;

00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:31.624
and manipulation of the family court system
