00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:33.046
Instead, I was a very strong woman

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:35.298
in love with a deeply troubled man,

00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:37.355
and I was the only person on Earth

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:40.795
who could help Conor face his demons.

00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:44.506
The other question everybody asks is,

00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:46.923
why doesn't she just leave?

00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:50.874
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.

00:10:50.874 --> 00:10:55.586
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,

00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:58.677
because we victims know something you usually don't:

00:10:58.677 --> 00:11:03.070
It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.
