WEBVTT

00:04:58.737 --> 00:05:01.550
and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.121
meant so much to him.

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.265
If you had told me

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:11.629
that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.012
would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:18.062
how short my skirts were,

00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:19.992
where I lived, what jobs I took,

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:23.356
who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.304
I would have laughed at you,

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:28.352
because there was not a hint of violence or control

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:31.836
or anger in Conor at the beginning.
