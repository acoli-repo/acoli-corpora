00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.135
He told me two things.

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:34.937
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:39.292
and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:42.952
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.240
was that he was smart and funny

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.640
and he looked like a farm boy.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.987
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:51.672
and this wheat-blond hair,

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.959
and he seemed so sweet.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.743
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:04.317
was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
