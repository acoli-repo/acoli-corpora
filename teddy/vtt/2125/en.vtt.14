00:06:56.193 --> 00:07:00.559
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.191
that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:09.171
physical, financial and psychological trap.

00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.491
The next step in the domestic violence pattern

00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:15.773
is to introduce the threat of violence

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:17.972
and see how she reacts.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:20.681
And here's where those guns come in.

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.599
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.337
that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --

00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:28.753
he bought three guns.

00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:32.193
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.
