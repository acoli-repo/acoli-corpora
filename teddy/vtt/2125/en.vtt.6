00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:03.251
and over 500 women and girls this age

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.822
are killed every year by abusive partners,

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:11.455
boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:14.515
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:19.100
about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.165
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:27.128
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:29.267
and he started chatting me up.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.135
He told me two things.
