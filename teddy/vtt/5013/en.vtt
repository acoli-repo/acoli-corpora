00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.010
"Whoâ€™s there?"

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.220
Whispered in the dark,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.350
this question begins a tale of conspiracy,
deception and moral ambiguity.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.158
And in a play where everyone 
has something to hide,

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:20.648
its answer is far from simple.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.438
Written by William Shakespeare 
between 1599 and 1601,

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:28.268
"Hamlet" depicts its titular character 
haunted by the past,

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:30.868
but immobilized by the future.
