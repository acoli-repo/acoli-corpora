Stephanie White: I'm going to let her 
introduce herself to everybody.

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:04.460
Can you tell everybody your name?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.550
Einstein: Einstein.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.300
SW: This is Einstein. 
Can you tell everyone "hi"?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.572
E: Hello.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.679
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.470
E: Hi, sweetheart.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.750
SW: Much better.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.110
Well, Einstein is very honored 
to be here at TED 2006,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.000
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.460
In fact, she's very excited.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.240
E: Woo.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.000
SW: Yeah.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Since we've arrived, 
there's been a constant buzz

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.770
about all the exciting speakers here 
for the conference.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.640
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers
about Tom O'Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday.
