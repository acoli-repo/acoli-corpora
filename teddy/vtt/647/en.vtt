00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.642
I want to tell you a love story.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.524
But it doesn't have a happy ending.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.029
Once upon a time,
I was a stubborn five-year-old

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:14.053
who decided to become a marine biologist.

00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:18.990
Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives
and one PhD later,

00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:22.180
I'm still completely
enamored with the ocean.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.387
I spent a decade working
with fishing communities

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.593
in the Caribbean,

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:29.012
counting fish, interviewing fishermen,

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:32.551
redesigning fishing gear
and developing policy.
