WEBVTT

00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:02.115
we have launched a new initiative
with NATO and other security policy makers

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:07.505
to explore with them what they can do
to protect health system institutions

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.244
during deployments.

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:10.808
We want them to see

00:12:10.832 --> 00:12:15.532
that protecting health systems
and other critical social institutions

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:17.999
is an integral part of their mission.

00:12:18.023 --> 00:12:21.160
It's not just about avoiding
collateral damage;

00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:22.989
it's about winning the peace.

00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:28.308
But the most important partner
we need to engage is you,

00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:31.764
the American public,
and indeed, the world public.
