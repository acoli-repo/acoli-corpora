00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:30.468
But one interesting thing about it was,

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:32.976
this was sort of an unusual
question for them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.309
They were kind of like,
"Oh, if you work in war,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.582
doesn't that mean
you work on refugee camps,

00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:40.038
and you work on documenting
mass atrocities?" --

00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:42.662
which is, by the way, very,
very, very important.

00:04:43.477 --> 00:04:48.631
So it took me a while to explain
why I was so passionate about this issue,

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.346
until about six years ago.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.435
That's when this landmark study

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:56.568
that looked at and described
the public health consequences of war

00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:57.934
was published.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.895
They came to an incredible,
provocative conclusion.
