00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.956
We, as the global health
community policy experts,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.525
our first job is to become experts
in how to monitor

00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:09.996
the strengths and vulnerabilities
of health systems

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.587
in threatened situations.

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.621
And that's when we see doctors fleeing,

00:11:14.645 --> 00:11:16.582
when we see health resources drying up,

00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:19.041
when we see institutions crumbling --

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:20.678
that's the emergency.

00:11:20.702 --> 00:11:23.812
That's when we need to sound the alarm
and wave our arms.

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:25.230
OK?

00:11:25.254 --> 00:11:26.405
Not now.

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:30.341
Everyone can see that's an emergency,
they don't need us to tell them that.
