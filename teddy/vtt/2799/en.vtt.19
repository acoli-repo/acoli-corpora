00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:30.664
in identifying, training and promoting
Afghani health sector leaders.

00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:35.902
These health sector leaders
have pulled off an incredible feat

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.298
in Afghanistan.

00:09:37.322 --> 00:09:41.269
They have aggressively increased
access to health care

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:43.309
for the majority of the population.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.537
They are rapidly improving
the health status

00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:46.832
of the Afghan population,

00:09:46.856 --> 00:09:48.842
which used to be the worst in the world.

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:52.767
In fact, the Afghan Ministry
of Health does things

00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.487
that I wish we would do in America.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.883
They use things like data to make policy.

00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:58.092
It's incredible.

00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.508
