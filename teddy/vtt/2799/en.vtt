00:00:00.978 --> 00:00:04.080
So have you ever wondered
what it would be like

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.678
to live in a place with no rules?

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:08.984
That sounds pretty cool.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.046
(Laughter)

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.707
You wake up one morning, however,

00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:14.211
and you discover that the reason
there are no rules

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.596
is because there's no government,
and there are no laws.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.687
In fact, all social institutions
have disappeared.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.251
So there's no schools,

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.441
there's no hospitals,

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:26.773
there's no police,

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:28.132
there's no banks,

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.710
there's no athletic clubs,
