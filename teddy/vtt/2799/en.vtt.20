(Laughter)

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.461
The other concern I hear a lot about is:

00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:05.087
"We just can't afford it,
we just don't have the money.

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.466
It's just unsustainable."

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.152
I would submit to you
that the current situation

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.911
and the current system we have

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:15.973
is the most expensive, inefficient system
we could possibly conceive of.

00:10:15.997 --> 00:10:19.375
The current situation
is that when governments like the US --

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:21.463
or, let's say, the collection
of governments

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.361
that make up the European Commission --

00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:26.034
every year, they spend 15 billion dollars

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:30.064
on just humanitarian and emergency
and disaster relief worldwide.
