00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.710
there's no athletic clubs,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.237
there's no utilities.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:36.076
Well, I know a little bit
about what this is like,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.949
because when I was
a medical student in 1999,

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:43.458
I worked in a refugee camp
in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:46.159
When the war was over,

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:49.241
I got permission -- unbelievably --
from my medical school

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.416
to take some time off

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.611
and follow some of the families
that I had befriended in the camp

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.058
back to their village in Kosovo,

00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:02.449
and understand how they navigated
life in this postwar setting.
