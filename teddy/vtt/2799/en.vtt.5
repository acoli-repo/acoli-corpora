00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.106
are very complicated to answer.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.089
Questions about security,
when you don't have any security systems,

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.531
are terrifying.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.318
Is that altercation I had
with the neighbor down the block

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:46.156
going to turn into a violent episode
that will end my life

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.417
or my family's life?

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:50.949
Health concerns
when there is no health system

00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:52.513
are also terrifying.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:56.912
I listened as many families
had to sort through questions like,

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:59.809
"My infant has a fever.
What am I going to do?"
