00:05:56.364 --> 00:06:00.338
is how little impact this insight has had,

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:03.946
in terms of how we think
about human suffering and war.

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.386
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.017
Last year, you may remember,

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:13.166
Ebola hit the West African
country of Liberia.

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:18.029
There was a lot of reporting
about this group, Doctors Without Borders,

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:20.951
sounding the alarm
and calling for aid and assistance.

00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:25.364
But not a lot of that reporting
answered the question:

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:27.940
Why is Doctors Without Borders
even in Liberia?

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:30.640
Doctors Without Borders
is an amazing organization,
