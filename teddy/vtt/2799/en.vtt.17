00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:32.041
I usually tier two concerns,
two arguments.

00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:35.114
The first concern is about corruption,

00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:37.857
and the concern that people
in these settings are corrupt

00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.626
and they are untrustworthy.

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:43.317
And I will admit that I have met
unsavory characters

00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:45.697
working in health sectors
in these situations.

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:49.421
But I will tell you that the opposite
is absolutely true

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.475
in every case I have worked on,

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:55.312
from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo,
to Haiti, to Liberia --

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.435
I have met inspiring people,

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.954
who, when the chips were down
for their country,

00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:03.287
they risked everything
to save their health institutions.
