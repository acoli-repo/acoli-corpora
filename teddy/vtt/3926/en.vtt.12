00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.776
then we'll be working on the problem

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.160
that's probably the most important
issue of this century.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.456
So I never got to be that astronaut
that I always wanted to be,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.096
but this mapping device,
designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.536
It's actually morphed.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.856
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.536
artificially intelligent,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.136
and its ultimate goal
is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.760
and explore oceans beneath
the frozen surface of that body.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.400
And that's pretty amazing.
