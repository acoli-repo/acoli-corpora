00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.720
species that we never knew existed before.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.056
Many of these life-forms
live in unusual ways.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.016
They have no pigment
and no eyes in many cases,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.536
and these animals
are also extremely long-lived.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.016
In fact, animals swimming
in these caves today

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.536
are identical in the fossil record

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.896
that predates the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.656
So imagine that: these are
like little swimming dinosaurs.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.120
What can they teach us
about evolution and survival?
