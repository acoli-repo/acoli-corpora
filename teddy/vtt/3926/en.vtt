I'm an underwater explorer,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.280
more specifically a cave diver.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.816
I wanted to be an astronaut
when I was a little kid,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.440
but growing up in Canada as a young girl,
that wasn't really available to me.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.456
But as it turns out,
we know a lot more about space

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.816
than we do about the underground waterways
coursing through our planet,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.800
the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.096
So I decided to do something
that was even more remarkable.
