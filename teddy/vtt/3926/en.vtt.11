00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.320
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.176
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.096
was that everything we do
on the surface of our earth

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.536
will be returned to us to drink.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.336
Our water planet is not just
rivers, lakes and oceans,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.136
but it's this vast network of groundwater
that knits us all together.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.016
It's a shared resource
from which we all drink.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.336
And when we can understand
our human connections with our groundwater

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.016
and all of our water resources
on this planet,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.776
then we'll be working on the problem
