00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.616
We use a technology called rebreathers.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.856
It's an awful lot like the same technology
that is used for space walks.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.336
This technology enables us to go deeper

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.096
than we could've imagined
even 10 years ago.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.176
We use exotic gases,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.400
and we can make missions
even up to 20 hours long underwater.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.336
I work with biologists.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.896
It turns out that caves
are repositories of amazing life-forms,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.720
species that we never knew existed before.
