I also work with physicists,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.696
and they're interested oftentimes
in global climate change.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.016
They can take rocks within the caves,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.096
and they can slice them
and look at the layers within with rocks,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.056
much like the rings of a tree,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.096
and they can count back in history

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.816
and learn about the climate on our planet
at very different times.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.336
The red that you see in this photograph

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.696
is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.816
So it's been picked up by wind,
blown across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.216
It's rained down in this case
on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
