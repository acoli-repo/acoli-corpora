00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.536
and at other times
crawling beneath the seats,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.096
following a thin guideline,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.856
just waiting for the life support
to provide your very next breath.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.600
Well, that's my workplace.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.736
But what I want to teach you today

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.136
is that our world
is not one big solid rock.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.120
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.816
I can swim through a lot of the pores
in our earth's sponge,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.256
but where I can't,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.296
other life-forms and other materials
can make that journey without me.
