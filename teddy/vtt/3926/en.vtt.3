other life-forms and other materials
can make that journey without me.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.336
And my voice is the one
that's going to teach you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.280
about the inside of Mother Earth.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.616
There was no guidebook available to me

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.696
when I decided to be the first person
to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.136
In 2000, this was the largest
moving object on the planet.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.176
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.136
and we went down there
to explore ice edge ecology

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.800
and search for life-forms beneath the ice.
