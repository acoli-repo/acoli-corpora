It's rained down in this case
on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.856
It soaks in through the ground

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.856
and deposits itself
in the rocks within these caves.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.696
And when we look back in the layers
of these rocks, we can find times

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.496
when the climate
was very, very dry on earth,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.279
and we can go back
many hundreds of thousands of years.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.816
Paleoclimatologists are also interested

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.136
in where the sea level stands were
at other times on earth.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.376
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.456
on the deepest manned dives
ever conducted in the region,
