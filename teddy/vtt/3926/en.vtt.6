What can they teach us
about evolution and survival?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.136
When we look at an animal
like this remipede swimming in the jar,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.016
he has giant fangs with venom.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.296
He can actually attack something
40 times his size and kill it.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.096
If he were the size of a cat,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.720
he'd be the most dangerous
thing on our planet.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.176
And these animals live
in remarkably beautiful places,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.816
and in some cases,
caves like this, that are very young,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.576
yet the animals are ancient.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.880
How did they get there?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.056
I also work with physicists,
