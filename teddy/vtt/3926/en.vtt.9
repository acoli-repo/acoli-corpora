on the deepest manned dives
ever conducted in the region,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.096
and we were looking for places

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.656
where the sea level

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.520
many hundreds of feet
below current levels.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.376
I also get to work with paleontologists

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.880

But my very favorite project of all
was over 15 years ago,
