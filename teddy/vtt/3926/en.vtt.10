00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.256
But my very favorite project of all
was over 15 years ago,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.804
when I was a part of the team
that made the very first

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:08.136
accurate, three-dimensional map
of a subterranean surface.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.536
This device that I'm
driving through the cave

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.016
was actually creating
a three-dimensional model as we drove it.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.096
We also used ultra low frequency radio

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.800
to broadcast back to the surface
our exact position within the cave.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.136
So I swam under houses and businesses
and bowling alleys and golf courses,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.320
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
