but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure.

00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:04.922
The e-liquids can also contain alcohol,

00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.689
sometimes in high levels,

00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:10.552
and inhaling alcohol is known
to have toxic effects on the brain.

00:07:11.957 --> 00:07:16.178
I told you earlier that the e-liquids
contain over 15,000 different flavors.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.614
Here are some examples,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.115
some with very catchy but familiar names
like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops,"

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.585
and others with more exotic names
like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood"

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:29.107
and "Unicorn Puke."

00:07:29.522 --> 00:07:34.010
The e-liquid or the aerosol
can also contain metallic particles
