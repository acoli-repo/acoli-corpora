Now, e-cigarettes were originally created

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.728
to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine

00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:06.669
to help with their cigarette addiction.

come under the FDA's jurisdiction

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:13.163
as a tobacco product.

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:16.570

has not been able to keep up

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.948
with the rapid market growth,

of these devices and e-liquids

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:24.606
are lagging.

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.927
Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.645
to anyone under the age of 18,
