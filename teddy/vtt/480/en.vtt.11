00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:32.820
And then there are modified devices,
which are also called "mods."

00:05:32.844 --> 00:05:35.300
Mods look nothing like a cigarette,

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:38.462
and they come in various shapes and sizes,

00:05:38.486 --> 00:05:41.790
with different kinds of attachments
and user adjustments.

00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:43.904
They're very popular for cloud chasing.

00:05:44.772 --> 00:05:47.157
The most recent entrance
into the marketplace

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.715
are the pod devices,

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:51.126
which contain the e-liquid in a pod.

00:05:51.713 --> 00:05:54.015
These are very popular,
by the way, among teens.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.389
An example of this is the Juul,

00:05:56.413 --> 00:05:59.016
which not only looks like a USB device

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.362
but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge.
