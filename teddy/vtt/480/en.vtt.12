but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge.

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:05.809
Many teens do not even think
that these are e-cigarettes,

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.042
which has led to the use of terms
like "juuling" instead of "vaping."

00:06:10.897 --> 00:06:14.985
Many of these devices are so discreet
and produce so little vapor

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.171
that teens are using them in classrooms

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:20.874
and hiding them in objects
like Sharpie pens, their clothes,

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:22.048
their books.

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:25.473
Now, many teens think
that these devices produce water vapor,

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:27.303
and therefore, they are safe to use.

00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:29.698
But this could not be
further from the truth.
