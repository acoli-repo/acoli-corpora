E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called,

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.866
are flying off the shelves like candy.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.082
This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:14.276
26 billion dollars in sales worldwide.

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.232
Over the next six years,

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:18.255
that volume is expected to double.

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:23.067

about the health impact of vaping,

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.914
and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:30.836
This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes.
