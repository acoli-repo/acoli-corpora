Teens and their parents need to know

00:12:31.287 --> 00:12:34.976
that while e-cigarettes may contain
less toxins than cigarettes,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.763
they're certainly not benign.

00:12:37.773 --> 00:12:41.384
Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals
produced by these devices

00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:44.152
could be changing them in ways
they may not like

00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:47.823
and setting them up for future
unknown toxicities and health problems.

00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:50.922
You know, when I said earlier

00:12:50.946 --> 00:12:54.126
that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit
for the smartphone generation,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.300
I was not kidding.

00:12:55.911 --> 00:12:58.802
We live in a technology-crazed world,

00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:02.950
where the latest device
and technology gets a lot of attention
