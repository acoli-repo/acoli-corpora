What we do know is that youth --

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:07.493
In fact, the FDA commissioner
recently used the term "epidemic"

00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:09.934
to describe e-cigarette use in the US.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.527
While trying to solve one huge
public health problem, cigarette smoking,

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:17.720
we may have created another colossal one.

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:22.359
Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years
around cigarette smoking

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:26.331
led to a cigarette epidemic and many,
many cigarette-related diseases.

00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:29.980
We do not want to repeat
the same mistakes with e-cigarettes.
