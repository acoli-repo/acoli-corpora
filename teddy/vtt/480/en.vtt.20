00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:02.912
So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes
could be leading them down the path

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.416
of other addictions
and other mental health problems.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.611
Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine
also produces epigenetic changes,

00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:14.043
or heritable changes in gene expression,

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:16.667
for example, in the genes
involved in asthma.

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:21.011
So teens who use nicotine may not only
be harming themselves

00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:23.800
but they could be harming
their future generations.

00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.747
You know, the very existence
of e-cigarettes

00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:31.721
could have led to an entire generation
of nicotine-addicted youth.
