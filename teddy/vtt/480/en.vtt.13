00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:32.479
What is produced is not even a vapor,

00:06:32.503 --> 00:06:33.746
it's an aerosol,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.525
and let me tell you, the difference
is quite pronounced.

00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:41.995
Aerosols contain many finely suspended
particles of liquids and gases

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:44.650
that are created
from whatever is in the e-liquid.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.670
So an aerosol could contain
propylene glycol and glycerin,

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:50.382
which are solvents in the e-liquid.

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:53.990
Now, these solvents are known
to be safe for edible use,

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.828
so for use in products that you eat,

00:06:56.852 --> 00:07:01.678
but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure.
