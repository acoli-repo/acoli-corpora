00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:02.769
"It gets easier, right?"

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:06.270
These are the words
I often hear from young parents

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:08.981
who are new to the game
of worrying about their children.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:10.954
I tell them that it doesn't.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:13.152
It gets different,

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:16.285
but there's always something
to worry about as parents.

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.089
I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:21.868
listening to my son breathe

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:24.474
when he was young and had asthma,

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:25.895
and then, when he was a teen,

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.071
until I heard the front door chime open,

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.896
and I knew that he was home safe.
