00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:02.950
where the latest device
and technology gets a lot of attention

00:13:02.974 --> 00:13:06.531
just because it is technology
and because it is the latest thing.

00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:11.064
More and more over the next few years
and for the rest of our lives,

00:13:11.088 --> 00:13:14.122
we are going to see technologies
coming into the marketplace

00:13:14.146 --> 00:13:16.722
that may not raise
any health flags at first,

00:13:16.746 --> 00:13:19.306
simply because they don't look unhealthy

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.275
or they're not a medical device.

00:13:21.938 --> 00:13:23.909
For example, we could see devices

00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:27.308
that may make it easier
to go longer without sleep

00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:28.619
or help us lose weight --

00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:30.194
a personal goal of mine --
