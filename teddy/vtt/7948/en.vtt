00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:05.168
So in my city of Athens, Greece,

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.003
like in many cities around the world,

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.840
a lot of people thought
that climate change

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.426
is something happening far away.

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:19.390
Until ash started falling from the sky

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.270
and temperatures neared
45 degrees Celsius

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:26.981
in the summer of 2021,

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:32.028
and they stayed above 40 degrees
for several days.
