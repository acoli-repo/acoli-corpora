00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, I want to start out with

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
this beautiful picture from my childhood.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I love the science fiction movies.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here it is: "This Island Earth."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Two-and-a-half years in the making.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Laughter)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but Hollywood goes to the chase.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
flying saucers and aliens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.
