00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.899
If you look at the two,
it's almost like two different planets,

00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:05.239
but these places were both built by humans

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:08.903
and in fact, the story is that when
you have a 200-foot block city,

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:10.461
you can have a two-lane city,

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.902
or a two-to-four lane city,

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:15.951
and a 600-foot block city
is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.453
These are the crash statistics.

00:08:17.477 --> 00:08:19.563
When you double the block size --

00:08:19.587 --> 00:08:21.620
this was a study
of 24 California cities --

00:08:21.644 --> 00:08:23.136
when you double the block size,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.786
you almost quadruple
the number of fatal accidents

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.811
on non-highway streets.

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.066
So how many lanes do we have?
