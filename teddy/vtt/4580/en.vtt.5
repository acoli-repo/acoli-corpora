00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.943
because nothing is located
near anything else.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.607
The alternative, of course,
is our most walkable city,

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.161
and I like to say, you know,
this is a Rothko,

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.688
and this is a Seurat.

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.253
It's just a different way --
he was the pointilist --

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:44.110
it's a different way of making places.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:46.943
And even this map of Manhattan
is a bit misleading

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:51.147
because the red color
is uses that are mixed vertically.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.875
So this is the big story
of the New Urbanists --

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.411
to acknowledge
that there are only two ways

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.725
that have been tested by the thousands

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.689
to build communities,
in the world and throughout history.
