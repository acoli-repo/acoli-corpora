00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.313
The other part of this part,

00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:05.828
the useful city part,

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:07.157
is transit,

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.546
and you can have a perfectly
walkable neighborhood without it.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.875
But perfectly walkable cities
require transit,

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.340
because if you don't have access
to the whole city as a pedestrian,

00:07:17.364 --> 00:07:18.525
then you get a car,

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:19.704
and if you get a car,

00:07:19.728 --> 00:07:22.276
the city begins to reshape itself
around your needs,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.982
and the streets get wider
and the parking lots get bigger

00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.883
and you no longer have a walkable city.

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:28.062
So transit is essential.

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:30.487
But every transit experience,
every transit trip,
