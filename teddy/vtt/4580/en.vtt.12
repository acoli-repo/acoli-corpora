00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:01.709
which has been a formative document
of the New Urbanism now

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:03.137
for almost 30 years,

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:07.320
to show that sprawl and the traditional
neighborhood contain the same things.

00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:08.730
It's just how big are they,

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:10.353
how close are they to each other,

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:12.052
how are they interspersed together

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.993
and do you have a street network,
rather than a cul-de-sac

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:17.052
or a collector system of streets?

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.893
So when we look at a downtown area,

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.052
at a place that has a hope
of being walkable,

00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:23.634
and mostly that's our downtowns
in America's cities

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:25.426
and towns and villages,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.515
we look at them and say
we want the proper balance of uses.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.674
So what is missing or underrepresented?
