00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.066
So how many lanes do we have?

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.567
This is where I'm going to tell you
what I tell every audience I meet,

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:37.321
which is to remind you
about induced demand.

00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:41.782
Induced demand applies
both to highways and to city streets.

00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:45.291
And induced demand tells us
that when we widen the streets

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:48.413
to accept the congestion
that we're anticipating,

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:50.774
or the additional trips
that we're anticipating

00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:54.711
in congested systems,
it is principally that congestion

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:56.728
that is constraining demand,

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.514
and so that the widening comes,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.654
and there are all of these latent trips
that are ready to happen.
