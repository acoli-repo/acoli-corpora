00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.999
the planners said, hey, let's move
the housing away from the mills.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.490
And lifespans increased
immediately, dramatically,

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:08.665
and we like to say

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.881
the planners have been trying to repeat
that experience ever since.

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.547
So there's the onset
of what we call Euclidean zoning,

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.646
the separation of the landscape
into large areas of single use.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.147
And typically when I arrive
in a city to do a plan,

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.210
a plan like this already awaits me
on the property that I'm looking at.

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:26.936
And all a plan like this guarantees

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.999
is that you will not have a walkable city,

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.943
because nothing is located
near anything else.
