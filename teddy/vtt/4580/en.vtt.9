00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:30.971
it's wonderful that Westin
in the Ft. Lauderdale area

00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:34.063
has eight soccer fields
and eight baseball diamonds

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:35.946
and 20 tennis courts,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.582
but look at the road
that takes you to that location,

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.552
and would you let your child bike on it?

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.706
And this is why we have
the soccer mom now.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.972
When I was young, I had one soccer field,

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:48.021
one baseball diamond and one tennis court,

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:50.903
but I could walk to it,
because it was in my neighborhood.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:53.778
Then the final part of sprawl
that everyone forgot to count:

00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:56.622
if you're going to separate everything
from everything else

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.180
and reconnect it
only with automotive infrastructure,

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:01.726
then this is what your landscape
begins to look like.
