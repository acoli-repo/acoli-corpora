00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.674
So what is missing or underrepresented?

00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:34.358
And again, in the typical American cities
in which most Americans live,

00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:36.392
it is housing that is lacking.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.606
The jobs-to-housing balance is off.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.813
And you find that when
you bring housing back,

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.903
these other things start to come back too,

00:06:42.927 --> 00:06:45.403
and housing is usually first
among those things.

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:48.531
And, of course, the thing
that shows up last and eventually

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:49.736
is the schools,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.080
because the people have to move in,

00:06:52.104 --> 00:06:56.925
the young pioneers have to move in,
get older, have kids

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.987
and fight, and then the schools
get pretty good eventually.
