00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:31.139
but you guys are smart.

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:35.561
And also I gave that talk
exactly a month ago,

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.652
and you can see it at TED.com.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:40.676
So today I want to talk
about how to do it.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.639
In a lot of time thinking about this,

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:45.763
I've come up with what I call
the general theory of walkability.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.717
A bit of a pretentious term,
it's a little tongue-in-cheek,

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:51.315
but it's something
I've thought about for a long time,

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.723
and I'd like to share
what I think I've figured out.

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:57.586
In the American city,
the typical American city --

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.850
the typical American city
is not Washington, DC,

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:02.182
or New York, or San Francisco;
