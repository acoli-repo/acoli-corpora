00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:00.600
allows you to see
the curvature of the Earth.

00:12:00.624 --> 00:12:01.663
(Laughter)

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.932
This is a subdivision
outside of Washington from the 1960s.

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.277
Look very carefully
at the width of the streets.

00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:09.408
This is a subdivision from the 1980s.

00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:11.067
1960s, 1980s.

00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:13.115
The standards have changed
to such a degree

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.092
that my old neighborhood of South Beach,

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:18.275
when it was time to fix the street
that wasn't draining properly,

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.843
they had to widen it
and take away half our sidewalk,

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:22.606
because the standards were wider.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.085
People go faster on wider streets.

00:12:26.109 --> 00:12:27.266
People know this.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.416
The engineers deny it,
but the citizens know it,
