00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:31.222
and these were the streets
that were designated

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.458
in the new downtown plan

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:36.116
to be four lanes to six lanes wide.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.385
So you had a fundamental disconnect
between the number of lanes

00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:41.651
and the number of cars
that wanted to use them.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:45.590
So it was my job to redesign
every street in the downtown

00:10:45.614 --> 00:10:47.349
from curb face to curb face,

00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:49.375
and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.756
and we're rebuilding it now.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.820
So a typical oversized street to nowhere

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:56.044
is being narrowed, and now
under construction,

00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:57.708
and the project is half done.

00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:59.723
The typical street like this, you know,

00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:03.193
when you do that,
you find room for medians.
