The point being the parking lot
is the principal problem here.

00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:07.686
However, missing teeth, those empty lots
can be issues as well,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.955

because of an outdated zoning code,

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:13.887
then you could have a missing nose
in your neighborhood.

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:15.748
That's what we had in my neighborhood.

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:18.848

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:30.251
Triangular houses
can be interesting to build,
