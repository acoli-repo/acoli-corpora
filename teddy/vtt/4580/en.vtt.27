00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.010
to send me some pictures
of the Portland bike commute.

00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:34.542
He sent me this. I said,
"Was that bike to work day?"

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:36.211
He said, "No, that was Tuesday."

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:41.199
When you do what Portland did and spend
money on bicycle infrastructure --

00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:45.444
New York City has doubled the number
of bikers in it several times now

00:13:45.468 --> 00:13:47.505
by painting these bright green lanes.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:51.095
Even automotive cities
like Long Beach, California:

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:55.198
vast uptick in the number of bikers
based on the infrastructure.

00:13:55.222 --> 00:13:56.913
And of course, what really does it,

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.313
if you know 15th Street
here in Washington, DC --

00:13:59.337 --> 00:14:02.314
please meet Rahm Emanuel's
new bike lanes in Chicago,
