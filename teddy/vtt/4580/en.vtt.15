00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:30.487
But every transit experience,
every transit trip,

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:32.406
begins or ends as a walk,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.228
and so we have to remember to build
walkability around our transit stations.

00:07:36.252 --> 00:07:38.997
Next category, the biggest one,
is the safe walk.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.237
It's what most walkability
experts talk about.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:45.302
It is essential, but alone not enough
to get people to walk.

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:48.469
And there are so many moving parts
that add up to a walkable city.

00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.069
The first is block size.

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:51.440
This is Portland, Oregon,

00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:55.030
famously 200-foot blocks,
famously walkable.

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:56.372
This is Salt Lake City,

00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:58.476
famously 600-foot blocks,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.869
famously unwalkable.

00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.899
If you look at the two,
it's almost like two different planets,
