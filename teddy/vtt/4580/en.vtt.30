00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.412
And then I love this,
because this is objective journalism.

00:15:01.436 --> 00:15:05.515
"Some say the entrance to CityCenter
is not inviting to pedestrians."

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:07.997
When every aspect
of the landscape is swoopy,

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:10.694
is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,

00:15:10.718 --> 00:15:13.035
it says: "This is a vehicular place."

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:18.134
So no one detail, no one speciality,
can be allowed to set the stage.

00:15:18.158 --> 00:15:19.722
And here, you know, this street:

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:23.638
yes, it will drain within a minute
of the hundred-year storm,

00:15:23.662 --> 00:15:26.454
but this poor woman
has to mount the curb every day.

00:15:26.478 --> 00:15:29.424
So then quickly, the comfortable walk
has to do with the fact

00:15:29.448 --> 00:15:34.401
that all animals seek, simultaneously,
prospect and refuge.
