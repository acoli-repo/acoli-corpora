The engineers deny it,
but the citizens know it,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.266
so that in Birmingham, Michigan,
they fight for narrower streets.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.812
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,

00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:40.381
instituted its "Skinny Streets" program
in its residential neighborhood.

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:42.255
We know that skinny streets are safer.

The developer Vince Graham,
in his project I'On,

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.165
which we worked on in South Carolina,

00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:51.104
he goes to conferences and he shows
his amazing 22-foot roads.

00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:53.541
These are two-way roads,
very narrow rights of way,

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.564
and he shows this well-known philosopher,

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:58.458
who said, "Broad is the road
that leads to destruction ...

00:12:58.482 --> 00:13:00.583
narrow is the road that leads to life."
