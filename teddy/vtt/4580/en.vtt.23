00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:30.241
it's in engineering right now --

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:34.056
is turning an all four-lane
system, half one-way

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.657
into an all two-lane system, all two-way,

00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.922
and in so doing, we're adding
70 percent more on-street parking,

00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:42.305
which the merchants love,

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:43.749
and it protects the sidewalk.

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.535
That parking makes the sidewalk safe,

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:49.237
and we're adding a much more
robust bicycle network.

00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:51.842
Then the lanes themselves.
How wide are they?

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:53.076
That's really important.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.266
The standards have changed
such that, as Andrés Duany says,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.384
the typical road
to a subdivision in America

00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:00.600
allows you to see
the curvature of the Earth.
