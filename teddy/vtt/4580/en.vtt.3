00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.949
You need to do all four
of these things simultaneously,

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.003
and that's the structure of my talk today,

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:34.656
to take you through each of those.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.944
The reason to walk
is a story I learned from my mentors,

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.328
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:42.353
the founders of the New Urbanism movement.

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:45.890
And I should say half the slides
and half of my talk today

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.240
I learned from them.

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.043
It's the story of planning,

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.307
the story of the formation
of the planning profession.

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:57.082
When in the 19th century
people were choking

00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:59.599
from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.999
the planners said, hey, let's move
the housing away from the mills.
