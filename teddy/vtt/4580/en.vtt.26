narrow is the road that leads to life."

00:13:00.607 --> 00:13:02.667
(Laughter)

00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:05.060
(Applause)

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.143
This plays very well in the South.

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.064
Now: bicycles.

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:14.411
Bicycles and bicycling
are the current revolution underway

00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:16.118
in only some American cities.

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.783
But where you build it, they come.

00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:21.816
As a planner, I hate to say that,
but the one thing I can say

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.967
is that bicycle population
is a function of bicycle infrastructure.

00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:29.406
I asked my friend Tom Brennan
from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.010
to send me some pictures
of the Portland bike commute.
