or New York, or San Francisco;

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.453
it's Grand Rapids or Cedar

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:08.588
in the typical American city
in which most people own cars

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.933
and the temptation
is to drive them all the time,

00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:14.736
if you're going to get them to walk,
then you have to offer a walk

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.608
that's as good as a drive or better.

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:17.783

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:24.803

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:26.522
the walk has to be comfortable

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:28.315
and the walk has to be interesting.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.949
You need to do all four
of these things simultaneously,
