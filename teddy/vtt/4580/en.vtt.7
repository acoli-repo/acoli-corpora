clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
and it's not walkable,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.043
because so few of the streets connect,

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.950
that those streets that do connect
become overburdened,

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:41.064
and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.939
And I want to thank Alex Maclean,
the aerial photographer,

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:47.018
for many of these beautiful pictures
that I'm showing you today.

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:50.662
So it's fun to break sprawl down
into its constituent parts.

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.263
It's so easy to understand,

00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:55.290
the places where you only live,
the places where you only work,

00:03:56.144 --> 00:03:58.100
the places where you only shop,

00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:01.468
and our super-sized public institutions.
