00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.786
So I'm here to talk to you
about the walkable city.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.169
What is the walkable city?

00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:07.674
Well, for want of a better definition,

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:14.586
it's a city in which the car
is an optional instrument of freedom,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.494
rather than a prosthetic device.

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:19.473
And I'd like to talk about
why we need the walkable city,

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:23.655
and I'd like to talk about
how to do the walkable city.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.019
Most of the talks I give these days
are about why we need it,

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:31.139
but you guys are smart.
