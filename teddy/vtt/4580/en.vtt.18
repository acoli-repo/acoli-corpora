00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.654
and there are all of these latent trips
that are ready to happen.

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:03.067
People move further from work

00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.324
and make other choices
about when they commute,

00:09:05.348 --> 00:09:07.722
and those lanes fill up
very quickly with traffic,

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.247
so we widen the street again,
and they fill up again.

00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:12.497
And we've learned that
in congested systems,

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.936
we cannot satisfy the automobile.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.410
This is from Newsweek Magazine --
hardly an esoteric publication:

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:20.102
"Today's engineers acknowledge

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:23.352
that building new roads
usually makes traffic worse."

00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.939
My response to reading this was,
may I please meet some of these engineers,

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:29.029
because these are not the ones that I --

00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:31.643
there are great exceptions
that I'm working with now --
