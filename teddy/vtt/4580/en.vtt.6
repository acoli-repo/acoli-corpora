00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.689
to build communities,
in the world and throughout history.

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:03.591
One is the traditional neighborhood.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:07.029
You see here several neighborhoods
of Newburyport, Massachusetts,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:11.320
which is defined as being compact
and being diverse --

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:15.486
places to live, work, shop,
recreate, get educated --

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.389
all within walking distance.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:19.549
And it's defined as being walkable.

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:21.107
There are lots of small streets.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.857
Each one is comfortable to walk on.

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:25.395
And we contrast that to the other way,

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.238
an invention that happened
after the Second World War,

00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:29.520
suburban sprawl,

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:34.121
clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
and it's not walkable,
