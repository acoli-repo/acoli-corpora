00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:31.643
there are great exceptions
that I'm working with now --

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:34.973
but these are not the engineers
one typically meets working in a city,

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:38.463
where they say, "Oh, that road
is too crowded, we need to add a lane."

00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:40.647
So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,

00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.128
and they say, "See, I told you
we needed that lane."

00:09:43.152 --> 00:09:46.944
This applies both to highways
and to city streets if they're congested.

00:09:46.968 --> 00:09:50.003
But the amazing thing
about most American cities that I work in,

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.316
the more typical cities,

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.372
is that they have a lot of streets
that are actually oversized

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:56.803
for the congestion
they're currently experiencing.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:58.550
This was the case in Oklahoma City,

00:09:58.574 --> 00:10:01.093
when the mayor came running
to me, very upset,
