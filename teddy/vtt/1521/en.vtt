I don't know if you've noticed,

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.051
but there's been a spate of books

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:05.926
that have come out lately

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:08.068
contemplating or speculating

00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:12.479
on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.350
Do they think, do they feel and, if so, how?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.290
So this afternoon, in my limited time,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.985
I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:22.481
by introducing you to two dogs,

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:27.305
both of whom have taken the command "speak"

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:31.266
quite literally.
