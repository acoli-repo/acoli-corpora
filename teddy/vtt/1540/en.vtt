00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the major inequalities in our world.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
My brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And that's --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
-- that's rather more challenging
