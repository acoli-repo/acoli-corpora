They spray painted cryptic statements 
and symbols all over Lower Manhattan,

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.163
signed with the mysterious moniker SAMO.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:39.288
These humorous, profound, 
and rebellious declarations

00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:42.246
were strategically scattered 
throughout Soho’s art scene.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:44.538
And after revealing himself as the artist,

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:48.329
Basquiat leveraged SAMO’s success 
to enter the scene himself;

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.579
selling postcards, playing clubs with
his avant-garde band,

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.746
and boldly seeking out his heroes.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.371
By 21, he’d turned to painting full time.

00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.454
His process was a sort of 
calculated improvisation.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:00.454
