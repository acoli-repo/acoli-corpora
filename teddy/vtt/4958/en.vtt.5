00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:31.079
Pulling in splintered anatomy, 
reimagined historical scenes,

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.454
and skulls transplanted from 
classical still-lives,

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:38.871
Basquiat repurposed both present day 
experiences and art history

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.371
into an inventive visual language.

00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:45.246
He worked as if inserting himself into 
the legacy of artists he borrowed from,

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:48.829
producing collages that were just as 
much in conversation with art history

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.621
as they were with each other.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:54.204
For instance,
"Toussaint L’Overture versus Savonarola"

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:57.371
and "Undiscovered Genius of the 
Mississippi Delta"

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:01.996
offer two distinct visions of Basquiat’s 
historical and contemporary concerns.
