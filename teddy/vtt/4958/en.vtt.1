WEBVTT

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:31.246
belong to 21 year old 
black Brooklynite Jean-Michel Basquiat –

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.621
one of America’s most 
charismatic painters,

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:36.037
and currently, its highest sold.

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:39.537
Born in 1960 to a Haitian father 
and a Puerto Rican mother,

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:43.912
Basquiat spent his childhood making art 
and mischief in Boerum Hill.

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:45.579
While he never attended art school,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.954
he learned by wandering 
through New York galleries,

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:50.412
and listening to the music 
his father played at home.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:53.204
He drew inspiration from 
unexpected places,

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:57.537
scribbling his own versions of cartoons, 
comic books and biblical scenes

00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:00.287
on scrap paper from his father’s office.
