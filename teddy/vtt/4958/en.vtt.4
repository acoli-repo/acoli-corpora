00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:00.454
Like Beat writers

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.913
who composed their work by shredding 
and reassembling scraps of writing,

00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:07.663
Basquiat used similar cut-up techniques 
to remix his materials.

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:09.246
When he couldn't afford canvases,

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:12.288
he fashioned them out of discarded 
wood he found on the street.

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:16.496
He used oil stick, crayons, 
spray paint and pencil

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.954
and pulled quotes from the menus, 
comic books and textbooks

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.163
he kept open on the studio floor.

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:24.704
He kept these sources open 
on his studio floor,

00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:27.288
often working on multiple 
projects at once.

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:31.079
Pulling in splintered anatomy, 
reimagined historical scenes,
