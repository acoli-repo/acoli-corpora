My job at Twitter

00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:04.253
is to ensure user trust,

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:07.090
protect user rights and keep users safe,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.350
both from each other

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.249
and, at times, from themselves.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.524
Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.394
Back in January 2009,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.725
we saw more than two million new tweets each day

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.489
on the platform.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:30.397
January 2014, more than 500 million.
