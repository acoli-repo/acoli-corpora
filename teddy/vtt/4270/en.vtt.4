00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.088
the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.960
this is a view from above.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.073
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,

00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:10.309
and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.300
So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.944
this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:16.704
of what this thing would have sounded like.

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:18.481
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine

00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.960
— that's why it's computer architecture —

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.287
and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.

00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:26.690
So let's talk about the memory. The memory

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.937
is very like the memory of a computer today,

00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.639
except it was all made out of metal,
