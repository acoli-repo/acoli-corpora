00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:02.317
and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.151
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,

00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:05.723
get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,

00:07:05.723 --> 00:07:09.474
and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,

00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:10.766
who said, "I understand what this does,

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:12.973
and I understand the future of this machine."

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:16.060
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.037
a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:20.640
because of her.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.397
Now, some people call her the first programmer.

00:07:23.397 --> 00:07:26.783
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.

00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:29.694
This is a program written in a particular style.

00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:33.263
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,
