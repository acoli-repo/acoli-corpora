00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.530
So the machine I'm going to talk you about

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.204
is what I call the greatest machine that never was.

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.203
It was a machine that was never built,

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:07.583
and yet, it will be built.

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.575
It was a machine that was designed

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.926
long before anyone thought about computers.

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:14.075
If you know anything about the history of computers,

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.595
you will know that in the '30s and the '40s,

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:19.150
simple computers were created

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.943
that started the computer revolution we have today,

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:23.229
and you would be correct,

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.711
except for you'd have the wrong century.

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.351
The first computer was really designed

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:31.023
in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
