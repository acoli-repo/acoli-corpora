00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:30.612
tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) —

00:08:30.612 --> 00:08:32.508
and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look,

00:08:32.508 --> 00:08:34.984
this thing could even compose music if you

00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:38.532
told it a representation of music numerically."

00:08:38.532 --> 00:08:40.101
So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.

00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.838
When you say she's a programmer, she did do some,

00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:46.975
but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be

00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:49.171
much, much more than this.

00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:51.350
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.803
Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:59.380
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.911
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.
