00:07:58.192 --> 00:08:00.207
or computer or any other computing device

00:08:00.207 --> 00:08:02.288
is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.

00:08:02.288 --> 00:08:06.981
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,

00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.961
it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,

00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.066
and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing

00:08:13.066 --> 00:08:16.388
mathematical functions and symbols

00:08:16.388 --> 00:08:18.635
doesn't mean these things can't represent

00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:21.988
other things in the real world, such as music."

00:08:21.988 --> 00:08:24.722
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,

00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:26.944
"We could compute these amazing functions and print out

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:30.612
tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) —
