00:09:29.765 --> 00:09:32.341
and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.

00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.973
There is in a sense a computing essence.

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.978
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.

00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:38.645
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.868
this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.

00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:43.693
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today

00:09:43.693 --> 00:09:48.525
with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.631
To give you an idea of how slowly,

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.470
it had about 1k of memory.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.388
It used punch cards, which were being fed in,

00:09:57.388 --> 00:10:03.148
and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
