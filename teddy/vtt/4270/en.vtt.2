00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.590
for a soiree — and he invited everybody:

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.022
kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.543
and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:09.583
I really miss that era, you know, where you could

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.931
go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer

00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.044
get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)

00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:16.310
But Babbage, Babbage himself was born

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.044
at the end of the 18th century,

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.088
and was a fairly famous mathematician.

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:23.231
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.743
and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:28.598
He's less well known than either of them because

00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:31.748
he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices
