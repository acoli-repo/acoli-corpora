mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:03.249
as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.926
who would completely revolutionize everything

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:08.439
with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.597
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,

00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:13.150
so steam and things.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.823
Now, he needed accessories.

00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:16.495
Obviously, you've got a computer now.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:18.884
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.819
You need accessories you're going to come with.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.447
You're not just going to have that,

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.275
So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:27.429
so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:29.774
or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,

00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:31.744
there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)
