00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:31.815
and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,

00:06:31.815 --> 00:06:34.335
and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:37.192
inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:40.430
thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.379
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.135
(Laughter) Because of course,

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:51.050
there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.451
so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)

00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.789
Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.527
and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,

00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:02.317
and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
