not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,

00:04:30.013 --> 00:04:31.881
that is sitting there — you can go see it —

00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:34.322
waiting for the machine to be built.

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:37.742
And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:40.832
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.

00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:42.805
Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:44.977
in France, had created the Jacquard loom,

00:04:44.977 --> 00:04:47.655
which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:50.287
so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:52.392
and like everything else he did, he's using the technology

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:57.139
of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.077
mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year
