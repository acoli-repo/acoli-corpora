00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.233
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:02.843
you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah,

00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:06.178
I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,

00:11:06.178 --> 00:11:10.045
I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter)

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.644
But in between that we're going to do a simulation.

00:11:12.644 --> 00:11:14.401
Babbage himself wrote, he said,

00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:16.019
as soon as the analytical engine exists,

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:19.723
it will surely guide the future course of science.

00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:21.568
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling

00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:23.650
with new plans, but when it did get built, of course,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.160
in the 1940s, everything changed.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.983
Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like

00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:31.616
in motion with a video which shows
