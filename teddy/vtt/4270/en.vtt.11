00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:31.744
there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)

00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:33.280
And there's actually an instruction on the punch card

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.182
which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"

00:05:36.182 --> 00:05:38.382
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,

00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:39.463
this thing, "Click, clack click click click,"

00:05:39.463 --> 00:05:42.400
steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter)

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.835
You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:47.843
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for

00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:50.326
another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.261
which he never built, but which the Science Museum

00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.432
did build in the '80s and '90s.

00:05:54.432 --> 00:05:56.707
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.

00:05:56.707 --> 00:05:59.405
It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.922
but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,
