00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:31.748
he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:34.033
and never made any of them.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.318

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:39.329
Every time he had a good idea, he'd think,

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.777

basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.517
and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:56.669
"I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter)

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:58.649
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.088
the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,
