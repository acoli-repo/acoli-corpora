00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.639
except it was all made out of metal,

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.183
stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:37.253
Imagine a thing this high of cogs,

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:39.008
hundreds and hundreds of them,

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:40.898
and they've got numbers on them.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.317
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.902
And he thought about using binary. The problem

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:46.620
with using binary is that the machine would have been so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.937
tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:51.996
So he's got memory.

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:54.403
The memory is this bit over here.

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.733
You see it all like this.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:01.268
This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
