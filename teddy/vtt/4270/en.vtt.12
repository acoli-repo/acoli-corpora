00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.922
but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:05.694
so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.

00:06:05.694 --> 00:06:07.344
You also need graphics, right?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.496

This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:31.815
