This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:03.518
Of course, it's this big.

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:06.431
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.

00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:10.572
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU

00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:12.711
which is in the Science Museum.

00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:16.343
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic --

00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:18.796
so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division --

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.804
which already is a bit of a feat in metal,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:24.433
but it could also do something that a computer does

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.132
and a calculator doesn't:

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:30.070
this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
