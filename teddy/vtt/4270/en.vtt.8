00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:00.934
you'll see this. This all looks the same,

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.500
then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.483
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,

00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:09.576
but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.601
Babbage used the technology of the day

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:16.247
and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:19.116
which is punch cards. This thing over here

00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:21.940
is one of three punch card readers in here,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.620
and this is a program in the Science Museum, just

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.013
not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,
