00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:30.070
this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.936
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers,

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:35.076
and that fundamentally made it into a computer.

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:39.674
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:42.355
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.226
and we think about chips today, we can't

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:48.041
look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.842
Yet if you did, you would see something

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.664
very, very similar to this.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.611
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU,

00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.303
and this incredible regularity in the memory.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.965
If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:00.934
you'll see this. This all looks the same,
