00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.048
at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:32.478
the project to build a difference engine,

00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:35.036
and our plan is to build it.

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:38.902
Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.

00:10:38.902 --> 00:10:40.904
The project has a number of parts to it.

00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:43.424
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.

00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:45.346
That's been done. The second is now the study

00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:48.456
of all of those plans to determine what to build.

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:52.900
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.823
and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:58.399
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.233
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,
