in motion with a video which shows

00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:36.210
just one part of the CPU mechanism working.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.209
So this is just three sets of cogs,

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:45.031
and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:47.688
in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.

00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:48.847
So, give me five years.

00:11:48.847 --> 00:11:51.191
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:54.161
Thank you very much. (Applause)
