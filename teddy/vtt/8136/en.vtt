As an OB-GYN who specializes
in vulvovaginal disorders,

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.545
I hear a lot of myths
about vaginal yeast infections,

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.632
and the one that just won't go away
is that they're linked to too much sugar

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:12.842
in your diet.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.348
On the surface, the idea sounds plausible.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.601

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.854
not just for us,
but also for yeast and bacteria.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:27.356
So if we eat more sugar,
we're feeding the yeast.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.233
And there are studies

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:33.404
that show yeast infections
are more common in people with diabetes,
