00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:11.415
Imagine trying to use words 
to describe every scene in a film,

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.318
every note in your favorite song,

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.035
or every street in your town.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.859
Now imagine trying to do it using 
only the numbers 1 and 0.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.754
Every time you use the Internet
to watch a movie,

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:24.863
listen to music,

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:26.349
or check directions,

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.859
thatâ€™s exactly what your device is doing,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.812
using the language of binary code.
