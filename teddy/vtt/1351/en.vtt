00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first half of the 20th century

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
was an absolute disaster in human affairs,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a cataclysm.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We had the First World War,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the Great Depression,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the Second World War

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the rise of the communist nations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And each one of these forces

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
split the world, tore the world apart,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
divided the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they threw up walls --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
political walls, trade walls,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
transportation walls,
