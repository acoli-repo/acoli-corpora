priests,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:31.453
doctors,

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:32.694
and students.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.633
Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information,

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.099
are stored here.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.187
Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:44.667
as part of his training 
to become a scribe.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.843
He’s a particularly promising student,

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.253
but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe,

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.333
as was her father before her.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.002
Without family in the profession,

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.484
it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls,

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.700
to pursue this education.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.745
Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis.
