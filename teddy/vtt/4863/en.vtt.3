00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.477
After she utters the last line,

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:35.888
she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:39.706
Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question.

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:42.996
She wants to find out if she is pregnant.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:46.361
Peseshet explains 
her fail-safe pregnancy test:

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:50.000
plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.198
Then, urinate on the seeds every day.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:54.819
If the plants grow, she’s pregnant.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.250
A barley seedling predicts a baby boy,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.774
while emmer foretells a girl.

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:04.043
Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility.
