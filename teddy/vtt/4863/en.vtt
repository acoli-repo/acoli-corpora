00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.114
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt.

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:14.084
As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies.

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:14.924
Honey,

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:15.808
garlic,

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:16.537
cumin,

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.291
acacia leaves,

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.155
cedar oil.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.134
She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients.

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:25.722
Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.274
In order to become one,

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.036
she had to train as a scribe

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:34.541
and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life.
