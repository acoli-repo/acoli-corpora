00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.753
so they decide to give you all a test.

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:34.398
Through its universal translator,

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:37.962
the alien guarding you 
tells you the following:

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:43.423
You will be placed in a single-file line
facing forward in size order

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:47.344
so that each of you can see 
everyone lined up ahead of you.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:51.073
You will not be able to look behind you
or step out of line.

00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:55.304
Each of you will have either a black
or a white hat on your head

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:57.238
assigned randomly,

00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:01.255
and I won't tell you 
how many of each color there are.
