00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.256
so he knows that his must be 
one of the black hats

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.601
the first two prisoners saw.

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:05.337
Prisoner four hears that and knows

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:08.578
that she should be looking for 
an even number of black hats

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:10.510
since one was behind her.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.165
But she only sees one, so she deduces
that her hat is also black.

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:20.499
Prisoners five through nine are each
looking for an odd number of black hats,

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:25.227
which they see, so they figure out
that their hats are white.

00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:29.054
Now it all comes down to you
at the front of the line.

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.235
If the ninth prisoner saw 
an odd number of black hats,
