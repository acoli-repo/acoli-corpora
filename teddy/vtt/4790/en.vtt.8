If what they count doesn't match,
that means their own hat is that color.

00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:04.136
And everytime this happens,

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:08.883
the next person in line will switch
the parity they expect to see.

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:10.624
So that's it, you're free to go.

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.032
It looks like these aliens 
will have to go hungry,

00:04:13.032 --> 00:04:16.461
or find some less logical 
organisms to abduct.
