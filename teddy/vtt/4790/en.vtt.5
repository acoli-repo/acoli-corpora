00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:32.411
Let's see how it would play out
if the hats were distributed like this.

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:35.429
The tallest captive sees three black
hats in front of him,

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:40.634
so he says "black," telling everyone else
he sees an odd number of black hats.

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:44.006
He gets his own hat color wrong,
but that's okay

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:48.286
since you're collectively allowed 
to have one wrong answer.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.040
Prisoner two also sees an odd
number of black hats,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.251
so she knows hers is white,
and answers correctly.

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.044
Prisoner three sees 
an even number of black hats,

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.256
so he knows that his must be 
one of the black hats
