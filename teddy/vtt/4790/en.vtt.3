and then I'll line you up,
assign your hats, and we'll begin.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:36.042
Can you think of a strategy guaranteed
to save everyone?

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:39.137
Pause the video now 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:40.154
Answer in: 3

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:41.246
Answer in: 2

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:43.111
Answer in: 1

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.940
The key is that the person 
at the back of the line

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.494
who can see everyone else's hats
can use the words "black" or "white"

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:53.872
to communicate some coded information.

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:56.540
So what meaning can be 
assigned to those words

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.742
that will allow everyone else 
to deduce their hat colors?
