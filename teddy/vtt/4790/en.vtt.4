00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.742
that will allow everyone else 
to deduce their hat colors?

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:04.109
It can't be the total number
of black or white hats.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.872
There are more than two possible values,

00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:11.888
but what does have two possible values
is that number's parity,

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:15.192
that is whether it's odd or even.

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:19.008
So the solution is to agree
that whoever goes first will,

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.355
for example, say "black" if he sees
an odd number of black hats

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:27.787
and "white" if he sees 
an even number of black hats.

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:32.411
Let's see how it would play out
if the hats were distributed like this.
