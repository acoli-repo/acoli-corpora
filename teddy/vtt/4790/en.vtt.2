00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:01.255
and I won't tell you 
how many of each color there are.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:05.074
When I say to begin, each of you must
guess the color of your hat

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:09.474
starting with the person in the back
and moving up the line.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.522
And don't even try saying words
other than black or white

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:16.987
or signaling some other way,
like intonation or volume;

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:19.749
you'll all be eaten immediately.

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.117
If at least nine of you guess correctly,
you'll all be spared.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.243
You have five minutes to discuss
and come up with a plan,

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:31.991
and then I'll line you up,
assign your hats, and we'll begin.
