00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.235
If the ninth prisoner saw 
an odd number of black hats,

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:35.026
that can only mean one thing.

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:39.398
You'll find that this strategy works
for any possible arrangement of the hats.

00:03:39.398 --> 00:03:44.512
The first prisoner has a 50% chance of
giving a wrong answer about his own hat,

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:46.821
but the parity information he conveys

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:52.020
allows everyone else 
to guess theirs with absolute certainty.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.035
Each begins by expecting to see an odd
or even number of hats

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.066
of the specified color.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:02.502
If what they count doesn't match,
that means their own hat is that color.
