00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last year I showed these two slides so that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which for most of the last three million years

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
has been the size of the lower 48 states,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has shrunk by 40 percent.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the beating heart of the global climate system.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The next slide I show you will be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
