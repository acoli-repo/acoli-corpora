This is from our lab at Sussex.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.776
And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.176
which flashes red and back

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.456
either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.936
And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.080
people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.216
So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
in perceiving our bodies from within.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.336
There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.016
which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different
