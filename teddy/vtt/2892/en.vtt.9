00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.536
which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
whatever they may be.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.656
So perception --
figuring out what's there --

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.536
has to be a process of informed guesswork

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.696
in which the brain combines
these sensory signals

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.776
with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.936
to form its best guess
of what caused those signals.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.656
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.040
What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.960
Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this.
