You might have seen this illusion before,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.656
but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.736
If you look at those two patches, A and B,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.080
they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.016
But they are in fact
exactly the same shade.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.376
And I can illustrate this.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.616
If I put up a second version
of the image here

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.656
and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.336
you can see there's no difference.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.136
It's exactly the same shade of gray.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.816
And if you still don't believe me,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080
I'll bring the bar across
and join them up.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.040
It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.
