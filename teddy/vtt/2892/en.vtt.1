00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.376
of a continuity between then and now.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.616
Coming round from
anesthesia is very different.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.136
I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.576
five years or even 50 years.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.056
I simply wasn't there.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.320
It was total oblivion.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.296

And in this process

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040
is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.016
How does consciousness happen?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.256
Somehow, within each of our brains,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.176
the combined activity
of many billions of neurons,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.216
each one a tiny biological machine,
