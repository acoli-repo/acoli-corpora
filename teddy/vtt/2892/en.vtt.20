00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.416
Well, just the same principles apply.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.896
The brain makes its best guess

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.120
about what is and what is not
part of its body.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.616
And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.616
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.136
this is one you can do at home.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.056
All you need is one of these.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.336
(Laughter)

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.800
And a couple of paintbrushes.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.256
In the rubber hand illusion,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.256
a person's real hand is hidden from view,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.896
and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.176
Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.880
while the person stares at the fake hand.
