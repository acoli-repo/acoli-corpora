00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.216
each one a tiny biological machine,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.056
is generating a conscious experience.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.016
And not just any conscious experience --

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.421
your conscious experience
right here and right now.

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:09.645
How does this happen?

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.616
Answering this question is so important

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.496
because consciousness
for each of us is all there is.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520
Without it there's no world,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.776
there's no self,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.336
there's nothing at all.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.313
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:25.417
whether it's through
mental illness or pain.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.336
And if we can experience
joy and suffering,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800
what about other animals?
