00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.680
built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.496
Many experiments show,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.856
and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.776
that these different ways
in which we experience being a self

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.496
can all come apart.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.416
What this means is
the basic background experience

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.016
of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.696
Another experience,
which just like all others,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.920
requires explanation.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.496
So let's return to the bodily self.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.256
How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.536
and of having a body?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.416
Well, just the same principles apply.
