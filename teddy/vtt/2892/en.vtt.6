of explaining the properties
of living systems

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.456
in terms of physics and chemistry --

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.536
things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis --

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.376

So as with life, so with consciousness.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.056
Once we start explaining its properties

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.776
in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,
