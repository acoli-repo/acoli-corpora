00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.776
in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.216
the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.976
should start to fade away.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.720
At least that's the plan.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.536
So let's get started.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.536
What are the properties of consciousness?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.084
What should a science
of consciousness try to explain?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.656
Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.056
There are experiences
of the world around us,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.296
full of sights, sounds and smells,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.240
there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.560
And then there's conscious self.
