Now, these are fundamental changes

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.016
in how we understand ourselves,

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.896
but I think they should be celebrated,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.296
because as so often in science,
from Copernicus --

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.376
and a greater realization

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.000
that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.120
