00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.496
So you can measure
all kinds of clever things.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.816
You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.096
but there's no need.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.056
It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.496
This means that even experiences
of what our body is

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.056
is a kind of best guessing --

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.560
a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.680
There's one more thing.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.776
We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.536
we also experience them from within.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.800
We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.
