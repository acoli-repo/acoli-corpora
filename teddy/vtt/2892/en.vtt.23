We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.576
And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.656
are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.336
how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.576
lots of things.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.080
This kind of perception,
which we call interoception,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.096
is rather overlooked.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.536
But it's critically important

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.896
because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body --

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520
well, that's what keeps us alive.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.816
Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion.
