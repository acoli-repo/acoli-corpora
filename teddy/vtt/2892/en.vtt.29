00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.016
experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.720
than figuring out what's there.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.056
So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it --

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.336
well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.256
that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.040
to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.160
We predict ourselves into existence.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.000
Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.856
First, just as we can
misperceive the world,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.656
we can misperceive ourselves

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.816
when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.056
Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
