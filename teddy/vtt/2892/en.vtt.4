00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.336
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920
You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.896
In the story I'm going to tell you,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.256
our conscious experiences
of the world around us,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.616
and of ourselves within it,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.176
are kinds of controlled hallucinations

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.176
Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.936
about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.096
Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.336
But in fact,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.496
the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.
