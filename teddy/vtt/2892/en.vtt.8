00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.560
And then there's conscious self.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.536
The specific experience
of being you or being me.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.576
The lead character in this inner movie,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.960
and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.296
Let's start with experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.055
and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.839
Imagine being a brain.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.255
You're locked inside a bony skull,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.496
trying to figure
what's out there in the world.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.536
There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.336
All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.536
which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,
