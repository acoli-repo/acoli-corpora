00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800
what about other animals?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.736
Might they be conscious, too?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.416
Do they also have a sense of self?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.576
And as computers get faster and smarter,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.176
maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.936
when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.440
I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.336
And I think this because
my research is telling me

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.016
that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.616
and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.336
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.
