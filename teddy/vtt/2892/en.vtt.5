00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.496
the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.296
If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.480
you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.120
and sometimes even philosophers.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.776
All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.520
and what happens when it goes wrong.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.016
And the strategy is very simple.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.016
I'd like you to think about consciousness

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.256
in the way that we've
come to think about life.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.896
At one time, people thought
the property of being alive

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.536
could not be explained
by physics and chemistry --

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.720
that life had to be
more than just mechanism.
