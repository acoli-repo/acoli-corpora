00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.880
while the person stares at the fake hand.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.296
Now, for most people, after a while,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.416
this leads to the very uncanny sensation

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.040
that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.816
And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.216
on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.016
is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.256
that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.880
