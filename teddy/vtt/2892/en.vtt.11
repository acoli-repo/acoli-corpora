00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.040
It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.456
This isn't any kind of magic trick.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.896
It's the same shade of gray,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.120
but take it away again,
and it looks different.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.496
So what's happening here

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.336
is that the brain
is using its prior expectations

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.456
built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.176
that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.840
so that we see B as lighter
than it really is.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.176
Here's one more example,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.376
which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.696
to change what we consciously experience.
