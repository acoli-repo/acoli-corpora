00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.160
Just over a year ago,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.216
for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.520
I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.856
I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.080
and a coldness.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.296
And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.760
but definitely there.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.096
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.376
you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.136
but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.376
of a continuity between then and now.
