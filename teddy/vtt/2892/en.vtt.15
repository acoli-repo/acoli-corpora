00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.536
Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.536
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.896
on experience.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.816
In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world --

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.736
which is in this case Sussex campus --

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.320
into a psychedelic playground.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.616
We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.736
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.376
In this case, to see dogs.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.536
And you can see
this is a very strange thing.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.656
When perceptual
predictions are too strong,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.056
as they are here,
