00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.696
So our most basic experiences
of being a self,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.776
of being an embodied organism,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.760
are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.096
And when we follow this idea
all the way through,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.816
we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.576
since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.016
all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.656
We experience the world and ourselves

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.760
with, through and because of
our living bodies.
