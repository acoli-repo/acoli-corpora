00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.480
where we could get this residual
material of great quality,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.760
doomed to be crushed,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200
at a very low cost.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.960
Now, we had to convince our clients
that this was a good idea;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.640
but foremost, we had to come up
with a design process

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.040
to reuse these randomly shaped rocks,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.760
and we had not done this before.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Today everything would be much easier

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.560
because we would go to the quarry

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.040
with our smartphones
equipped with 3-D scanners

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.400
and we would document each rock,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.640
turn that into a digital model --
