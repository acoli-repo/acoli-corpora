00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.720
Four manifestos where
we are using the small scale

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.160
to ask ourselves big questions.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.200
And we are trying to discover
the architectures

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.400
that result from unconventional
applications of pretty mundane materials

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.920
and technologies,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.200
like concrete in different forms
in the top row,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
or steel and foam in the bottom row.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.440
Take, for instance,
these precast concrete beams.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.240
You have probably seen them

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.880
building bridges, highways,
water channels --

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.440
we found them on one of our visits
to a precast concrete factory.
