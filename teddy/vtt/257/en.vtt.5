turn that into a digital model --

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.880
highly engineer the whole process.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.560
But more than a decade ago,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.880
we had to embrace uncertainty

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.040
and put on our boots, roll up our sleeves

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.840
and move to the quarry
for a hands-on experience.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.640
And we also had to become the contractors

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.560
because we failed at finding somebody
willing to share the risk with us.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.040
Now, luckily, we convinced the quarry team
to help us build a few prototypes

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
to resolve some of the technical details.
