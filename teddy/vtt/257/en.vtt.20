00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.640
Or this fountain.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.160
Like this space topping a hill ...

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.240
or this theatre that brings to us
the space of the mountains

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.600
and its sound.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.480
And in order to realize this idea,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.400
construction cannot be perfectly planned.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.160
We need to embrace the drastic weather
and the local craft.
