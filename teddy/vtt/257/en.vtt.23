00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.760
And by using the resources
at our disposal in radical ways,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.480
by making a space for experimentation,

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.200
we are able to bring to light
architectures that find the beauty latent

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.240
in the raw and imperfect
things that surround us,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.160
that elevate them

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.160
and let them speak their own language.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.960
Thank you.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.280
