00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.680
even if just using what we have around
and we overlook all the time.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.160
And this is what I've been doing
along with my team,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.440
Ensamble Studio,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.560
and from our very early works

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.360
that happened
in strict historic contexts,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.040
like the city of Santiago de Compostela.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.560
Here we built the General Society
of Authors and Editors,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.560
a cultural building.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
And on top of all the regulations,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
we had to use stone by code

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.520
and our experience was limited,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.880
but we had incredible
references to learn from,
