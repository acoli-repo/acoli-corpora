00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.440
we found them on one of our visits
to a precast concrete factory.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.920
And they might not seem
especially homey or beautiful,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.040
but we decided to use them
to build our first house.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.040
And this was an incredible moment

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.480
because we got to be architects as always,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.800
builders once more

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.160
and, for the first time,
we could be our own clients.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.960
So, here we are trying to figure out
how we can take these huge catalogue beams

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.200
of about 20 tons each

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.320
and stack them progressively
around a courtyard space ...
