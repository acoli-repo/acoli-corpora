00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.080
A house that is for us a laboratory

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.960
where we are testing how we can use
standard elements in nonstandard ways.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.960
And we are observing
that the results are intriguing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.360
And we are learning by doing

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.440
that prefabrication
can be much more than stacking boxes

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.840
or that heavy parts
can be airy and transparent.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.080
And on top of designing
and building this house,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.440
we get invaluable feedback,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.560
sharing it with our family
and our friends
