00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.560
sharing it with our family
and our friends

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.480
because this is our life

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.160
and our work in progress.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.480
The lessons that we learn here
get translated into other projects

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.480
and other programs

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.600
and other scales as well,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.880
and they inspire new work.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.040
Here again we are looking
at very standard products:

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.840
galvanized steel studs
that can be easily cut and screwed,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.160
insulating foams, cement boards --

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.800
all materials that you can find
hidden in partition walls
