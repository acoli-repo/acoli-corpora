00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.240
to unite it with the rest of the building

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.600
was a piece of cake,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.760
because by having isolated uncertainty

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.520
and managed risk in the controlled
environment of the quarry,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.080
we were able to complete
the whole building in time

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.320
and on budget,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.040
even if using nonconventional
means and methods.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.600
And I still get goosebumps

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.120
when I see this big chunk
of the industrial landscape

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.600
in the city,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.960
in a building,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.720
experienced by the visitors
and the neighbors.
