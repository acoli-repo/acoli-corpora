00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.800
all materials that you can find
hidden in partition walls

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.760
and that we are exposing;

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.520
and we are using them to build
a very lightweight construction system

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.760
that can be built almost by anyone.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.080
And we are doing it ourselves
with our hands in our shop,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.280
and we are architects.
We're not professional builders

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.600
but we want to make sure it's possible.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.080
And it's so nice that Antón
can move it with his hands

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.720
and Javier can put it in a container,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.320
and we can ship it

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.560
like you would ship your belongings
if you were moving abroad ...
