00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.560
like you would ship your belongings
if you were moving abroad ...

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.440
which is what we did five years ago.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.400
We moved our gravity center from Madrid

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.400
and the house of the concrete
beams to Brookline.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.200
And we found the ugly duckling
of a very nice neighborhood:

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.080
a one-story garage
and the only thing we could afford.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.160
But it was OK because we wanted
to transform it into a swan,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.840
installing on top
our just-delivered kit of parts,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.160
once more becoming the scientists
and the guinea pigs.
