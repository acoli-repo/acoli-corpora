This building gave us
quite a few headaches,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.480
and so it could have well been
an exception in our work,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.800
but instead it started to inform
a modus operandi

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.200
where every project
becomes this opportunity

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.120
to test the limits of a discipline
we believe has to be urgently reimagined.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.680
So what you see here are four homes

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.280
that we have designed,
built and inhabited.
