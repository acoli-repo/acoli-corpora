00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.000
Architecture is a profession
with many rules,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.440
some written, some not,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.280
some relevant and others not.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.040
As architects,
we're constantly gravitating

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.160
between following these rules by the book

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560
or making a space for imagination --

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.880
for experimentation.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.440
This is a difficult balance.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.040
Especially through architecture,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.880
you're trying to challenge preconceptions
and push boundaries and innovate,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.680
even if just using what we have around
and we overlook all the time.
