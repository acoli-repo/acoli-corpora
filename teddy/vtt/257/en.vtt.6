00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
to resolve some of the technical details.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.560
And we agreed on a few mock-ups,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.080
but we got excited,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360
and one stone led to another

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.240
until we succeeded to build

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.400
an 18-meter-long
by eight-meter-high structure

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.960
that recycled all the amorphous
material of the quarry,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.720
just supported by gravity --

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000
no mortar and no ties.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.280
And once built and tested,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.720
moving it to the final site
in the city center

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.240
to unite it with the rest of the building
