00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.840
So we decided to explode the center
into a constellation of fragments,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.560
of spaces spread
across the vast territory

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.600
that would immerse the visitors
into the wilderness of this amazing place.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.800
So back in the office,
we are thinking through making,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.120
using the land both as support
and as material,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.040
learning from its geological processes
of sedimentation, erosion,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.360
fragmentation, crystallization --

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.240
explosion --

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.760
to discover architectures
that are born from the land,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.120
that are visceral extensions
of the landscape,
