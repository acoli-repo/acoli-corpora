00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.000
to better understand the process
that transforms a mountain

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.800
into a perfectly square tile
that you buy from a supplier.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.600
And we were taken by the monumental
scale of the material

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.720
and the actions to extract it.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.760
And looking carefully,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.320
we noticed hundreds of irregular
blocks piling up everywhere.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.760
They are the leftovers
of an extraction sequence:

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920
the ugly parts that nobody wants.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200
But we wanted them.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000
We were inspired.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.640
And it was a win-win situation

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.480
where we could get this residual
material of great quality,
