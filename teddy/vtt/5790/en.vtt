00:00:02.287 --> 00:00:05.067
(Birds chirping)

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:11.691
What you're hearing

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.336
is the sound of a native
forest in Southern Europe.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.861
The calm, tranquil feeling
we all get is not a coincidence.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.686
We all evolved in ecosystems like this,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.816
where the sounds of birds and insects

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.726
indicated the possibility
of food, medicines

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.336
and all the resources
we need for survival.
