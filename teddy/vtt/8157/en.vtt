00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:04.996

Pakistan, is under water.

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:08.636
An exceptional monsoon
coupled with flash flooding

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:12.476
due to the accelerated melting
of the Himalayan glaciers

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:15.116
has led to devastating flooding.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.916
Floods so destructive, so all-consuming,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:24.636
that the adjective most frequently used
to describe them is “biblical.”

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:30.916
The area of land that is underwater
is larger than Britain.
