00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:01.191
are also fundamental to brain health
and early cognitive development.

00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:04.567
In order for the brain to efficiently
transform and synthesize

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.101
these valuable nutrients,

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.441
it needs fuel, and lots of it.

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.881
While the human brain only
makes up about 2% of our body weight,

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.646
it uses up to 20% of our energy resources.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:19.691
Most of this energy comes 
from carbohydrates

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.106
that our body digests into glucose,
or blood sugar.

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:28.004
The frontal lobes are so sensitive
to drops in glucose, in fact,

00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:31.786
that a change in mental function
is one of the primary signals
