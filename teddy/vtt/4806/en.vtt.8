00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.135
A high glycemic food, like white bread,

00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.639
causes a rapid release of glucose
into the blood,

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.915
and then comes the dip.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:12.473
Blood sugar shoots down,
and with it, our attention span and mood.

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:17.941
On the other hand, oats, grains,
and legumes have slower glucose release,

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.288
enabling a steadier level 
of attentiveness.

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.035
For sustained brain power,

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:27.199
opting for a varied diet of nutrient-rich
foods is critical.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.980
When it comes to what you bite,
chew, and swallow,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.537
your choices have a direct
and long-lasting effect
