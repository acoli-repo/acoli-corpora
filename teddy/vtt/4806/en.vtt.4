00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.754
can stimulate brain cells to release
mood-altering norepinephrine,

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.101
dopamine,

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.723
and serotonin.

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:09.755
But getting to your brain cells is tricky,

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.264
and amino acids have to compete
for limited access.

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:17.412
A diet with a range of foods helps 
maintain a balanced combination

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:19.287
of brain messengers,

00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:23.633
and keeps your mood from getting skewed
in one direction or the other.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:25.535
Like the other organs in our bodies,

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:30.151
our brains also benefit from a steady
supply of micronutrients.
