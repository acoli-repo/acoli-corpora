of carbohydrates we eat affect our brains?

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.225
Carbs come in three forms:

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:44.985
starch,

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:45.759
sugar,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.191
and fiber.

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.856
While on most nutrition labels,

affect how the body and brain respond.

00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.135
A high glycemic food, like white bread,
