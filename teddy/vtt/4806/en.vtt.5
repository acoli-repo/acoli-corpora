00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:30.151
our brains also benefit from a steady
supply of micronutrients.

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.320
Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.326
strengthen the brain to fight off
free radicals that destroy brain cells,

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:41.223
enabling your brain to work well
for a longer period of time.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.298
And without powerful micronutrients,

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.602
like the vitamins B6,

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:45.764
B12,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.257
and folic acid,

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:51.869
our brains would be susceptible 
to brain disease and mental decline.

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.633
Trace amounts of the minerals iron,

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:54.462
copper,

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:55.288
zinc,

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:56.288
and sodium

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:01.191
are also fundamental to brain health
and early cognitive development.
