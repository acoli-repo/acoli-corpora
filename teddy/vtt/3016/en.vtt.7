00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.438
where temperatures can rise
up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.

00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:36.438
So what I do is I use computer simulations

00:03:36.462 --> 00:03:41.295
in order to analyze but also to predict
the behavior of these storms

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.100
when they're just born at the Sun.

00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.018
This is only one part
of the story, though.

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:53.344
When these solar storms
are moving in space,

00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:56.974
some of them will inevitably
encounter space probes

00:03:56.998 --> 00:04:01.606
that we humans have sent
in order to explore other worlds.
