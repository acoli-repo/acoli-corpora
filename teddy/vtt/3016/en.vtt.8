WEBVTT

00:03:56.998 --> 00:04:01.606
that we humans have sent
in order to explore other worlds.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.938
What I mean by other worlds is,
for example, planets,

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:07.062
such as Venus or Mercury,

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.806
but also objects, such as comets.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.170
And while these space probes
have been made

00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:15.905
for different scientific endeavors,

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:21.066
they can also act like tiny
cosmic meteorological stations

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.083
and monitor the evolution
of these space storms.

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.314
So I, with a group of researchers,
gather and analyze this data
