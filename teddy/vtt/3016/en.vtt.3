00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:30.650
At the beginning of the space
exploration age 50 years ago only,

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.832
the probes we sent in space

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.670
revealed that the planets
in our Solar System

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:40.144
constantly bathe in a stream of particles
that are coming from the Sun

00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:42.769
and that we call the solar wind.

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:47.339
And in the same way that global wind
patterns here on Earth

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:49.561
can be affected by hurricanes,

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.346
the solar wind is sometimes
affected by solar storms

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.546
that I like to call "space hurricanes."

00:01:57.687 --> 00:01:59.640
When they arrive at planets,

00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:01.889
they can perturb the space environment,
