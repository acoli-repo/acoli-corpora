00:00:01.927 --> 00:00:04.857
It is almost the end of the winter,

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:07.452
and you've woken up to a cold house,

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:10.873
which is weird, because
you left the heater on all night.

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:13.425
You turn on the light.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.699
It's not working.

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:20.519
Actually, the coffee maker, the TV --
none of them are working.

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.732
Life outside also seems to have stopped.

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:26.624
There are no schools,

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.889
most of the businesses are shut,

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:30.939
and there are no working trains.
