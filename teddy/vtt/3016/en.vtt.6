00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:02.700
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though,

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.115
we now know where
the solar storms come from.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:07.698
They come from regions of the Sun

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:11.014
where a tremendous amount
of energy is being stored.

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:12.550
You have an example here,

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:16.384
as a complex structure
hanging above the solar surface,

00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:18.829
just on the verge of erupting.

00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:22.763
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes

00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:26.206
in the scorching hot
atmosphere of the Sun,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.438
where temperatures can rise
up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.
