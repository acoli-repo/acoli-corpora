00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.314
So I, with a group of researchers,
gather and analyze this data

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.387
coming from different
locations of the Solar System.

00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:36.727
And by doing so, my research
shows that, actually,

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:38.839
solar storms have a generic shape,

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:43.368
and that this shape evolves
as solar storms move away from the Sun.

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:44.547
And you know what?

00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:49.904
This is key for building tools
to predict space weather.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.505
I would like to leave you
with this beautiful image.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.938
This is us here on Earth,

00:04:57.692 --> 00:04:59.009
this pale blue dot.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:03.400
And while I study the Sun
and its storms every day,
