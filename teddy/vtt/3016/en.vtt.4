00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:01.889
they can perturb the space environment,

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:05.198
which in turn creates
the northern or southern lights,

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:07.410
for example, here on Earth,

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:09.302
but also Saturn

00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:11.906
and also Jupiter.

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.839
Luckily, here on Earth,

00:02:15.863 --> 00:02:18.954
we are protected
by our planet's natural shield,

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:22.089
a magnetic bubble that we call
the magnetosphere

00:02:22.113 --> 00:02:24.491
and that you can see here
on the right side.

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.529
Nonetheless, solar storms
can still be responsible

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:33.167
for disrupting satellite
telecommunications and operations,
