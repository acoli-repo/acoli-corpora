00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.289
and a constant reminder that we live
in the neighborhood of an active star.

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:03.765
And I, as a solar physicist,

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.509
I have a tremendous chance
to study these solar storms.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.254
But you see, "solar storm chaser"

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.950
is not just a cool title.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.435
My research helps to understand
where they come from,

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:17.903
how they behave

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:19.102
and, in the long run,

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:22.124
aims to mitigate their effects
on human societies,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.830
which I'll get to in a second.

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:30.650
At the beginning of the space
exploration age 50 years ago only,
