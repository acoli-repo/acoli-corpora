00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:30.939
and there are no working trains.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.558
This is not the opening scene
of a zombie apocalypse movie.

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:42.244
This is what happened in March 1989
in the Canadian province of Quebec,

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.948
when the power grid lost power.

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:46.686
The culprit?

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.304
A solar storm.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.614
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles

00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:54.916
escaping from the Sun from time to time,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.289
and a constant reminder that we live
in the neighborhood of an active star.
