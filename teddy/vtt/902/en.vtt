00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am going to be talking about secrets.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Obviously the best way to divulge a secret

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is to tell someone to not say anything about it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You just press it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, man. Um, yes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes. I'm sure! Just change it!
