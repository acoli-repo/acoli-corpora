Can geographic information

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
make you healthy?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In 2001 I got hit by a train.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My train was a heart attack.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I found myself in a hospital

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in an intensive-care ward,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
recuperating from emergency surgery.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I suddenly realized something:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I was completely in the dark.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Why now?" "Why here?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"Could my doctor have warned me?"
