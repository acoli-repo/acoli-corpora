00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.312
even when many 
are confident in their choice.

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.788
Memory based on short glimpses
can be unreliable,

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:07.204
and we often overestimate 
our own accuracy.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:08.164
Knowing all this,

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.093
a unanimous identification starts to seem
less like certain guilt,

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:14.705
and more like a systemic error,

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:17.024
or bias in the lineup.

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:21.013
And systemic errors don't just appear
in matters of human judgement.

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:23.364
From 1993-2008,

00:02:23.364 --> 00:02:28.835
the same female DNA was found 
in multiple crime scenes around Europe,

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:34.433
incriminating an elusive killer
dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn.
