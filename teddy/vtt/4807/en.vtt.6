00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:06.368
which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters
with all 100% supposedly voting in favor

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:09.456
of another seven-year term.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.839
When you look at it this way,

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.121
the paradox of unanimity isn't actually
all that paradoxical.

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.244
Unanimous agreement 
is still theoretically ideal,

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:23.588
especially in cases when you'd expect very
low odds of variability and uncertainty,

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:24.557
but in practice,

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:29.058
achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:34.180
should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system.
