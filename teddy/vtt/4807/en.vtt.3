00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.541
But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads,

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.177
you'd suspect that something was wrong,

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.972
not with your individual flips,

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:39.001
but with the coin itself.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.806
Of course, suspect identifications aren't
as random as coin tosses,

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:48.339
but they're not as clear cut 
as telling apples from bananas, either.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:54.203
In fact, a 1994 study found 
that up to 48% of witnesses

00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:56.967
tend to pick the wrong 
person out of a lineup,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.312
even when many 
are confident in their choice.
