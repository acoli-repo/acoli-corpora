00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:01.894
is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:05.783
involved in the type of situation 
you're dealing with.

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:09.936
If we asked witnesses to identify
the apple in this lineup, for example,

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:13.389
we shouldn't be surprised 
by a unanimous verdict.

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.500
But in cases where we have 
reason to expect some natural variance,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.334
we should also expect varied distribution.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.460
If you toss a coin one hundred times,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.156
you would expect to get heads
somewhere around 50% of the time.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.541
But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads,
