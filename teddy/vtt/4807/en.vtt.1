00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:34.693
After all, much of our society
relies on majority vote and consensus,

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:35.693
whether it's politics,

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:36.693
business,

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:37.751
or entertainment.

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.030
So it's natural to think
that more consensus is a good thing.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.863
And up until a certain point, 
it usually is.

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:48.986
But sometimes, the closer you start to get
to total agreement,

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.590
the less reliable the result becomes.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.032
This is called the paradox of unanimity.

00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:58.347
The key to understanding 
this apparent paradox

00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:01.894
is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty
