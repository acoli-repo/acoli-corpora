00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:02.954
As a little Black girl,

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:04.871
I did not know

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:08.788
that American history had anything to do
with someone who looked like me.

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:13.496
American history was George Washington
cutting down his cherry tree.

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:16.121
American history was white.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:21.204
Raised in a small steel mining town
of Duquesne, Pennsylvania,

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:25.746
my family moved to Newark, Ohio,
not New Jersey, but Ohio,

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:27.371
when I was age nine.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:31.954
And one day the teacher asked us
to talk about our family backgrounds.
