Let me start by asking you a
question, just with a show of hands:

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:05.236
Who has an iPhone?

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:08.326
Who has an Android phone?

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:10.394
Who has a Blackberry?

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.768
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:15.351
(Laughter)

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.439
And let me guess, how many of you,

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.447
when you arrived here, like me, went and bought

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:23.237
a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:24.637
I'll bet you didn't even know

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.615
you're using African technology.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.898
Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:31.968
pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom
