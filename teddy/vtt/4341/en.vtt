You may have noticed
that I'm wearing two different shoes.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.390
It probably looks funny --

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.136
it definitely feels funny --

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.840
but I wanted to make a point.

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.884
Let's say my left shoe corresponds
to a sustainable footprint,

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:20.106
meaning we humans consume
less natural resources

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.354
than our planet can regenerate,

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.890
and emit less carbon dioxide
than our forests and oceans can reabsorb.

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:29.568
That's a stable and healthy condition.
