00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.432
The term organic describes

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:35.306
that the material used
for light absorption and charge transport

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.424
are mainly based on the element carbon,

00:03:37.448 --> 00:03:38.643
and not on metals.

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.053
We utilize the mixture of a polymer

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:44.636
which is set up by different
repeating units,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.690
like the pearls in a pearl chain,

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:49.690
and a small molecule
which has the shape of a football

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:51.059
and is called fullerene.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.781
These two compounds are mixed
and dissolved to become an ink.

00:03:56.413 --> 00:03:57.570
And like ink,

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:02.020
they can be printed with simple
printing techniques like slot-die coating
