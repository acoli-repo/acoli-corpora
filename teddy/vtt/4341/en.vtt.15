They are scaling up their capacities,

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.128
and so are we, with the inks.

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:37.763
(Shoe drops)

00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:43.554
This smaller footprint
is much more comfortable.

00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:45.046
(Laughter)

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.585
It is the right size, the right scale.

00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:51.998
We have to come back to the right scale
when it comes to energy consumption.

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.618
And making buildings carbon-neutral
is an important part here.

00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.482
In Europe,

00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.593
we have the goal to decarbonize
our building stock [by] 2050.
