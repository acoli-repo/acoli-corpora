00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:31.631
They aren't designed
for snow in winter, for instance,

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:35.823
so heavy silicon solar cells
cannot be used for light harvesting,

00:05:35.847 --> 00:05:38.856
but these lightweight solar foils
are very well suited.

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.521
The bendability is important

00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:46.122
if you want to combine the solar cell
with membrane architecture.

00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:50.383
Imagine the sails
of the Sydney Opera as power plants.

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:53.258
Alternatively, you can
combine the solar foils

00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:55.823
with conventional construction
materials like glass.

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:58.849
Many glass facade elements
contain a foil anyway,

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:00.566
to create laminated safety glass.
