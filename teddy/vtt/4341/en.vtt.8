00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:02.020
they can be printed with simple
printing techniques like slot-die coating

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:05.855
in a continuous roll-to-roll process
on flexible substrates.

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:09.220
The resulting thin layer
is the active layer,

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:11.077
absorbing the energy of the sun.

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:14.481
This active layer is extremely effective.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:18.927
You only need a layer thickness
of 0.2 micrometers

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:20.713
to absorb the energy of the sun.

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.767
This is 100 times thinner
than a human hair.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:26.845
To give you another example,

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.566
take one kilogram of the basic polymer

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.801
and use it to formulate the active ink.
