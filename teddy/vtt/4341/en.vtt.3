00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:31.311
how a new solar technology can contribute
to a sustainable future of buildings.

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:36.761
Buildings consume about 40 percent
of our total energy demand,

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:38.139
so tackling this consumption

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:40.753
would significantly reduce
our climate emissions.

00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:43.755
A building designed
along sustainable principles

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.163
can produce all the power
it needs by itself.

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:47.964
To achieve this,

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:51.346
you first have to reduce
the consumption as much as possible,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.263
by using well-insulated walls
or windows, for instance.

00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:56.819
These technologies
are commercially available.

00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:00.466
Then you need energy
for warm water and heating.
