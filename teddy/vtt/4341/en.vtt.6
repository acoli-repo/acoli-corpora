00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.872
but they aren't really flexible
in terms of their design,

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:02.719
and this makes aesthetics a challenge.

00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:05.575
People often imagine pictures like this

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.032
when thinking about
solar cells on buildings.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:09.962
This may work for solar farms,

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:13.390
but when you think of buildings,
of streets, of architecture,

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:14.836
aesthetics does matter.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.543
This is the reason why we don't see
many solar cells on buildings today.

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:20.892
They just don't match.

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:26.073
Our team is working on a totally
different solar-cell technology,

00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:29.571
which is called
organic photovoltaics or OPV.

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.432
The term organic describes
