00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:30.644
In the case of integrated solar cells,

00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:34.117
at the site of construction,
only one element is installed,

00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.602
being at the same time
the envelope of the building

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:37.776
and the solar cell.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:40.829
Besides saving on the installation costs,

00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:42.775
this also saves resources,

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:46.223
because the two functions
are combined into one element.

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:48.144
Earlier, I've talked about optics.

00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:49.945
I really like this solar panel --

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:53.287
maybe you have different taste
or different design needs ...

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:55.318
No problem.

00:06:55.342 --> 00:06:56.606
With the printing process,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.905
the solar cell can change
its shape and design very easily.
