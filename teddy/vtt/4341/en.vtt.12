00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:00.566
to create laminated safety glass.

00:06:01.148 --> 00:06:04.667
It's not a big deal to add
a second foil in the production process,

00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:07.603
but then the facade element
contains the solar cell

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:09.489
and can produce electricity.

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:12.749
Besides looking nice,

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:16.950
these integrated solar cells come along
with two more important benefits.

00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:21.298
Do you remember the solar cell
attached to a roof I showed before?

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.991
In this case, we install the roof first,

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:25.907
and as a second layer, the solar cell.

00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:27.931
This is adding on the installation costs.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:30.644
In the case of integrated solar cells,
