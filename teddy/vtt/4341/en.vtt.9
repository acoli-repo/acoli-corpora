00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.801
and use it to formulate the active ink.

00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:33.911
With this amount of ink,

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:37.941
you can print a solar cell
the size of a complete football field.

00:04:39.114 --> 00:04:42.798
So OPV is extremely material efficient,

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:46.112
which I think is a crucial thing
when talking about sustainability.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.235
After the printing process,

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.980
you can have a solar module
which could look like this ...

00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:55.011
It looks a bit like a plastic foil

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.915
and actually has many of its features.

00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:58.775
It's lightweight ...
