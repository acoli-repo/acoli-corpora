00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.593
we have the goal to decarbonize
our building stock [by] 2050.

00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:04.596
I hope organic photovoltaics
will be a big part of this.

00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:07.588
Here are a couple of examples.

00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:12.570
This is the first commercial installation
of fully printed organic solar cells.

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:17.029
"Commercial" means that the solar cells
were printed on industrial equipment.

00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:21.289
The so-called "solar trees"
were part of the German pavilion

00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:23.713
at the World Expo in Milan in 2015.

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:26.662
They provided shading during the day

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.957
and electricity
for the lighting in the evening.

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:33.272
You may wonder why this hexagonal shape
was chosen for the solar cells.
