00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:00.466
Then you need energy
for warm water and heating.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.810
You can get this
in a renewable way from the sun

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.648
through solar-thermal installations

00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.999
or from the ground and air,
with heat pumps.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:09.983
All of these technologies are available.

00:02:10.972 --> 00:02:13.323
Then you are left
with the need for electricity.

00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:17.860
In principle, there are several ways
to get renewable electricity,

00:02:17.884 --> 00:02:21.154
but how many buildings do you know
which have a windmill on the roof

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:23.141
or a water power plant in the garden?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.509
Probably not so many, because usually,
it doesn't make sense.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:30.042
But the sun provides abundant energy
to our roofs and facades.
