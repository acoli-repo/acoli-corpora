00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:30.042
But the sun provides abundant energy
to our roofs and facades.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.840
The potential to harvest this energy
at our buildings' surfaces is enormous.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.502
Let's take Europe as an example.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:43.460
If you would utilize all areas
which have a nice orientation to the sun

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.167
and they're not overly shaded,

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:48.226
the power generated by photovoltaics

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.715
would correspond to about 30 percent
of our total energy demand.

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:54.871
But today's photovoltaics
have some issues.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.180
They do offer a good
cost-performance ratio,

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.872
but they aren't really flexible
in terms of their design,
