00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.912
We all know the devastating effects
of this excessive exploitation:

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.323
global warming,

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:07.085
rising of the sea levels,

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.416
melting of the glaciers and polar ice,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.865
increasingly extreme
climate patterns and more.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.079
The enormity of this problem
really frustrates me.

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:21.649
What frustrates me even more
is that there are solutions to this,

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.026
but we keep doing things
like we always did.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.363
Today I want to share with you

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:31.311
how a new solar technology can contribute
to a sustainable future of buildings.
