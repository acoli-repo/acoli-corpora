00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.595
semitransparent OPV panels
are integrated into the glass facade,

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:02.892
serving different needs.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.798
First, they provided shading
for the meeting rooms behind.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:12.199
Second, the logo of the company
is displayed in an innovative way.

00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:14.533
And of course, electricity is produced,

00:09:14.557 --> 00:09:16.880
reducing the energy footprint
of the building.

00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:19.398
This is pointing towards a future

00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:21.869
where buildings are no longer
energy consumers,

00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:23.309
but energy providers.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.899
I want to see solar cells
seamlessly integrated

00:09:26.923 --> 00:09:28.802
into our building shells

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.878
to be both resource-efficient
and a pleasure to look at.
