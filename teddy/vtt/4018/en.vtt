Economists have been exploring
people's behavior for hundreds of years:

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.456
how we make decisions,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.536
how we act individually and in groups,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.280
how we exchange value.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.216
They've studied the institutions
that facilitate our trade,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.656
like legal systems,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.920
corporations,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.720
marketplaces.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.056

technological institution

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.096
that will fundamentally change
how we exchange value,
