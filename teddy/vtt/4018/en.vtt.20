00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.280
is one of the most open-ended,
and it's reneging.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.416
What if you don't send me the smartphone?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.000
Can I get my money back?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.496
Blockchains allow us to write code,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.216
binding contracts,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.896
between individuals

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.576
and then guarantee
that those contracts will bear out

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.560
without a third party enforcer.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.616
So if we look at the smartphone example,
you could think about escrow.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.736
You are financing that phone,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.296
but you don't need to release the funds

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.136
until you can verify
that all the conditions have been met.
