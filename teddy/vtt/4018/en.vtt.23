like banks, our governments,
our corporations,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.736
we can actually harness
all of that collective uncertainty

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.360
and use it to collaborate and exchange
more and faster and more open.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.856
Now, I don't want you
to get the impression

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.256
that the blockchain
is the solution to everything,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.200
even though the media has said
that it's going to end world poverty,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.576
it's also going to solve
the counterfeit drug problem

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.800
and potentially save the rainforest.
