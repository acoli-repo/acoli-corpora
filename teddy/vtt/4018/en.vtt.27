Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.576
I think I understood that it's coming,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.496
it offers a lot of potential,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.696
and it's complex.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.800
What is your estimate
for the rate of adoption?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.736
Bettina Warburg: I think
that's a really good question.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.176
My lab is pretty much focused

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.656
on going the enterprise
and government route first,
