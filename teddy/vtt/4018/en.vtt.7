00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.160
of who owns what and who transacts what.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.896
The transactions are secured
through cryptography,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.696
and over time, that transaction history
gets locked in blocks of data

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.200
that are then cryptographically
linked together and secured.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.536
This creates an immutable,
unforgeable record

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.376
of all of the transactions
across this network.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.800
This record is replicated
on every computer that uses the network.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.480
It's not an app.
