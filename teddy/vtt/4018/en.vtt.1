00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.096
that will fundamentally change
how we exchange value,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.600
and it's called the blockchain.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.696
Now, that's a pretty bold statement,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.856
but if you take nothing else
away from this talk,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.616
I actually want you to remember

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.576
that while blockchain technology
is relatively new,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.976
it's also a continuation
of a very human story,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.520
and the story is this.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.096
As humans, we find ways

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.936
to lower uncertainty about one another

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760
so that we can exchange value.
