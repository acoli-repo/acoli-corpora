00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.256
because for the first time,
we can lower uncertainty

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.856
not just with political
and economic institutions,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.616
like our banks, our corporations,
our governments,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.000
but we can do it with technology alone.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.936
So what is the blockchain?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.016
Blockchain technology
is a decentralized database

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.576
that stores a registry
of assets and transactions

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.400
across a peer-to-peer network.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.296
It's basically a public registry

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.160
of who owns what and who transacts what.
