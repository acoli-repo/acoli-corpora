00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.575
Now, one of the first people
to really explore the idea

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.776
of institutions as a tool in economics

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.256
to lower our uncertainties
about one another

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.176
and be able to do trade

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.840
was the Nobel economist Douglass North.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.816
He passed away at the end of 2015,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.560
but North pioneered what's called
"new institutional economics."

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.296
And what he meant by institutions
were really just formal rules

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.296
like a constitution,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.240
and informal constraints, like bribery.
