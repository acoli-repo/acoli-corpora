00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.496
and how they therefore promise
to transform our economic systems

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.720
in radical ways.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.216
So uncertainty is kind of a big term

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.616
in economics,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.696
but I want to go through three forms of it

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.096
that we face in almost all
of our everyday transactions,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.216
where blockchains can play a role.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.616
We face uncertainties

and not having recourse
if things go wrong.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.880
So let's take the first example,
not knowing who we're dealing with.
