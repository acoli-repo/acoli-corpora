00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.056
they become a technological institution

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.856
that has a lot of the benefits

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.080
of the traditional institutions
we're used to using in society,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.120
but it does this in a decentralized way.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.896
It does this by converting
a lot of our uncertainties

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.120
into certainties.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.896
So I think we need to start
preparing ourselves,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.456
because we are about to face a world

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.616
where distributed, autonomous institutions

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640
have quite a significant role.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.816
Thank you.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.200
