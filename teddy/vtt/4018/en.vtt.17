00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.775
Using the blockchain, we can create

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.559
a shared reality
across nontrusting entities.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.856
By this I mean

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.256
all of these nodes in the network
do not need to know each other

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.696
or trust each other,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.856
because they each have the ability

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.960
to monitor and validate
the chain for themselves.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.776
Think back to Wikipedia.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.976
It's a shared database,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.816
and even though it has multiple readers

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.936
and multiple writers at the same time,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.680
it has one single truth.
