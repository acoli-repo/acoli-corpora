00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.296
As our societies grew more complex

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.536
and our trade routes grew more distant,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.576
we built up more formal institutions,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.936
institutions like banks for currency,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.656
governments, corporations.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.216
These institutions
helped us manage our trade

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.256
as the uncertainty
and the complexity grew,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880
and our personal control was much lower.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.840
Eventually with the internet,
we put these same institutions online.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.976
We built platform marketplaces
like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,
