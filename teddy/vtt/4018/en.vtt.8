It's not an app.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.320
It's not a company.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.880
I think it's closest in description
to something like Wikipedia.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.856
We can see everything on Wikipedia.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.536
We can also track those changes
over time on Wikipedia,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.856
and we can create our own wikis,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.720

they're just a data infrastructure.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.096
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform
that stores words and images
