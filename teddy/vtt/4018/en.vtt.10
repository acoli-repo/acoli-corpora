It could be a certificate, a contract,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.896
real world objects,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.720
even personal identifiable information.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.936
There are of course other
technical details to the blockchain,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.976
but at its core, that's how it works.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.336
It's this public registry
that stores transactions in a network

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.560
and is replicated so that it's very secure
and hard to tamper with.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.256
Which brings me to my point

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.336
of how blockchains lower uncertainty

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.496
and how they therefore promise
to transform our economic systems
