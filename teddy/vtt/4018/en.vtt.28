00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.656
on going the enterprise
and government route first,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.216
because in reality,
blockchain is a complex technology.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.016
How many of you actually understand
how the internet works?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.696
But you use it every day,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.496
so I think we're sort of facing
the same John Sculley idea

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.176
of technology should either be
invisible or beautiful,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.056
and blockchain is kind of
neither of those things right now,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.056
so it's better suited
for either really early adopters

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.296
who kind of get it and can tinker around

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.296
or for finding those best use cases
