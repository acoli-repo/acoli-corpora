00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.016
it means you can selectively reveal

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.976
the different attributes about you

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.296
that help facilitate trade or interaction,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.176
for instance that a government
issued you an ID,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.456
or that you're over 21,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.096
by revealing the cryptographic proof

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.000
that these details exist
and are signed off on.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.016
Having this kind of portable identity

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.056
around the physical world
and the digital world

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.376
means we can do all kinds of human trade

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.800
in a totally new way.
