So let's take the first example,
not knowing who we're dealing with.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.080
Say I want to buy
a used smartphone on eBay.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.080
The first thing I'm going to do
is look up who I'm buying from.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.336
Are they a power user?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.480
Do they have great reviews and ratings,
or do they have no profile at all?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.736
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.376
these are the attestations
about our identities

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.016
that we cobble together today

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.480
and use to lower uncertainty
about who we're dealing with.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.856
But the problem is
they're very fragmented.
