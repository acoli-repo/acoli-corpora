00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.976
We built platform marketplaces
like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.536
just faster institutions
that act as middlemen

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.480
to facilitate human economic activity.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.976
As Douglass North saw it,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.656
institutions are a tool
to lower uncertainty

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.000
so that we can connect and exchange
all kinds of value in society.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.176
And I believe we are now entering

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.176
a further and radical evolution

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.656
of how we interact and trade,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.256
because for the first time,
we can lower uncertainty
