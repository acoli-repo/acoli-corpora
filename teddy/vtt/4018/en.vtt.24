and potentially save the rainforest.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.296
The truth is, this technology
is in its infancy,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.536
and we're going to need to see
a lot of experiments take place

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.976
and probably fail

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.536
before we truly understand
all of the use cases

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.760
for our economy.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.416
But there are tons of people
working on this,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.136
from financial institutions

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.320
to technology companies,
start-ups and universities.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.056
And one of the reasons is
that it's not just an economic evolution.
