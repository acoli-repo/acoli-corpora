Pat Mitchell: Welcome, Megan.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.130
Megan McArthur: Hello, Pat,
thank you for having me.

00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:08.297
PM: Let's go with the question
that I think is probably coming up

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.630
for many of us.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.330
This is unusual.

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:13.197

met during your training,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.863
and in the year that you got married,

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:20.563
you both flew into space, separately.

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:23.397
You, on the Hubble Telescope mission

00:00:23.397 --> 00:00:27.197
and Bob on the mission to construct
the space station.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.463
And ironically, if your mission
had gone awry or needed help,
