Part of it is, yes, we're showing off,
because we can do this,

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.623
but the other part is this connects him
to what will be a part of him.

00:07:35.647 --> 00:07:38.279
That is something really valuable;
we believe in that.

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:40.260
Tattoos are especially exciting for us.

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:42.081
What happens if you take the tattoo,

00:07:42.105 --> 00:07:45.292
which is a combination
of somebody's personal taste and choice,

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:46.902
and their morphology,

00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:49.329
but now, let's say, you remove the person.

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:53.341
You get a free-floating tattoo
defining their body.

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:57.708
So everything we do is about recreating
and expressing something

00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:59.469
that means something to that person,

00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:02.039
and expressing that through
what would be their body,
