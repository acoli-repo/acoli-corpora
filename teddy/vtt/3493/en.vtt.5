They are brilliant, mechanical,
utilitarian devices.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:34.727
And that's great, except
for a lot of people, that doesn't work.

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:36.746
People come to our studio all the time,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.702
and they have bubble wrap and duct tape,

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.100
trying to approximate their original form.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:44.738
Or they'll have a gym sock
stuffed with other gym socks

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:47.269
to try to recreate

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:50.130
and that, to us, is not thriving.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:53.491
The body, to us,
is not a mechanical entity,

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.059
where mechanical-only solutions
can address them.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:59.286
It's our personal sculpture,
our kinematic sculpture.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.476
It is our canvas;
