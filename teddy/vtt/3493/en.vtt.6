It is our canvas;

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.456
it represents not just our physicality,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.590
but also a lot of our personality as well.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.545
So when you're designing for the body,

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.048
maybe the thing isn't to design
for mass production,

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.522
but to design with the body in mind,

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.125
to really think about curves
instead of hard geometry,

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.058
or uniqueness instead of identical.

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:19.867
The problem is, we're constrained
by mass production,

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.819
which makes a million identical things

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:24.248
but can't make one unique,
individualized thing.

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:26.901
So we scrapped that
in the new design process,

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.619
and we start with the person.

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.652
