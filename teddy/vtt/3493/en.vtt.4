00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.377
We work with prosthetic limbs,

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:06.141
and the first thing you see
about prosthetic limbs

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:09.357
is that they are engineering brilliance.

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:10.796
They can do amazing things;

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.601
they can return all kinds
of functionality and performance

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.878
back to somebody's life.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.293
But from the vantage
of an industrial designer,

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:19.537
they're not quite there.

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.869
What we don't see is the sculpture
or the beauty or the individual qualities

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.453
or the uniqueness or the elegance to them.

00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:31.321
They are brilliant, mechanical,
utilitarian devices.
