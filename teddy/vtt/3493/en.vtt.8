00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.439
Here, we actually infuse a lot
of the individual's taste and personality

00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:06.091
into it, everywhere we can,

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.420
and we three-dimensionally
print the results.

00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:10.348
We call the resulting parts "fairings,"

00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:13.359
because they're named
after the panels on a motorcycle

00:04:13.383 --> 00:04:16.693
that turn it from a mechanical thing
into a sculptural thing.

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:20.207
We tried this on Chad.

00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.557
Chad is a competitive soccer player,

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:24.485
lost his leg eight years ago to cancer.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.961
You can imagine,
it's really tricky to play soccer

00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:29.931
when you have titanium pipe
where there used to be a leg.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.986
The resulting parts recreated his shape
