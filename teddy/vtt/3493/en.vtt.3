you don't settle for the minimum
functional requirements;

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:34.390
you see how far beyond that you can go,

00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:36.853
where the rewards really are
way out in the fringe

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:39.261
of how far past that document you can go.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.893
And if you can nail that,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.425
you stand to improve
the quality of life for somebody

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:45.646
for every moment
for the rest of their life.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.399
I kind of distilled that down
into a design philosophy,

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:52.738
and infuse that
into the studio that I have now;

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:55.766
I'm trying to get everyone
to think along these lines.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.871
It's not a profound philosophy,
but it works for us.
