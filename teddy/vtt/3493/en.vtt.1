The downside about that is,
there's something impersonal

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:33.764
about lots of identical things,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.741
because when you're trying
to design one thing for one person

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.134
to solve one issue,

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:39.439
you can't really do that

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:42.525
when you're making things
aimed more to a demographic model

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.003
or to a marketing requirements document,

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:46.431
which is what we live by.

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:49.684
So I got disheartened
by the whole process in general,

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:52.941
and went to rethink it
and redesign designing altogether,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.823
went way back to my early, early
design inspirations,

00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:00.113
and back to about eight years old,
and that got me to this guy.
