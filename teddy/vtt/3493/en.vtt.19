00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:30.647
but at the same time,
there's something very valuable.

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.878
He turned to us and said,
"Nobody says that."

00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:34.570
He's never heard that in his life.

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:37.277
That connected with him very deeply.

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.595
So we like to think
that this is a new type of design,

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:44.805
where you're turning
the original process on its head,

00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:48.373
where there is a dialogue that forms
between the designer and the end user,

00:09:48.397 --> 00:09:50.988
where the designer relinquishes
some of the control --

00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:52.352
designers hate doing that --

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:55.749
and instead, is the curator of a process.

00:09:55.773 --> 00:10:00.046
And the end user relinquishes their body
into the process, and their taste.
