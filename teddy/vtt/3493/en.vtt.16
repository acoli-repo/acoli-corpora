00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:02.039
and expressing that through
what would be their body,

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:05.944
whether it's speed or attitude or bling,

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.859
whatever it is that captures
and suggests them in the best way we can.

00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:13.771
Back to the 3D-printing thing
and this whole process:

00:08:13.795 --> 00:08:17.122
we have a process that lends itself
to making one thing per person;

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:20.958
it's very individual, and it actually
really lends itself well to complexity.

00:08:20.982 --> 00:08:22.931
So why not just print the entire leg?

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:26.847
That's the concept that preceded
the work we're doing now.

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:31.047
This is a three-dimensionally printed leg.
It's symmetric to the other leg.
