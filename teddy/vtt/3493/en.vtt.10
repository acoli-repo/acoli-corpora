stopped thinking of him
as the amputee on the team.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.066
Not that they didn't know, but it stopped
becoming a focal point for him.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.295
And there is a certain
very quiet value in that,

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.809
we like to believe.

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.155
James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.886
And the motorcycle is still a big part
of James's personality and style.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.747
Check out the tattoo on his forearm.

00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.641
We three-dimensionally printed that
into what would be his calf.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:26.280
He has his tattoo, he has his morphology

00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:28.618
and he has the materials
of his motorcycle.

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:33.337
And the result is interesting in that
you can't really tell at first glance
