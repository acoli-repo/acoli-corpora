00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.396
because that changes their look.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.685
You don't look at him and say,
"He's an amputee with a prosthetic."

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:06.464
You say, "He's a guy
with something really cool going on.

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:08.184
Deborah wanted her curves back,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:12.254
but she also just wanted
what came out of it to be really sexy,

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:14.648
which is great for us to hear.

00:06:14.672 --> 00:06:18.809
We created this lace pattern
that lends itself well to 3D printing.

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:20.768
We created the first leg, I think,

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:24.485
where the lace defines
the contour of the leg,

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.264
instead of the leg
giving form to the lace.

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.053
We switched things over.

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:32.108
What I like about this shot
is you can see daylight through it.
