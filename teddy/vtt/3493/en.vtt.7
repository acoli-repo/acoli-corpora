This is a three-dimensional scanner,

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.896
and that's what happens
when you scan somebody:

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.435
you get three-dimensional data
into your computer.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.041
You can take the sound-side limb there,
the surviving limb, mirror it over,

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:41.232
and from now on,

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.638
anything in the process
will recreate symmetry --

00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.735
something as personal
and as hard to achieve

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.529
as symmetry in the body.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.036
And you create a product
that, no matter what,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.355
it's going to be as unique
as their fingerprint.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.901
In fact, our process is incapable
of creating two identical things.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.466
So we run it through
computer modeling, 3D CAD.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.439
Here, we actually infuse a lot
of the individual's taste and personality
