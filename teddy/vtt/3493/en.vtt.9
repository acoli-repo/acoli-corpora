00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.986
The resulting parts recreated his shape

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.081
and deliberately had an aesthetic
that look like sporting gear.

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:40.517
We wanted it to make it look like
he just pulled it out of the gym bag,

00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.908
so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:44.112
Two things happened.

00:04:44.136 --> 00:04:48.438
One, we expected: his sense
of his body came back to him.

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:51.312
He was suddenly able to control
the ball, to feel the ball,

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.363
because his body remembered
that original shape that he had had

00:04:54.387 --> 00:04:55.613
up until eight years ago.

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:58.725
The other thing, though,
is that the other members of the team

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.506
stopped thinking of him
as the amputee on the team.
