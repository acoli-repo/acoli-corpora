What I like about this shot
is you can see daylight through it.

00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:33.943
So we're not trying to hide anything;

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:36.486
the load-bearing carbon component
is totally visible.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.204
We're just giving it form
and shape and contours

00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:42.060
that were hers to begin with.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.909
We made her another leg
that matched her purse,

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:47.209
just because we could.

00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:49.168
(Laughter)

00:06:51.108 --> 00:06:53.979
(Applause)

00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:59.360
We made another one
where we laser-tattooed the leather,

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:00.781
because how cool would it be
