I'm an industrial designer,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.728
which means I create all these cool things

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:08.911
from ideas that we surround ourselves
with, or in this case,

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:11.641
geeky people surround themselves
with, for the most part.

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:16.043
I have absolutely no background
in biology, chemistry or engineering,

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:20.254
so bear with me, because I'll be talking
about biomedical engineering today.

00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:21.287
(Laughter)

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:25.483
And please do stay here in the meantime.

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:29.478
Industrial design is about
making lots of things identical.

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.200
The downside about that is,
there's something impersonal
