00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:33.337
And the result is interesting in that
you can't really tell at first glance

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.788
where the motorcycle stops
and where James starts.

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:39.275
It's kind of a chimera hybrid
between the two,

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:41.265
and James likes that.

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.683
(Laughter)

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:48.560
So, we don't ever try to make something
look like it could be human.

00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:51.474
Our whole goal is to be
unapologetically man-made,

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:54.191
to take what's already there, morphology,

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:56.303
and just make it really
cool and beautiful,

00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:58.836
something that somebody
can't wait to show the world,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.396
because that changes their look.
