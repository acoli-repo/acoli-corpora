In fact, they already are.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.618
People are dying of infections again
because of a phenomenon

00:03:35.618 --> 00:03:37.961
called antibiotic resistance.

00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.119
Briefly, it works like this.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:45.091
Bacteria compete against each other
for resources, for food,

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.758
by manufacturing lethal compounds
that they direct against each other.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:52.103
Other bacteria, to protect themselves,

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:55.354
evolve defenses against
that chemical attack.

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:57.676
When we first made antibiotics,

00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.878
we took those compounds into the lab
and made our own versions of them,
