00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.878
we took those compounds into the lab
and made our own versions of them,

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:06.336
and bacteria responded to our attack
the way they always had.

00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:09.898
Here is what happened next:

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:13.488
Penicillin was distributed in 1943,

00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:18.619
and widespread penicillin resistance
arrived by 1945.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.568
Vancomycin arrived in 1972,

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:24.668
vancomycin resistance in 1988.

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:27.150
Imipenem in 1985,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.922
and resistance to in 1998.
