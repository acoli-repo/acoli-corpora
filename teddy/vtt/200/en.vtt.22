the factory farm conditions
they are raised in.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:04.824
In the United States, possibly 80 percent

00:11:04.824 --> 00:11:11.527
of the antibiotics sold every year
go to farm animals, not to humans,

00:11:11.527 --> 00:11:15.203
creating resistant bacteria
that move off the farm

00:11:15.203 --> 00:11:17.827
in water, in dust,

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:20.695
in the meat the animals become.

00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:23.910
Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.559
particularly in Asia,

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.902
and fruit growing relies on antibiotics

00:11:28.902 --> 00:11:33.801
to protect apples, pears,
citrus, against disease.
