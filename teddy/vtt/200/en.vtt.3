00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:31.173
The first test of penicillin,
the first antibiotic,

00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:33.843
was three years in the future.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:38.547
People who got infections
either recovered, if they were lucky,

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:40.042
or they died.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.411
My great uncle was not lucky.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.708
He was in the hospital for a week,
shaking with chills,

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.566
dehydrated and delirious,

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.468
sinking into a coma as his organs failed.

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:52.604
His condition grew so desperate

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:57.234
that the people from his firehouse
lined up to give him transfusions

00:01:57.234 --> 00:02:01.097
hoping to dilute the infection
surging through his blood.
