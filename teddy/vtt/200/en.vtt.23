like a traveler handing off
a suitcase at an airport,

00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:49.360
once we have encouraged
that resistance into existence,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.587
there is no knowing where it will spread.

00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:55.294

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.506

the man who discovered penicillin.
