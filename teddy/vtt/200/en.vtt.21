00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.971
In the United States, 50 percent

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:34.663
of the antibiotics given
in hospitals are unnecessary.

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:39.037
Forty-five percent of the prescriptions
written in doctor's offices

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:43.010
are for conditions
that antibiotics cannot help.

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.247
And that's just in healthcare.

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:52.100
On much of the planet, most meat animals
get antibiotics every day of their lives,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.376
not to cure illnesses,

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:57.835
but to fatten them up
and to protect them against

00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:01.806
the factory farm conditions
they are raised in.
