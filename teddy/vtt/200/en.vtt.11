Today, that infection, known as KPC,

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:37.805
has spread to every state but three,

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:40.150
and to South America, Europe

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.357
and the Middle East.

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.189
In 2008, doctors in Sweden

resistant to all but one drug that time.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.919
The gene that creates that resistance,

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.444
known as NDM, has now spread
from India into China, Asia, Africa,
