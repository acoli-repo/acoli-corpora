I know that the scale
of antibiotic resistance

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.678
seems overwhelming,

00:15:09.678 --> 00:15:13.138
but if you've ever bought
a fluorescent lightbulb

00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:15.854
because you were concerned
about climate change,

00:15:15.854 --> 00:15:18.989
or read the label on a box of crackers

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:23.470
because you think about
the deforestation from palm oil,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.349
you already know what it feels like

00:15:26.349 --> 00:15:31.349
to take a tiny step to address
an overwhelming problem.
