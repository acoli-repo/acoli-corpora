00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.860
Daptomycin, one of
the most recent drugs, in 2003,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.225
and resistance to it
just a year later in 2004.

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:42.335
For 70 years, we played
a game of leapfrog --

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:45.261
our drug and their resistance,

00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.906
and then another drug,
and then resistance again --

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:51.217
and now the game is ending.

00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:55.477
Bacteria develop resistance so quickly
that pharmaceutical companies

00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:59.842
have decided making antibiotics
is not in their best interest,

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:02.652
so there are infections
moving across the world
