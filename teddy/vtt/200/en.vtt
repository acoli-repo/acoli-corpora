This is my great uncle,

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:05.936
my father's father's younger brother.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:07.902
His name was Joe McKenna.

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:13.089
He was a young husband
and a semi-pro basketball player

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.417
and a fireman in New York City.

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:20.007
Family history says
he loved being a fireman,

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.542
and so in 1938, on one of his days off,

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.319
he elected to hang out at the firehouse.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.218
To make himself useful that day,
he started polishing all the brass,
