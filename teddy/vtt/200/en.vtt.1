00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.218
To make himself useful that day,
he started polishing all the brass,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:34.612
the railings on the fire truck,
the fittings on the walls,

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.957
and one of the fire hose nozzles,

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:39.465
a giant, heavy piece of metal,

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:43.074
toppled off a shelf and hit him.

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:47.382
A few days later,
his shoulder started to hurt.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:50.656
Two days after that, he spiked a fever.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:53.141
The fever climbed and climbed.

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.091
His wife was taking care of him,

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:59.393
but nothing she did made a difference,
and when they got the local doctor in,

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.679
nothing he did mattered either.
