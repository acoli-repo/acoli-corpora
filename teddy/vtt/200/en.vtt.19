00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.481
That British project I mentioned
which estimates that the worldwide toll

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:36.358
right now is 700,000 deaths a year

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:42.535
also predicts that if we can't
get this under control by 2050,

00:09:42.535 --> 00:09:50.127
not long, the worldwide toll
will be 10 million deaths a year.

00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:52.829
How did we get to this point

00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:54.864
where what we have to look forward to

00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:58.347
is those terrifying numbers?

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:02.535
The difficult answer is,
we did it to ourselves.
