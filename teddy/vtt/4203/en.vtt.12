00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.869
And of course, my first subject
was the community kitchen in Gurudwaras.

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.472
How this ancient system started
by the Gurus in India,

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:06.279
which has such an ancient identity, 
where everybody shares.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.619
From a farmer to everyone, leaving home,
giving their time, their hearts,

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.280
so that nobody sleeps hungry at night.
I wrote about it.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.519
(Applause)

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.919
There was a white man with me.
He said, "Sir, what are you writing?"

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.919
I said, "I am writing this 'Holy Kitchens.'"

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.420
He said, "Whatever you write,
you'll always be ten times less than me."

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.069
I said, "Ten times less?
Is it because of my English?"
