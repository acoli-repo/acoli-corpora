00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.130
but I never said they hurt.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.799
I once put an iron on my feet
hoping to straighten them by ironing them,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.629
so that I could be like everyone else.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.750
But I was not meant
to be like everyone else,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.664
Mom used to say,
"You are meant to be different."

00:02:12.744 --> 00:02:15.800
(Applause)

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.879
All doors were shut for me;
the only one open led to the kitchen.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.357
We had a little kitchen at home,

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.839
and my grandmother was a very good cook.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.559
Elders had large hearts, 
large utensils for cooking, big kitchens.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.239
That generation was truly something else.
