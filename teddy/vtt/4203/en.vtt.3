00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.800
When people made fun of me, 


00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.600
my mom said, "No, he is not 
born to wal;, he is born to fly."

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.040
(Applause)

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.719
Children who are different are treated
differently at school as well.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719
Totally different.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.079
Other children would say
I was polio-stricken

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.639
or that I was a ghost
because I had twisted feet.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.379
I often heard people say I was cursed.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.579
I had to wear huge wooden shoes, braces,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.130
but I never said they hurt.
