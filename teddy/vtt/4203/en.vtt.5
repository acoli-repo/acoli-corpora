00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.239
That generation was truly something else.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.479
That is where I learned cooking --

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.459
by being her helper because there
was very little I could do otherwise.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.879
What gave me immense happiness was
going to the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.679
Children would be
rolling bread, shelling peas,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.159
washing utensils and doing service.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.410
Over there, I did not
hear any scornful voices,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.430
I could hear only one thing --
my own voice.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.800
(Applause)

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.759
One thing I learned at the Golden
Temple was to be thankful to everyone.
