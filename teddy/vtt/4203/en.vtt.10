00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.079
And on August 23, 2004,
I cooked food at the James Beard House.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.879
James Beard is like
the Oscars for food in America.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.380
An Indian saying came to mind, 


00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.090
"One who has the support of the Lord 
can be harmed by none." I reached there.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.720
When I was called on stage ...

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.720
(Applause)

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.959
When I was called on stage,
everyone stood up and applauded for me,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.484
they said that they had
never seen such Indian food.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:29.599
The food had a new look, a new identity;
it was fresh, from the heart.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.499
It was a significant moment in my life.
I felt like I was alive again.
