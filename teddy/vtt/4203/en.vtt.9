he wanted to break me.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360
I walked out but I swore that day
that I will achieve something one day.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.230
(Applause)

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.239
He was my conductor, he was my 1893.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.279
Everybody comes across such a day in life.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.199
Only the names change, 
situations change, faces change.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.039
I worked with a lot of chefs
including Gordon Ramsey.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.759
I learned English, did everything,
worked very hard.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.079
And on August 23, 2004,
I cooked food at the James Beard House.
