00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.499
It was a significant moment in my life.
I felt like I was alive again.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920
I quit my job,

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:41.599
I decided my main aim should be to take
Indian food and culture ahead in America.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.879
So there in a small university, actually
it was quite big, I went to do research.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.639
My project was on religion and food.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.887
This later became 
the "Holy Kitchens" documentary series,

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:57.460
which was shown at the White House,
at Oxford, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.869
And of course, my first subject
was the community kitchen in Gurudwaras.
