In 2003,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.333
when we sequenced the human genome,

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:10.279
we thought we would have the answer
to treat many diseases.

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:13.631
But the reality is far from that,

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:16.703
because in addition to our genes,

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:21.297
our environment and lifestyle
could have a significant role

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.869
in developing many major diseases.

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:27.473
One example is fatty liver disease,

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:31.580
which is affecting over 20 percent
of the population globally,
