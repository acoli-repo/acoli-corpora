You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.704
We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.830
because they get ticketed by a camera

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.343
if they use that lane,

00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:40.985
and it's been a huge success.

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:43.025
I think one of my very favorite moments

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:45.311
as transportation commissioner was the day

00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:46.808
that we launched Citi Bike,

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.858
and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue

00:12:49.858 --> 00:12:51.218
in my protected bike lane,

00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:53.594
and I looked over and I saw pedestrians

00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:56.222
standing safely on the pedestrian islands,

00:12:56.222 --> 00:12:58.586
and the traffic was flowing,

00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:00.536
birds were singing --
