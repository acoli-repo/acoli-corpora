00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:02.938
of the program, because we were able to show

00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:04.307
how it worked.

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:07.286
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.122
So it was all about the data.

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.295
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.648
if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:17.379
and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.269
we could put it back the way that it was,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.530
because these were temporary materials.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.439
And that was a very big part of the buy-in,

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.582
much less anxiety when you think that something

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.453
can be put back.

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:29.607
But the results were overwhelming.

00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:32.527
Traffic moved better. It was much safer.
