00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:31.295
And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.444
We've moved very, very quickly

00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:35.693
with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:36.950
Instead of waiting

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.773
through years of planning studies

00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:42.151
and computer models to get something done,

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:44.886
we've done it with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.236
And the proof is not in a computer model.

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:50.201
It is in the real-world performance of the street.

00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.197
You can have fun with paint.

00:07:53.197 --> 00:07:57.430
All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.205
in all five boroughs across the city.
