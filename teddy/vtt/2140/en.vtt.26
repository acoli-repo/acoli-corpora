00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:00.536
birds were singing --

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.891
(Laughter) --

00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.977
the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:08.675
It was just fantastic.

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:11.546
And this is how it looked six years ago.

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:14.990
And so, I think that the lesson that we have

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.469
from New York is that it's possible

00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:21.177
to change your streets quickly,

00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:25.171
it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.525
and it can be quite popular.

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:30.804
You just need to reimagine your streets.
