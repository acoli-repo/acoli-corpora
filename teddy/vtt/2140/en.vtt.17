00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.633
that we had on the streets.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.743
But I can't underscore enough

00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:35.320
how much more quickly this enables you to move

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.442
over traditional construction methods.

00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:40.602
We also brought this quick-acting approach

00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.150
to our cycling program,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.666
and in six years turned cycling

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:47.905
into a real transportation option in New York.

00:08:47.905 --> 00:08:49.602
I think it's fair to say --

00:08:49.602 --> 00:08:54.841
(Applause) --

00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:58.305
it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,

00:08:58.305 --> 00:08:59.863
and now New York has become

00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:03.908
one of the cycling capitals in the United States.
