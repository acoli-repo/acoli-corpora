00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:34.472
because they understood that more people on foot

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:36.453
is better for business.

00:06:36.453 --> 00:06:39.123
And we've done these projects all across the city

00:06:39.123 --> 00:06:40.735
in all kinds of neighborhoods.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.861
This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.953
and you can see the short leg that was there,

00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:47.203
used for cars, that's not really needed.

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:50.792
So what we did is we painted over the street,

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:54.123
put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:56.118
to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.116
created a great new public space,

00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:00.130
and it's been great for businesses
