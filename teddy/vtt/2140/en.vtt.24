00:11:57.291 --> 00:12:00.309
women, kids, all getting on a bike.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:03.326
It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.

00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:05.416
Quite radical.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.558
We've also brought this approach to our buses,

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:11.995
and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.436
the slowest bus speeds.

00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:14.515
As everybody knows,

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:16.917
you can walk across town faster

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:18.137
than you can take the bus.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.939
And so we focused on the most congested areas

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:22.364
of New York City,

00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:25.295
built out six bus rapid transit lines,

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:28.588
57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.

00:12:28.588 --> 00:12:31.318
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.
