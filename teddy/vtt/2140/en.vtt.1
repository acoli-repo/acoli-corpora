it can provide immediate benefits,

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:34.337
and it can be quite popular.

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.829
You just need to look at them a little differently.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.577
This is important because we live in an urban age.

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.656
For the first time in history,

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.421
most people live in cities,

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.984
and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:52.885
the population is going to double on the planet.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.328
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:58.913
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:02.152
when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.
