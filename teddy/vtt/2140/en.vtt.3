00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.862
This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:34.841
and despite all of the technological innovation,

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:37.290
cultural changes, political changes,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.545
this is Times Square in 2008.

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:43.918
Not much has changed in those 50 years.

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:46.981
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.596
to maximize efficient mobility,

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.177
providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:56.236
more room for people to enjoy the city,

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:58.471
and to make our streets as safe as they can be

00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.579
for everybody that uses them.
