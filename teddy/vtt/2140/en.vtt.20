00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.412
And the yellow line is the number of injuries,

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:04.897
which has remained essentially flat.

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.765
After this big expansion, you've seen

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.615
no net increase in injuries,

00:10:09.615 --> 00:10:12.271
and so there is something to that axiom

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.518
that there is safety in numbers.

00:10:15.518 --> 00:10:18.650
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.922
and there was a lawsuit and somewhat

00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:23.894
of a media frenzy a couple years ago.

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:26.141
One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:28.595
that we have on Prospect Park West

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.483
"the most contested piece of land
