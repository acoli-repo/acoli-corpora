00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.435
It's not great for parents with kids.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:04.671
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.712
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.

00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:10.764
Certainly not good for the police department.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.773
So we worked hard to change that balance,

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:17.108
and probably the best example of our new approach

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:18.743
is in Times Square.

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:22.573
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:24.283
walk through Times Square,

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:26.773
and people had tried for years to make changes.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.161
They changed signals, they changed lanes,

00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:32.064
everything they could do to make Times Square work better.
