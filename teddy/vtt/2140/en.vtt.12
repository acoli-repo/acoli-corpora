to reflect the light from the billboards,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.653
creating a great new energy on the street,

00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:05.770
and we think it's going to really create

who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,

take care of the plants.

00:06:25.492 --> 00:06:27.511
This is in front of Macy's, and they were

00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:29.625
a big supporter of this new approach,

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:34.472
because they understood that more people on foot
