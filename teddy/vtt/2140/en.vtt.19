00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.754
We created the first parking-protected bike lane

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:33.326
in the United States.

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.853
(Applause)

00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:38.124
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,

00:09:38.124 --> 00:09:39.637
and it's been great.

00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:41.364
Bike volumes have spiked.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:43.998
Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,

00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:45.789
are all down 50 percent.

00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:49.052
And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,

00:09:49.052 --> 00:09:50.591
and now you're seeing them pop up

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.460
all over the country.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.317
And you can see here that this strategy has worked.

00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:56.969
The blue line is the number of cyclists,

00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:57.973
soaring.

00:09:57.973 --> 00:09:59.916
The green line is the number of bike lanes.

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.412
And the yellow line is the number of injuries,
