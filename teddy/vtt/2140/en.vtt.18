00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:03.908
one of the cycling capitals in the United States.

00:09:03.908 --> 00:09:07.904
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected

00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:10.339
network of lanes.

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.700
You can see the map in 2007.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.894
This is how it looked in 2013

00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:19.490
after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.507
I love this because it looks so easy.

00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:25.406
You just click it, and they're there.

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:28.417
We also brought new designs to the street.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.754
We created the first parking-protected bike lane
