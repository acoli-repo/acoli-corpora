00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:01.226
was how quickly people flocked to the space.

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:03.284
We put out the orange barrels,

00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:06.892
and people just materialized immediately into the street.

00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:08.933
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.262
They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:12.640
All the people arrived.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.398
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.542
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:22.058
because the street furniture had not yet arrived.

00:05:22.058 --> 00:05:24.680
So we went to a hardware store

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.027
and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:30.219
and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.
