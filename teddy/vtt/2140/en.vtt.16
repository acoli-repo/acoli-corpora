00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.205
in all five boroughs across the city.

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:05.011
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:09.007
and turned them into new pedestrian space.

00:08:09.007 --> 00:08:12.448
I think one of the successes is in its emulation.

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:13.989
You're seeing this kind of approach,

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:15.544
since we've painted Times Square,

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:18.574
you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,

00:08:18.574 --> 00:08:21.073
in San Francisco, in Mexico City,

00:08:21.073 --> 00:08:22.636
Buenos Aires, you name it.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.985
This is actually in Los Angeles,

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:28.608
and they actually copied even the green dots

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.633
that we had on the streets.
