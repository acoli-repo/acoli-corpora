Traffic moved better. It was much safer.

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.934
Five new flagship stores opened.

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:36.807
It's been a total home run.

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.390
Times Square is now one of the top 10

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.021
retail locations on the planet.

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:44.455
And this is an important lesson,

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:47.553
because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:52.078
between moving traffic and creating public space.

00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.893
Every project has its surprises,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.546
and one of the big surprises with Times Square

00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:01.226
was how quickly people flocked to the space.
