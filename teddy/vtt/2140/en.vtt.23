00:11:29.703 --> 00:11:32.735
The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:36.624
Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:38.586
The bikes are being used six times a day.

00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:41.367
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.722
that are on the streets.

00:11:42.722 --> 00:11:45.096
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,

00:11:45.096 --> 00:11:48.101
ninja-clad bike messenger.

00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:51.938
And today, cyclists look

00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:54.109
like New York City looks.

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:57.291
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,

00:11:57.291 --> 00:12:00.309
women, kids, all getting on a bike.
