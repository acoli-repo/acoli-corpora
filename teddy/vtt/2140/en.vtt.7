00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:32.064
everything they could do to make Times Square work better.

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:34.986
It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.707
It was chaotic.

00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:39.489
And so, none of those approaches worked,

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.538
so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,

00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:43.207
looked at our street differently.

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:46.780
And so we did a six-month pilot.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.036
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:53.570
and created two and a half acres

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.346
of new pedestrian space.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.513
And the temporary materials are an important part

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:02.938
of the program, because we were able to show
