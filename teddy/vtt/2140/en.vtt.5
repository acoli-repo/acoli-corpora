00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.461
The design of this street is really

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.121
to maximize the movement of cars

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:34.849
moving as quickly as possible

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.672
from point A to point B,

00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:38.564
and it misses all the other ways

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:40.991
that a street is used.

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:43.942
When we started out, we did some early surveys

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:45.987
about how our streets were used,

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:47.983
and we found that New York City was largely

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.114
a city without seats.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:52.498
Pictures like this, people perched

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:56.671
on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.959
(Laughter)

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.435
It's not great for parents with kids.
