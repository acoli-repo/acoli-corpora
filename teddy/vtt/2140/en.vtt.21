00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.483
"the most contested piece of land

00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:32.455
outside of the Gaza Strip."

00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:35.834
(Laughter)

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.754
And this is what we had done.

00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:42.760
So if you dig below the headlines, though,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.653
you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:47.901
far ahead of the politicians.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:50.089
In fact, I think most politicians would be happy

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:52.240
to have those kind of poll numbers.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.318
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:57.297
This summer, we launched Citi Bike,

00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:59.880
the largest bike share program in the United States,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.764
with 6,000 bikes
