00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.211
As a little girl, I always imagined

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.546
I would one day run away.

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:07.010
From the age of six on,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.462
I kept a packed bag with some clothes

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:10.988
and cans of food tucked away

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:12.982
in the back of a closet.

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.604
There was a deep restlessness in me,

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:18.150
a primal fear that I would fall prey

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.925
to a life of routine and boredom.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.534
And so, many of my early memories involved

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:27.100
intricate daydreams where
I would walk across borders,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.468
forage for berries,

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:30.532
and meet all kinds of strange people
