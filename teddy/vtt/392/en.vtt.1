and that evil is apathy.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:36.268
So, we know that apathy
really costs us a lot,

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.726
especially in our democracy.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.184
And when we think of why
people do not get involved,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.476
why they do not become activists,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.184
it's often that people are so worn down
with their own familial responsibilities,

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.476
and women especially.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.059
You know, women,
they have so many inhibitions.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.476
Many of them have suffered
so much trauma in their lives,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.726
so many aggressions in their lives.
