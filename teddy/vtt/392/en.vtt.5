00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:32.184
The other thing that we have to do
to liberate our women, eventually,

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:35.518
so that we can do the kind
of volunteer work that we need to do

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.059
to change this world,

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:41.559
is we have to have a different kind
of an education for our young women.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:45.059
Unfortunately, in our societies
around the world,

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.375
women are taught to be victims.

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:52.018
Women are not taught that they
are going to have to defend themselves,

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:54.351
that they're going to have
to support themselves

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.268
and they have to protect themselves.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.245
Because, you know, when we
actually look at the animal kingdom,

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.643
and we see who are the most ferocious,
the male or the female?
