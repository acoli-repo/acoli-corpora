Now, we think, if a poor country like Cuba

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:05.351
can have these kind of resources,
and we know that they're a poor country,

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:07.934
then why can't some
of the other wealthier countries,

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.601
like the United States of America,

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:10.893
do the same?

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:12.726
I think that we can make that happen.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.143
(Applause)

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:17.934
But we know it's not going to happen

00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.768
until we, the people
of the United States of America,

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.351
and people throughout the world,

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:28.226
start making sure that they get public
officials elected to their governments

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.143
that really care about the constituents,
they care about people,
