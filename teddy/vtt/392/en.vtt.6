00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.643
and we see who are the most ferocious,
the male or the female?

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.601
We know it's the female, right?

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:10.226
So something went wrong with us at the top
of that animal kingdom as women.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.893
(Laughter)

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:15.268
So I want to give you an example
of how I found my voice.

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:18.851
And I was very fortunate in that,
when I was 25 years old,

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.268
I met a gentleman named Fred Ross Sr.,

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:26.143
who organized a chapter of a group called
the Community Service Organization

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:29.018
in my hometown of Stockton, California.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:33.292
This was a grassroots organization,
and I was recruited to be a volunteer.
