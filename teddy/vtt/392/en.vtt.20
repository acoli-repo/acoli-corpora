00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:03.851
How many jillions of bananas do we consume
in the United States every single day?

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.643
And throughout the world.

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:07.768
Now, do the people in Central America

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:11.018
get the profits from the bananas
that we consume?

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:12.434
No, they don't.

00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:17.226
The profits go to corporations
from the United States of America.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.059
And we think that this is wrong.

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:24.184
Now, if the people in Central America
were to be able to get some of that money

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.851
that we pay for bananas,

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.976
then they wouldn't have
to leave their homes.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.601
They wouldn't have to come
as asylum seekers
