00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.684
They had the Women's Marches
all over the world.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:34.309
And so we now see
that we have this potential.

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:36.643
We have this potential
to get rid of the apathy.

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:40.351
And if we get everyone involved,
get everyone committed,

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:44.101
then, I think, we can make
Coretta Scott's vision come true.

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:46.768
So, I want to just remind everybody,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:49.601
throughout the world,
one of the things is,

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:51.393
we have power,

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:53.059
poor people have power,

00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:54.809
every citizen has power.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:59.934
But in order to achieve
the peace that we all yearn for,

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.726
then we've all got to get involved.
