00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:31.184
I went down to the welfare office
and I demanded to see the supervisor.

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.434
Sure enough, he came out,

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.809
and they had to let Mr. Ruiz
make an application for welfare.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.309
And he got his disability
for himself and his family.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.018
But that taught me a lesson.

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:44.601
That taught me that I had a voice.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:48.934
Well, Mr. Ross also taught many of us
many other things, including Cesar Chavez

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.809
and many other volunteers.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:54.351
And he taught us not only
that we can make demands of people,

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.934
especially our public officials.

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.393
And this is something
we should always keep in mind:

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:03.559
every public official --
guess what -- they work for us.
