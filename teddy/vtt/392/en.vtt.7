WEBVTT

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:33.292
This was a grassroots organization,
and I was recruited to be a volunteer.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.434
So, one day, while we were
sitting in the office,

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.476
a farm worker comes in.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.518
And he's paralyzed,
he can hardly walk, he has a crutch.

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:44.851
And he needs help.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.601
He needs someone to help him
go down to the welfare office

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:48.934
and make an application.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.143
So, I volunteered to do that.

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.684
But when I got to the welfare office,

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:58.143
they would not let me make
an application for this gentleman.

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:01.018
So I didn't know what to do,
I was at a loss.
