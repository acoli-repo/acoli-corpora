00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:01.018
So I didn't know what to do,
I was at a loss.

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:03.851
So I went back to the office,
and I told Mr. Ross,

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:06.393
"They won't let me make an application."

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.934
And he said to me, very sternly,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.476
"You go right back down
to that welfare office,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.875
and you demand to see a supervisor.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.916
And you demand that they
let him make an application."

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.976
And I thought, "Wow, I can do that?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.059
(Laughter)

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:24.351
So I thought about it,

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:27.351
and I kind of overcame
my anxieties and my fears.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:31.184
I went down to the welfare office
and I demanded to see the supervisor.
