00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:30.893
Phone banking, talking to voters,

00:05:30.917 --> 00:05:34.434
because many voters have a lot of doubts
and they don't know how to vote.

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:35.726
And unfortunately,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.809
we know that in many countries
people are not allowed to vote

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.601
because we have voter suppression
in other countries,

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:43.893
like we do here
in the United States of America.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:46.559
But the thing is, if we can
get out there as individuals

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:50.101
and talk to people,
so we can remove their apathy

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:52.393
and make sure that they can vote.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:56.559
So, I want to give you an example
of a woman in our foundation,

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.184
the Dolores Huerta Foundation,

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:01.851
and just to show you
that sometimes people have power,
