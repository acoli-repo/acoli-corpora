"Get rid of the apathy,
get off of the sidewalk,

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.518
come and join the march
for peace and justice,

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:06.393
let's make Coretta Scott's
vision a reality,

00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:08.018
to have peace in the world."

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.518
We recently had midterm elections
in the United States of America.

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.143
And what did we see?

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:15.726
We saw that so many more women,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.851
young people, people of color, LGBT folks,

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.809
were all elected to public office.

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:22.768
And we know this happened -- why?

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:25.684
Because so many women were on the march.

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:28.309
We had the Women's March
in the United States.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.684
They had the Women's Marches
all over the world.
