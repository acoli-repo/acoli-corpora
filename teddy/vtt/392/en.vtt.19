00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:31.518
so that they can rebuild their economies
and rebuild their corporations.

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:33.208
And we can do that again.

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:37.101
And if we can think about how
we can help these other countries.

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.559
And I want to give an example

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:41.476
of issues that we are facing
in the United States of America,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.768
for instance.

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:44.101
We know that right now

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.768
we have a lot of refugees
from Central America

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:49.143
that are at the border
of the United States.

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.684
Why do people leave their homes,

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:54.143
their beautiful homes
that we go to as tourists?

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:56.351
Because they don't have
opportunities there.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:59.559
And then we think, "Hm, bananas."

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:03.851
How many jillions of bananas do we consume
in the United States every single day?
