00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:30.476
because the air quality is so bad

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.059
in the southern part
of Kern County, California

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.101
in our United States of America.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:39.893
So she and her husband went out there,
and they passed a bond issue

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:43.309
to build a brand new,
state-of-the-art gymnasium

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.417
for the kids at their middle school.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.476
That was a big success.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.101
Then she heard a rumor

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:53.518
that the principal was going to end
the breakfast program

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.018
for the farm worker children,

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:58.768
because the principal thought
it was just too much paperwork.

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:02.143
So, Leticia got herself elected
to the school board.
