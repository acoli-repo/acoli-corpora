00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to start out
with quoting Helen Keller,

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:09.643
that great woman that we all admire.

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:13.250
And she had a statement
that is very profound,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.393
and this statement is

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:22.476
that science has been able to find
cures for many evils,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.476
but never the greatest evil
of all in human beings,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.208
and that evil is apathy.
