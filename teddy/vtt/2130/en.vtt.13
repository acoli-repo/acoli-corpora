00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:33.125
How to distribute it between pedestrians,

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.227
bicycles, public transport and cars?

00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:39.018
This is not a technological issue,

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:42.542
and we should remember that in no constitution

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.863
parking is a constitutional right

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.364
when we make that distribution.

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:50.995
We also built, and this was 15 years ago,

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.933
before there were bikeways in New York

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:54.377
or in Paris or in London,

00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:56.824
it was a very difficult battle as well,

00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:01.644
more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.
