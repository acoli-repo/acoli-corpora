00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:33.477
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:35.182
who is barely learning to speak

00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:36.693
in any city in the world today,

00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:38.375
"Watch out, a car,"

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.937
the child will jump in fright,

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.716
and with a very good reason, because there are

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:45.273
more than 10,000 children who are killed

00:08:45.273 --> 00:08:48.742
by cars every year in the world.

00:08:48.742 --> 00:08:51.350
We have had cities for 8,000 years,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.686
and children could walk out of home and play.

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:57.978
In fact, only very recently,

00:08:57.978 --> 00:08:59.812
towards 1900, there were no cars.

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:03.813
Cars have been here for really
less than 100 years.
