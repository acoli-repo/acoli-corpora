00:11:59.562 --> 00:12:04.210
But unfortunately, reality is not as good

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.962
as my dreams.

00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:09.144
Because of private property of land

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:12.165
and high land prices,

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:15.202
all developing country cities
have a large problem of slums.

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:18.112
In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:23.458
in cities initially were illegal developments.

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:26.670
And of course it's very difficult to have

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.626
mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.
