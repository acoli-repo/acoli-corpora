00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:03.378
Mobility in developing world cities

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.536
is a very peculiar challenge,

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:07.341
because different from health

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.651
or education or housing,

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.085

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:15.869
Clearly, a unsustainable model.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.196
Mobility, as most other developing country problems,

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:24.101
more than a matter of money or technology,

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:29.492

The great inequality in developing countries
