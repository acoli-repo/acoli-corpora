00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.601
The great inequality in developing countries

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.026
makes it difficult to see, for example,

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:38.590
that in terms of transport,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.520
an advanced city is not one

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.542
where even the poor use cars,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.565
but rather one where even the rich

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.789
use public transport.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.355
Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:52.385
more than 30 percent of the population

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.920
uses bicycles,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.818
despite the fact that the Netherlands has

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:59.801
a higher income per capita than the United States.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.658
There is a conflict in developing world cities
