00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:03.813
Cars have been here for really
less than 100 years.

00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:06.587
They completely changed cities.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.535
In 1900, for example,

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:12.421
nobody was killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.336
Only 20 years later,

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:17.731
between 1920 and 1930,

00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.089
almost 200,000 people

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:22.599
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:26.630
Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.582
were killed by cars in the United States.
