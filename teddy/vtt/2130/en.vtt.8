00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:00.309
In fact, buses are not sexy,

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.456
but they are the only possible means

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:06.739
to bring mass transit to all areas

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.414
of fast growing developing cities.

00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:12.589
They also have great capacity.

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.333
For example, this system in Guangzhou

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.038
is moving more passengers our direction

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:20.862
than all subway lines in China,

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:23.353
except for one line in Beijing,

00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:25.690
at a fraction of the cost.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.804
We fought not just for space for buses,

00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:32.860
but we fought for space for people,
