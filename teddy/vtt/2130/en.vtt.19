00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.582
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:30.582 --> 00:09:34.585
So we could make different cities,

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:37.346
cities that will give more priority to human beings

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:39.805
than to cars, that will give more public space

00:09:39.805 --> 00:09:41.929
to human beings than to cars,

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:44.684
cities which show great respect

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.845
for those most vulnerable citizens,

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.629
such as children or the elderly.

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:52.434
I will propose to you a couple of ingredients

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:55.776
which I think would make cities much better,

00:09:55.776 --> 00:09:58.261
and it would be very simple to implement them

00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:01.185
in the new cities which are only being created.
