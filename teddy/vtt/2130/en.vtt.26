00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.911
Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950

00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:10.984
to 80 percent urban in 2010 --

00:13:10.984 --> 00:13:14.144
I would recommend Asian and African countries

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:15.926
which are yet to urbanize,

00:13:15.926 --> 00:13:20.093
such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,

00:13:20.093 --> 00:13:23.068
that governments should acquire
all land around cities.

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.589
In this way, their cities could grow in the right places

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:27.364
with the right spaces, with the parks,

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:30.740
with the greenways, with the busways.
