00:04:57.454 --> 00:05:00.385
Here, what you see is a picture that shows

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:02.037
insufficient democracy.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.129
What this shows is that people who walk

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.804
are third-class citizens

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:08.139
while those who go in cars

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.954
are first-class citizens.

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:12.361
In terms of transport infrastructure,

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.564
what really makes a difference

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.110
between advanced and backward cities

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.202
is not highways or subways

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:20.466
but quality sidewalks.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:23.232
Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:27.190
and they forgot to make a sidewalk.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.514
This is prevailing all over the world.

00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:33.299
Not even schoolchildren
are more important than cars.
