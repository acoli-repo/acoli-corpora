00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.253
However, there is a problem with that,

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:34.921
that market economy needs

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.639
inequality of income in order to work.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.181
Some people must make more money,

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.732
some others less.

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:43.301
Some companies succeed. Others fail.

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.175
Then what kind of equality

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.780
can we hope for today

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.702
with a market economy?

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.638
I would propose two kinds

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:52.992
which both have much to do with cities.

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:56.098
The first one is equality of quality of life,

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.886
especially for children,

00:01:57.886 --> 00:01:59.541
that all children should have,

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.548
beyond the obvious health and education,
