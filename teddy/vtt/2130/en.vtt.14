00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:01.644
more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:03.568
I don't think protected bicycle ways

00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.322
are a cute architectural feature.

00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:09.028
They are a right, just as sidewalks are,

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.226
unless we believe that only those

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.560
with access to a motor vehicle

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.627
have a right to safe mobility,

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:17.900
without the risk of getting killed.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.567
And just as busways are,

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.658
protected bikeways also are

00:07:23.658 --> 00:07:25.537
a powerful symbol of democracy,

00:07:25.537 --> 00:07:29.187
because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:31.609
is equally important
