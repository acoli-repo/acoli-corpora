00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:31.609
is equally important

00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:35.551
to one in a $30,000 car.

00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:39.268
And we are living in a unique moment in history.

00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:43.720
In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.282
which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:50.580
In many developing country cities,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.640
more than 80 and 90 percent

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.342
of the city which will exist in 2060

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.703
will be built over the next four or five decades.

00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:02.825
But this is not just a matter
for developing country cities.
