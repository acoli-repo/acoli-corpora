00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:01.940
and the cars still in the mud.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.763
Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.211
But what do we do first?

00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:09.372
Ninety-nine percent of the people
in those neighborhoods don't have cars.

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.845
But you see, when a city is only being created,

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:13.935
it's very easy to incorporate

00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:16.111
this kind of infrastructure.

00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:18.809
Then the city grows around it.

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:21.852
And of course this is just a glimpse

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:24.647
of something which could be much better

00:11:24.647 --> 00:11:26.365
if we just create it,

00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:28.702
and it changes the way of life.

00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:32.768
And the second ingredient,
which would solve mobility,
