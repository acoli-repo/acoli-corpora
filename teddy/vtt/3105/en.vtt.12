00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.496
there was already a movement
that was large and broad enough

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.336
to, for instance, stage strikes
that didn't just shut down factories,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.440
but shut down entire cities.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.696
The big policy wins of the New Deal
were actually offered as compromises.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.120
Because the alternative
seemed to be revolution.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.840
So, let's adjust
that equation from earlier.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.216
A shocking event plus utopian imagination

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.856
plus movement muscle,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.280
that's how we get a real leap.
