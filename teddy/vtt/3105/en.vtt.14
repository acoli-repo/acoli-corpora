00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.096
Where climate activists
used to talk about changing light bulbs,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.816
now we're pushing
for 100 percent of our energy

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.016
to come from the sun, wind and waves,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.720
and to do it fast.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.176
Movements catalyzed
by police violence against black bodies

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.016
are calling for an end
to militarized police, mass incarceration

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.600
and even for reparations for slavery.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.816
Students are not just
opposing tuition increases,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.056
but from Chile to Canada to the UK,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.720
they are calling for free tuition
and debt cancellation.
