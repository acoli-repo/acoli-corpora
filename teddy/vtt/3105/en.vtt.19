in prisons, in schools and on the streets,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.840
these connections are too rarely made.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.496
The walls between our silos

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.376
also means that our solutions,
when they emerge,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.696
are also disconnected from each other.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.696
So progressives now have this long list
of demands that I was mentioning earlier,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.336
those "yeses."

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.736
But what we're still missing

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.136
is that coherent picture
of the world we're fighting for.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.960
What it looks like, what it feels like,
and most of all, what its core values are.
