00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.216
There's a question I've been
puzzling over and writing about

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.320
for pretty much all of my adult life.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.416
Why do some large-scale crises

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.175
jolt us awake and inspire us
to change and evolve

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.096
while others might jolt us a bit,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.120
but then it's back to sleep?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.016
Now, the kind of shocks
I'm talking about are big --

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.616
a cataclysmic market crash,
rising fascism,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.080
an industrial accident
that poisons on a massive scale.
