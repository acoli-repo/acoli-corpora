00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.456
is the same quest for bottomless
profits and endless growth

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.816
that is at the heart
of our ecological crisis

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.416
and is destabilizing our planet.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.120
It also became clear what we need to do.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.136
We need to create
a culture of care-taking.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.456
In which no one
and nowhere is thrown away.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.440
In which the inherent value of all people
and every ecosystem is foundational.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.136
So we came up with this people's platform,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.616
and don't worry, I'm not going to read
the whole thing to you out loud --

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.656
if you're interested,
you can read it at theleap.org.
