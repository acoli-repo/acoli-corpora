00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.016
and that produced a leap to a safer place.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.136
Now, if that's really what it took,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.976
then why isn't it working anymore?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.456
Why do today's non-stop shocks --

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.456
why don't they spur us into action?

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.176
Why don't they produce leaps?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.760
Especially when it comes
to climate change.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.495
So I want to talk to you today

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.296
about what I think is a much more
complete recipe for deep transformation

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.456
catalyzed by shocking events.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.016
And I'm going to focus
on two key ingredients

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.960
that usually get left out
of the history books.
