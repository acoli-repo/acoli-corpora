There were faith leaders
and feminist icons and many more.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.896
And we gave ourselves
a pretty ambitious assignment:

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.040
agreeing on a short statement
describing the world after we win.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.496
The world after we've already
made the transition to a clean economy

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.776
and a much fairer society.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.016
In other words,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.736
instead of trying to scare people
about what will happen if we don't act,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.736
we decided to try to inspire them
with what could happen if we did act.
