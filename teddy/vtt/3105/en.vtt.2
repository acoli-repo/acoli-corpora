Faced with a crisis,
we often fall apart, regress

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.456
and that becomes a window
for antidemocratic forces

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.480
to push societies backwards,
to become more unequal and more unstable.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.056
Ten years ago, I wrote
about this backwards process

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.850
and I called it the "Shock Doctrine."

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.256
So what determines which road
we navigate through crisis?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.656
Whether we grow up fast
and find those strengths

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.520
or whether we get knocked back.
