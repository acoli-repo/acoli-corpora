and against a backdrop
of a lot of painful history

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.416
was not easy work.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.296
But it was also pretty thrilling.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.976
Because as soon as we gave ourselves
permission to dream,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.336
those threads connecting
much of our work became self-evident.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.776
We realized, for instance,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.376
that the bottomless quest for profits

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.656
that is forcing so many people
to work more than 50 hours a week,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.176
without security,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.776
and that is fueling
this epidemic of despair

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.456
is the same quest for bottomless
profits and endless growth
