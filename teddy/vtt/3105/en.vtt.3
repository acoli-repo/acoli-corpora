Record-breaking storms, drowning cities,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.576
record-breaking fires
threatening to devour them,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.680
thousands of migrants
disappearing beneath the waves.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.536
And openly supremacist movements rising,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.520

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.880
And now there's no shortage
of people who are sounding the alarm.
