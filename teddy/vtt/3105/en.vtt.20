00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.456
And that really matters.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.296
Because when large-scale crises hit us

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.736
and we are confronted with the need
to leap somewhere safer,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.736
there isn't any agreement
on what that place is.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.496
And leaping without a destination

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.176
looks a lot like jumping up and down.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.416
(Laughter)

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.016
Fortunately, there are all kinds
of conversations and experiments going on

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.296
to try to overcome these divisions
that are holding us back.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.120
And I want to finish
by talking about one of them.
