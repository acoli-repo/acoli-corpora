00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.120
And I want to finish
by talking about one of them.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.176
A couple of years ago,
a group of us in Canada

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.416
decided that we were hitting the limits

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.480
of what we could accomplish
in our various silos.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.656
So we locked ourselves
in a room for two days,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.136
and we tried to figure out
what bound us together.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.016
In that room were people
who rarely get face to face.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.616
There were indigenous elders
with hipsters working on transit.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.456
There was the head of Greenpeace

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.536
with a union leader
representing oil workers and loggers.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.560
There were faith leaders
and feminist icons and many more.
