00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.416
along with the transformation
of allied nations and economies

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.576
during the World War II effort,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.856
show us that it is possible
for complex societies

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.560
to rapidly transform themselves
in the face of a collective threat.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.136
Now, when we tell this story
of the 1929 Crash,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.416
that's usually the formula
that it follows --

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.536
that there was a shock
and it induced a wake-up call

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.016
and that produced a leap to a safer place.
