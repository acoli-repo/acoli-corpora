00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.056
This was a time, let's remember,
of tremendous ideological ferment,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.136
when many different ideas
about how to organize societies

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.456
did battle with one another
in the public square.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.336
A time when humanity dared to dream big

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.616
about different kinds of futures,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.136
many of them organized
along radically egalitarian lines.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.896
Now, not all of these ideas were good

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.880
but this was an era
of explosive imagining.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.296
This meant that the movements
demanding change

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.296
knew what they were against --
crushing poverty, widening inequality --
