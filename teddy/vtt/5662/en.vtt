00:00:01.083 --> 00:00:02.351
Like many people

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:05.101
who have been fortunate enough
to be more or less healthy,

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:07.851
I spent most of my life
never thinking much about my body.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.934
Something that I relied on
to get me around,

00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:11.559
not to mind the occasional bash

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:14.518
and not to complain too much
if I wasn't getting enough rest.

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.976
But that all changed for me
when I became pregnant.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.351
Suddenly, my body was this machine
performing an incredible task.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.601
That was something
that I had to take notice of

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.726
and look after,
so that it could do its job.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.059
I've been a documentary photographer
for nearly 20 years now

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.518
but I never turned the camera
on myself until that time.
