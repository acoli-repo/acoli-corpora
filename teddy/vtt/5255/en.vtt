00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:08.534
When a new pathogen emerges,

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.204
our bodies and healthcare systems
are left vulnerable.

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:16.144
In times like these,
thereâ€™s an urgent need for a vaccine

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:19.492
to create widespread immunity
with minimal loss of life.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:23.962
So how quickly can we develop vaccines
when we need them most?

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:27.728
Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:32.071
In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches
