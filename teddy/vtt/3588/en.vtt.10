00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.349
Let me now turn to another project

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.869
which involves less harmful substances.

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:11.492
Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:14.014
Ah, some of you have. Excellent.

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.891
Should I skip that part?

00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:17.473
(Laughter)

00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:20.736
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.

00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:22.988
It's a liquid that is completely black.

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:25.482
It's got an oily consistency.

00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:28.942
And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,

00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:31.081
which makes it magnetic.
