Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.

00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:06.332
The first one has to do with making sound visible.

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:07.350
Now as you may know,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.976
sound travels in waves,

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:12.299
so if you have a speaker,

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.348
a speaker actually does nothing else

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:16.232
than taking the audio signal,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.829
transform it into a vibration,

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.530
which is then transported through the air,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.392
is captured by our ear,

00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:27.933
and transformed into an audio signal again.

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.779
Now I was thinking,

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.999
how can I make those sound waves visible?
