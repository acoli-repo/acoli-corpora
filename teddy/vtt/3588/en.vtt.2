00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:01.400
as you can see in this image,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.008
whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.506
of oil paint,

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:10.849
strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.115
or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:19.081
I'm always trying to link those two fields together.

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.471
What I find very intriguing about those two

00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.750
is that they both look at the same thing:

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.574
They are a response to their surroundings.

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:31.467
And yet, they do it in a very different way.
