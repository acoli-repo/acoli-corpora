00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.756
and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:32.111
and I would set up the speaker,

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.157
put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:37.978
and we would do this over and over again,

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:40.739
and it was until midday that I realized

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.076
that I had a completely red face

00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:46.162
because of the lights pointing at the speaker.

00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:48.468
What was so funny about it was that

00:04:48.468 --> 00:04:51.195
the speaker was only coming from the right side,

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:54.562
so the right side of my face was completely red

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:56.404
and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera

00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:59.246
for the rest of the week.

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.349
Let me now turn to another project
