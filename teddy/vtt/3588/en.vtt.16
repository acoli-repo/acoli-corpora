I can assure you I was fully conscious

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:04.391
while I was taking those pictures.

00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:08.493
Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,

00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:12.729
and alcohol has got some very interesting properties.

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:14.420
Maybe you have experienced

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.546
some of those properties before,

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.265
but I am talking about the physical properties,

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.500
not the other ones.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.700
So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.043
would spread in the air,

00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:31.123
and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.
