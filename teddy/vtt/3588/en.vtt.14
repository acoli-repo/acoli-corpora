00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:00.910
So what happened now is,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.154
when the watercolor was flowing into the structure,

00:07:04.154 --> 00:07:07.505
the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.841
That's because the ferrofluid itself

00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:12.024
is hydrophobic.

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:14.187
That means it doesn't mix with the water.

00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:17.196
And at the same time, it tries to maintain its position

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:18.561
above the magnet,

00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:21.956
and therefore, it creates those amazing-looking

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:25.289
structures of channels and tiny little ponds

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.869
of colorful water paint.

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.620
So that was the second project.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.972
Let me now turn to the last project,
