00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:31.467
And yet, they do it in a very different way.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.514
If you look at science on one hand,

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:36.937
science is a very rational approach

00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:38.418
to its surroundings,

00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:40.507
whereas art on the other hand

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:44.810
is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.827
What I am trying to do is I'm trying

00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:49.468
to bring those two views into one

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:53.418
so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:56.612
but also to the viewer's brain.

00:01:56.612 --> 00:02:01.278
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.
