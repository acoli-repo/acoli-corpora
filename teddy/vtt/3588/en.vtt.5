00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.999
how can I make those sound waves visible?

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.115
So I came up with the following setup.

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:39.835
I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:42.070
of plastic on top of that speaker,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.737
and then I added tiny little crystals

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:46.714
on top of that speaker.

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:49.614
And now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:53.496
it would cause the crystals to move up and down.

00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:55.795
Now this happens very fast,

00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:57.747
in the blink of an eye,

00:02:57.747 --> 00:03:01.434
so, together with LG, we captured this motion
