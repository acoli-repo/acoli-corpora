I agree, it looks pretty amazing.

00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:03.590
But I have to tell you a funny story.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.104
I got an indoor sunburn doing this

00:04:06.104 --> 00:04:08.152
while shooting in Los Angeles.

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:10.427
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn

00:04:10.427 --> 00:04:12.153
just on any of the beaches,

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:14.223
but I got mine indoors,

00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:15.932
and what happened is that,

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:18.753
if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,

00:04:18.753 --> 00:04:23.242
you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:25.771
So we had this speaker set up,

00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:27.370
and we had the camera facing it,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.756
and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,
