00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:31.081
which makes it magnetic.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.634
So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:37.427
it would change its appearance.

00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:41.222
Now I've got a live demonstration over here

00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:43.798
to show this to you.

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:50.486
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,

00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:54.014
and underneath that plate, there is a magnet.

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:57.006
Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid

00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:00.310
to that magnet.
