00:10:57.097 --> 00:11:00.180
So, I have now showed you three projects,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.832
and you might ask yourself, what is it good for?

00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:04.423
What's the idea behind it?

00:11:04.423 --> 00:11:05.756
Is it just a waste of whiskey?

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:09.981
Is it just some strange materials?

00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:12.794
Those three projects, they're based on very simple

00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:14.456
scientific phenomena,

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:17.197
such as magnetism, the sound waves,

00:11:17.197 --> 00:11:21.239
or over here, the physical properties of a substance,

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:23.151
and what I'm trying to do

00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:26.300
is I'm trying to use these phenomena

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.417
and show them in a poetic and unseen way,

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:31.836
and therefore invite the viewer
