is that real dialogue is in fact possible.

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:04.726
And that when given a chance
and structure around doing so,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.184
many, not all,
but many of our fellow citizens

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.333
are eager to engage with the other.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.101
Too often journalists
have sharpened divides

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.708
in the name of drama or readership
or in service to our own views.

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:23.184
And too often we've gone to each side
quoting a partisan voice on one side

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.059
and a partisan voice on the other

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.018
with a telling anecdotal lead
and a pithy final quote,

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:30.375
all of which readers
are keen to mine for bias.
