00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01.684
At every stage, we take time
to answer people's questions --

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:03.708
explain why we're doing what we're doing.

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:06.726
We tell people that it's not a trap:

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.726
no one's there to tell you you're stupid,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.143
no one's there to tell you
your experience doesn't matter.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:15.226
And we always ask
for a really different sort of behavior,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.434
a repatterning away
from the reflexive name-calling,

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:19.934
so entrenched in our discourse

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958
that most of us, on all sides,
don't even notice it anymore.

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:28.976
So people often come
into our conversations a bit angrily.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.476
They say things like,
"How can you believe X?"
