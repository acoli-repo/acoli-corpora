00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.333
but then, once there,
do something really different.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.268
We knew we wanted to take
the core tools of our craft --

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.976
careful vetting of information,
diligent research, curiosity,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.393
a commitment to serving the public good --

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:44.851
to serving our democracy --

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.333
and do something new.

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:48.851
And so we mapped out this process,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.643
what we call dialogue journalism,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.809
for going to the heart
of social and political divides,

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.226
and then, once there, building
journalism-supported conversations

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.125
between people on opposite sides
of polarizing issues.
