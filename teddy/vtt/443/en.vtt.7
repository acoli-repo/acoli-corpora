00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:34.018
begin to see the simplistic and often
mean-spirited caricatures they carry.

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:35.309
And in that --

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.292
after that, we can move
into a process of genuine conversation.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.184
So in the two years since that launch --
California/Alabama Project --

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.476
we've gone on to host
dialogues and partnerships

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.018
with media organizations
across the country.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:51.851
And they've been about
some of our most contentious issues:

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:54.292
guns, immigration, race, education.

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:57.518
And what we found,

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:58.809
remarkably,

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:01.434
is that real dialogue is in fact possible.
