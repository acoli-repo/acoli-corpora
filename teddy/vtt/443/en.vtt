00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:03.976
So in the run-up to the 2016 election,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.559
I was, like most of us,
watching the rise in discord and vitriol

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.101
and nastiness in our public spaces.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.601
It was this crazy uptick in polarization.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.167
It was both disheartening and distressing.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.434
And so I started thinking,
with a fellow journalist, Jeremy Hay,

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.768
about how we might practice
our craft differently.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:26.976
How we might go to the heart of divides,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.268
to places of conflict,

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:29.809
like journalists always have,

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.333
but then, once there,
do something really different.
