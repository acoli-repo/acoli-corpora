00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.434
in that time between the election
and the inauguration,

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.601
we partnered with the Alabama Media Group
to do something really different.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.851
We brought 25 Trump supporters
from Alabama together

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.958
in conversation with
25 Clinton supporters from California.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:47.934
And we brought them together
in a closed, moderated Facebook group

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.583
that we kept open for a month.

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:52.934
What we wanted to do

00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.893
was to give them a place to engage
with genuine curiosity and openness.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.559
And we wanted to support them
in building relationships,

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.042
not just with each other
but with us as journalists.
