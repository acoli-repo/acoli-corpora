00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:02.143
And they said this:
"That we're crazy, liberal Californians."

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.643
"That we're not patriotic."

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.239
"We're snobby and we're elitist."

00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:07.846
"We're godless and we're permissive
with our children."

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.184
"And that we're focused
on our careers, not our family."

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:13.809
"That we're elitist,
pie-in-the-sky intellectuals,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.393
rich people, Whole Foods-eating,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.708
very out of touch."

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:23.268
So by asking questions like this
at the start of every conversation

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:26.518
and by identifying
and sharing stereotypes,

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.768
we find that people --
people on all sides --

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:34.018
begin to see the simplistic and often
mean-spirited caricatures they carry.
