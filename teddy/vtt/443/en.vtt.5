00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.559
what they thought the Clinton supporters
in California thought of them,

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.476
this is some of what they said.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.643
"They think we are religious
Bible thumpers."

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.858
"That we're backwards
and hickish, and stupid."

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.101
"They think that we all have
Confederate flags in our yards,

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.268
that we're racist
and sexist and uneducated."

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.417
"They think we're barefoot and pregnant,
with dirt driveways."

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.309
"And they think we're all prissy butts

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.143
and that we walk around in hoop skirts
with cotton fields in the background."

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.893
And then we asked that same question
of the Californians:

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.768
"What do you think
the Alabamians think about you?"

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:02.143
And they said this:
"That we're crazy, liberal Californians."
