00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.785
In the last few years, I helped two friends

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.026
have the end of life they wanted.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:37.354
Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.328
living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch

00:00:40.328 --> 00:00:42.419
in the mountains of Sonoma County.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:46.343
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:49.650
so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.883
for the bears and lions and so many other things

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:53.490
that lived there.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.503
This was their dream.

00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:58.786
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:02.267
They were both only children who chose not to have kids.
