You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation

or staying at home is your best choice.

00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:10.899
In either case, do not settle.

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.265
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers

00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:16.865
before we found the perfect team

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.104
led by Marsha,

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:25.826
who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:28.402
but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:30.828
when you can't get out there,
