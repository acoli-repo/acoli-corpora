00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.739
A plan involves answering

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.097
straightforward questions about the end you want.

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.794
Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:09.691
What do you want in terms of medical intervention?

00:03:09.691 --> 00:03:12.065
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:13.542
You will need advocates.

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:15.173
Having more than one increases your chance

00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:16.933
of getting the end you want.

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.513
Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:21.838
You want someone who has the time and proximity

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:24.429
to do this job well, and you want someone

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.668
who can work with people under the pressure

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:29.029
of an ever-changing situation.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.723
Hospital readiness is critical.
