00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:30.828
when you can't get out there,

00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:33.555
and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises

00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:35.161
but knows when you need to hear

00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:38.753
that your wife is in good hands.

00:04:38.753 --> 00:04:41.380
Finally, last words.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.731
What do you want to hear at the very end,

00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.339
and from whom would you like to hear it?

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.666
In my experience, you'll want to hear

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.668
that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:55.620
When you believe it's okay to let go, you will.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.490
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
