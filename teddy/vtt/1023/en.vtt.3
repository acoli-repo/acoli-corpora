00:01:28.177 --> 00:01:31.331
What we found is that, with a plan and the right people,

00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:34.885
quality of life can remain high.

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.324
The beginning of the end is triggered

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:39.215
by a mortality awareness event, and during this time,

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:43.453
Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:45.985
to take their ranch over when they were gone.

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:49.565
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:53.041
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.257
But one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:57.813
Jim and Shirley spent this time

00:01:57.813 --> 00:01:59.816
letting friends know that their end was near

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:04.872
and that they were okay with that.
