00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:30.202
And then we wanted to put another play on

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:31.602
the year or so later.

00:11:31.626 --> 00:11:33.739
I thought I was going
to be cast in the play.

00:11:33.763 --> 00:11:37.037
I'd been the stage manager
and had a small part in the previous one.

00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:39.529
And we cast all the parts,
or he cast all the parts.

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:42.566
He said he couldn't direct it that year,
but he could cast them.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.506
So he came along to the casting session.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.853
All the big parts went,
all the small parts went,

00:11:46.877 --> 00:11:48.333
and I was still sitting there,

00:11:48.357 --> 00:11:51.720
and I thought, well, that's probably
me doing the stage managing again.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.092
And he said, "I've been giving
some thought to who to direct the play."

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:57.802
He said, "I can't do it this year,
but I have a proposal.

00:11:57.826 --> 00:11:59.079
I think Ken should do it."

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:01.463
And I nearly passed out, truthfully.
