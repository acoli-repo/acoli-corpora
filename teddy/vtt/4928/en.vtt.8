00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.734
And it threw the whole family
into that world.

00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:03.245
CA: But despite that, or because of that,

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.957
you did pretty well academically,

00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:08.128
and you ended up in a grammar school,

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:14.191
which at the time was the higher
of two tiers of British general education.

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:16.553
KR: Well, yes. It was
interesting how it happened,

00:04:16.577 --> 00:04:20.410
because we didn't really pay attention
to people's disabilities.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:21.908
That wasn't what defined us.

00:04:21.932 --> 00:04:24.266
I mean, I didn't think of myself
as having polio,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.825
and I didn't think of the kids
I was talking to as having cerebral palsy.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.373
They were interesting or they weren't.
We were just kids kicking it around.
