It's not one size fits all at all.

00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:03.476
KR: No, I think that's axiomatic.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.509
Education is about people.

00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:09.217
It's about human growth and development,

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.644
and it's a very personal process.

00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:15.979
There's a very important cultural
and social dimension to education,

00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:18.335
but we're, each of us, unique individuals,

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:20.054
and we think differently,

00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:24.326
we have different capacities,
different talents, different proclivities,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.368
and one of the great criticisms that
I have of mass systems of education

00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:32.160
is that they tend to wash out
the differences.
