It's been seen more than
50 million times now,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.032
a talk called
"Do Schools Kill Creativity?"

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:37.785
He recorded it back in 2006.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.111
It was one of the first six
TED Talks that we ever released,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.441
and probably that talk
did as much as any other

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:46.195
to really put TED Talks
as a whole on the map.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.896
(Audio) Sir Ken Robinson: I heard
a great story recently,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.029
of a little girl who was
in a drawing lesson.

00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:53.164
She was six, and she was
at the back drawing.

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:56.351
And the teacher said, "This little girl
hardly ever paid attention,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.144
and in this drawing lesson, she did."

00:00:58.168 --> 00:00:59.661
And the teacher was fascinated.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.471
She went over to her, and she said,
"What are you drawing?"
