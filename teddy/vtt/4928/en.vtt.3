(Audio) KR: I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:39.360
we grow out of it;

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:41.696
or rather, we get educated out of it.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.776
CA: Sir Ken has been
a scholar of education

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.943
pretty much all his life:
as a professor, a policy advisor

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:48.689
and an author.

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:54.175
And I'm so excited today to have a chance
to ask him more about his ideas.

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.822
Sir Ken Robinson, welcome.

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.877
KR: It's a real pleasure,
Chris, thank you.
