00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.980
than the sort of abilities that tend
to be cultivated in that system.

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.729
I'm not critical of
academic education itself;

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:07.918
I rather enjoyed it.

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.969
I mean, I was a professor at a university.

00:08:09.993 --> 00:08:12.743
I write books. I did a PhD.
It's not as if I'm down on it.

00:08:12.767 --> 00:08:13.884
(Laughter)

00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:15.939
But it's not the only form of life,

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:18.227
and it's certainly not
the highest form of life.

00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:19.478
It's just a form of life.

00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:21.787
CA: So any system of education
that just says,

00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:24.838
"Let's look for the intelligent kids

00:08:24.862 --> 00:08:28.211
and give them special treatment,"
as if that was one spectrum,

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:29.746
one measurement,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.504
that's misguided.
