Welcome to the TED Interview.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.459
I'm Chris Anderson,

00:00:08.483 --> 00:00:11.877
and this is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker,

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:14.805
and we get to dive much
deeper into their ideas

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.382
than was possible during their TED Talk.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.684
Today, I couldn't be more excited,

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.565
because I'm here with none other
than Sir Ken Robinson.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.201
Sir Ken is the man responsible
for the most-viewed TED Talk of all time.

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:30.805
It's been seen more than
50 million times now,
