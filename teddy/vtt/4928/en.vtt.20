00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:03.620
And how do you even think
of creativity in education?

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:07.377
KR: Well, creativity is only
a piece of the story, really.

00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:11.077
It's what I happened
to talk about on the TED stage,

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:13.929
and I did write a report about it
and I am interested in it,

00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:16.231
but it's not the be-all and end-all

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:19.266
of what I think should be
going on in education.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.571
My route into it,

00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:24.895
like I think the route most people
take into their lives, their careers,

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.512
was circuitous.

00:10:26.536 --> 00:10:32.370
When I was at school, I had no idea
what I was going to do, none whatever.
