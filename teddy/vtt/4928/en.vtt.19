KR: Yes, there's no question of that.

00:09:30.962 --> 00:09:33.143
And that wasn't covert,
it wasn't accidental,

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:36.153
it wasn't something that people
were embarrassed to talk about.

00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:38.618
If you read the legislation,
the 1944 Education Act,

00:09:38.642 --> 00:09:40.882
it was sewn into the fabric
of the legislation.

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:43.202
It was a deliberate piece
of social engineering.

00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:45.215
And it had a lot of benefits, by the way.

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:46.787
I benefited enormously from it.

00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:49.356
But as many people
who benefited from it did not,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.490
and that's the problem with it.

00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:55.489
CA: So where did this interest --

00:09:55.513 --> 00:09:59.774
perhaps even obsession with --
creativity in education come from?

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:03.620
And how do you even think
of creativity in education?
