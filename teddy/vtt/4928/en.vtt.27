against the importance
of the sciences and technology.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:37.069
On the contrary, my way into this
happened to be through theater,

00:13:37.093 --> 00:13:40.238
but I'm always very keen
to emphasize this,

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:41.422
it's important.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:46.720
And I certainly never have wanted
to conflate creativity with the arts.

00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:47.981
I mean that in two ways.

00:13:48.005 --> 00:13:50.835
The arts aren't important
because they're creative.

00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:53.684
Rather, they're not only important
because they're creative.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.016
They're important for all kinds
of other reasons.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.089
They're not the creative bit of education.

00:13:58.113 --> 00:14:03.932
The arts can't be reduced to shibboleths
about the importance of creative work,
