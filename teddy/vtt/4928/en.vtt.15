is that they tend to wash out
the differences.

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:35.509
For example, going to the grammar school
suited me down to the ground.

00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:36.751
I liked it.

00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:38.126
But it wasn't for everybody.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.944
A lot of people went to grammar schools
who didn't like it,

00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:45.044
and a lot of people didn't go to them
because they didn't pass the test.

00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:46.399
They might have enjoyed it,

00:07:46.423 --> 00:07:49.304
but they weren't given
the opportunity I was given.

00:07:49.328 --> 00:07:52.214
The interesting thing
about that system is,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:55.759
it's based on a particular view
of intelligence,

00:07:55.783 --> 00:07:59.956
but intelligence is clearly
a much larger idea

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.980
than the sort of abilities that tend
to be cultivated in that system.
