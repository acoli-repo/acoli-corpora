00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:32.616
by the time they got
to my end of the list,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.710
and I was just glad
not to be called "Five."

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:36.413
(Laughter)

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:38.729
So I grew up there,

00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:43.260
and I had no idea growing up
what I might ever go on to do,

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:45.506
or if I would ever go on
to do anything at all.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.221
So it's always been a big theme in the
work I do that we create our own lives.

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:51.411
It doesn't really matter
where you start from.

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:54.315
CA: As a child, you were hit
by quite a severe illness.

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.044
Will you talk about that?

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.487
KR: Yeah. Until I was four,

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.009
my father was convinced I was
going to be the family soccer player.
