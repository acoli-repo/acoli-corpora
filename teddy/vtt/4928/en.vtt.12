called "11 Plus,"

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:04.370
and it was a public exam
that was taken at the age of 11,

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:06.579
on the base of which,
you were allocated --

00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:08.635

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.395
and Miss York and the head teacher
and Charles Stratford clearly thought

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.556
I was capable of passing the 11 Plus,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.947

00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:22.395
Anyway, the upshot of it was
that I took the 11 Plus,

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.217
and I was the first person, I think,
in the history of the schools

00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.916
to actually do that.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.962
In England at the time,
and certainly in Liverpool,
