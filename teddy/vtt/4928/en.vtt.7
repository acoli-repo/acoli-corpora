00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:31.060
and I was paralyzed
overnight, pretty much.

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:37.895
And I was thrown into
the world of special education.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.116
Actually, in the early '50s, people
weren't very good at euphemisms.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.802
We hadn't really got the hang of them.

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:47.182
So I went to the Margaret Bevan School
for the Physically Handicapped,

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.888
where I was in the company
of a lot of other people

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:53.156
with calipers and braces and wheelchairs

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.428
and various sorts of physical
illnesses or handicaps.

00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.734
And it threw the whole family
into that world.
