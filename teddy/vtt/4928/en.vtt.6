00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.009
my father was convinced I was
going to be the family soccer player.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.216
I showed an early and precocious
talent for it, evidently.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.675
I was strong and quick.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.316
I had good eye-hand coordination,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.412
and my dad had been a semi-professional
football player himself.

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:17.452
But in the early '50s, there was
an epidemic of poliomyelitis,

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:19.926
which spread right across
Europe and North America,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.104
and I got it, yes.

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:22.329
So at the age of four,

00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:25.737
I was in hospital with polio.

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:27.127
I was in for eight months,

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:31.060
and I was paralyzed
overnight, pretty much.
