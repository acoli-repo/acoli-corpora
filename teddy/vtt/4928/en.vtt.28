The arts can't be reduced to shibboleths
about the importance of creative work,

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:08.682
because through the arts, we express
deep issues of cultural value.

00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:12.399
We express the fabric
of our relationships with other people,

00:14:12.423 --> 00:14:15.793
our connection with the world around us
as well as the world within us.

00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:19.696
They are forms of language
in their own right,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.252
language broadly conceived,

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:24.726
and they are among the most profound ways
that we come to know ourselves

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.544
and our relationships to other people

00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:28.309
and how cultures become defined.

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:30.686
They are deeply important.
