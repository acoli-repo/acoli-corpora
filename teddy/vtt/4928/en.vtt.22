I think it's important
people understand that.

00:11:00.124 --> 00:11:01.616
CA: I gave that up a while ago.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.261
KR: Whether that's a good
or a bad thing, we don't know.

00:11:04.285 --> 00:11:05.601
But yeah, so I had no idea.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:09.485
And then when I was in what we call
in the UK the "sixth-form" --

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:12.361
it's the junior and senior
years here in America --

00:11:12.385 --> 00:11:14.478
a group of us wanted to put some plays on.

00:11:14.502 --> 00:11:18.032
We'd read plays in the English class,
but we wanted to perform them.

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:21.001
It seemed a bit of a heretical idea,
but we thought, why not,

00:11:21.025 --> 00:11:22.815
because they seemed very interesting.

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:25.450
And an English teacher
helped us with the plays.

00:11:25.474 --> 00:11:27.125
He directed the first couple.

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:30.202
And then we wanted to put another play on
