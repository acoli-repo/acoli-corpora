The kids who went
to secondary modern schools

00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:02.362
were thought to be
less capable of those things

00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:04.882
and would probably go on
to some form of manual work.

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:07.614
And the point about it was,
the whole ethos,

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:10.211
was that this was about
equal opportunities

00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:13.413
and "parity of esteem,"
as the expression went,

00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:15.728
but we all figured out
if you passed the 11 Plus

00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:17.257
you went to the grammar school,

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.722
and if you failed, you went
to the secondary modern.

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:22.811
So right at the age of 11,
there was a system of sheep and goats.

00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:25.015
CA: Almost tied into
the British class system.

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:27.007
This was your ticket to the middle class.

00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.081
Otherwise, enjoy your life
as working class.

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:30.938
KR: Yes, there's no question of that.
