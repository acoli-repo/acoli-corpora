When I was at school, I had no idea
what I was going to do, none whatever.

00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:37.833
The most practical step I took
to having any kind of career

00:10:37.857 --> 00:10:42.062
when I was 16 was to send off
for a set of application forms

00:10:42.086 --> 00:10:44.043
to become a manager at Marks and Spencer.

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:47.343
That was it, I thought.
What could possibly go wrong?

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:51.547
CA: Marks and Spencer
is a very sort of staid,

00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:54.414
very English clothing store, primarily.

00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:57.902
KR: Yes. Most people in Britain
get underwear from Marks and Spencer.

00:10:57.926 --> 00:11:00.100
I think it's important
people understand that.
