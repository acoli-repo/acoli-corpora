In England at the time,
and certainly in Liverpool,

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:34.615
passing the 11 Plus was like a passport
onto another social plane,

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.444
another planet entirely.

00:06:36.468 --> 00:06:39.400
Anyway, I passed the 11 Plus
and I was sent to the collegiate,

00:06:39.424 --> 00:06:41.692
and it was an absolute turning point.

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:43.490
CA: So any of those individuals

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:46.520
who gave you that sort of
personalized moment in education,

00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:48.872
if they could have seen
the story play out,

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:51.677
they would have, I guess,
considered that time well spent,

00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:53.041
decisions well made.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:56.052
You often speak and write
about the importance

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:59.232
of just a personalized approach to kids.

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:00.928
It's not one size fits all at all.
