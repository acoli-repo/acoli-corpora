00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.416
The first one:

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.800
Pat and I have no science background.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.336
At the time, he's the manager
of a construction company,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.216
and I'm a former college chaplain
stay-at-home mom --

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.880
hardly the backgrounds
to take the research world by storm.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.160
The second barrier:

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.840
researchers don't share.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.520
People told us you can't herd cats.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.176
Well, yes you can if you move their food.
