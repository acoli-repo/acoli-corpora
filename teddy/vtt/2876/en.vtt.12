WEBVTT

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.096
a nonprofit dedicated to initiating
research and conducting it on PXE

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600
and also supporting
individuals with the disease.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.176
Using traditional media,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.616
we garnered around
100-150 people around the world

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.896
who we asked,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.176
would you give us your blood,
your tissue, your medical histories,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400
your medical records?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.040
And we brought all of that together.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.880
We quickly learned that this shared
resource was not going to be enough.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.256
And so we decided we had
to do hardcore bench science --
