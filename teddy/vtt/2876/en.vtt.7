00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.736
A few days later,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.176
researchers come
from a medical center in New York

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.720
and say they want blood, too.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.920
"These are children.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.656
They're five and seven years old.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.680
Don't make them face the needle twice.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.400
Go and get your share
from the other researchers."

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.656
They laugh, incredulous.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.880
"Share?"

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.600
It is then that we learn that there
is little sharing in biomedical research.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.216
This moment, more than any other,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.
