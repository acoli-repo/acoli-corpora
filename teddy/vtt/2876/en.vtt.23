Just before they entered their teens,
our kids stopped us in our tracks

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.376
and said, "You have to stop worrying
about making a difference,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.656
making an impact,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.656
and instead, like us,
learn to live with disease

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.560
rather than fight it."

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.896
I have to ask,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.160
where does all my fear come from?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.080
The kids' declaration
shines a spotlight on that fear.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.840
It arises from a bedrock of love.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.480
I love Elizabeth and Ian.
