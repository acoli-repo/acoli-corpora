00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.160
Our goal is to work without boundaries.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.000
That sounds abstract,
but for us it's quite practical.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.096
When we're frustrated
that entities won't share data --

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.216
data that comes from people who gave
their energy, their time, their blood

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.760
and even their tears --

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.136
we need to stop and ask,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.280
"How is it true that we
could share, but we aren't?"

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.360
We're part of this system, too.
