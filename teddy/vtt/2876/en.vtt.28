00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.496
And so I invite you, us, we,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.096
to turn toward our fear;

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.056
to embrace the things that scare us

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.216
and find the love at the center.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.456
We'll not only find ourselves there

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.456
but we'll also be able
to step into the shoes of those we fear

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.840
and those who fear us.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.520
If we breathe into that fear

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.216
and are vulnerable with the systems
and people who challenge us,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.320
our power as changemakers
grows exponentially.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.656
And when we realize

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.336
that working on our inner life
is working on our outer life
