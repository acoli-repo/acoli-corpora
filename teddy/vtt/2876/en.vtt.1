This was 1994

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200
and the story actually starts
a few years earlier.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.600
For a couple of years I had noticed
a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.880
that looked like prickly heat.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.840
For those same years,
my father and brother both died of cancer,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.280
and I was probably
overanxious about illness.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.896
The doctors assured us
there was nothing wrong

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.656
and I shouldn't worry,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.080
but I wasn't so sure.
