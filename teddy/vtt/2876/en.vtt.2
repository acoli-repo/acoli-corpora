00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.296
And so without a referral,
and paying out-of-pocket,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.519
I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.896
She was probably
just allergic to something,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.320
but why did it appear
just on the sides of her neck, this rash?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.776
So it's two days before Christmas,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
1994,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.576
and the dermatologist
takes a quick look at her neck and says,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640
"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
And then he shuts off the lights
and looks in her eyes.
