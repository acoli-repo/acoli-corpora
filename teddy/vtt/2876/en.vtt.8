00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.816
Pat and I went to a medical school library

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.800
and we copied every article
we could find on PXE.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.680
We didn't understand a thing.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.576
We bought medical dictionaries
and scientific textbooks

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.743
and read everything
we could get our hands on.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.416
And though we still didn't understand,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.296
we could see patterns,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.696
and it became quickly
apparent within a month

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680
that there was no systematic effort
to understand PXE.
