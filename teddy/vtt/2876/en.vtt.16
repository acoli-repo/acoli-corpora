00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.256
we also realized what we
were doing for one disease,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.400
we should do for all diseases.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.016
We joined with, and I eventually led,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.256
Genetic Alliance --

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.576
a network of health advocacy,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.816
patient advocacy,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.480
research and health organizations.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.616
We built scalable
and extensible resources,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.456
like biobanks and registries
and directories of support

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.800
for all diseases.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.856
And as I learned about all those diseases
and all those disease communities,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.736
I realized that there were
two secrets in health care

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.560
that were impacting me greatly.
