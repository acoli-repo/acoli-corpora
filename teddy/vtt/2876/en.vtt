00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.576
The best Christmas my children ever had

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920
was also the worst Christmas
my husband and I ever had.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.616
Elizabeth, age seven,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.496
and her brother, Ian, age five,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.239
couldn't imagine why they were getting
everything they wanted for Christmas.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.960
The reason Santa was so generous

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.016
was because of something
my husband Pat and I knew

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.880
and the kids couldn't comprehend.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.600
Something that we had just learned,
and it terrified us.
