It's 4am, you've been awake
for forty hours,

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:07.603
when you unlock a puzzle
containing this video

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:12.603
of some kind of dance-off between
a chicken and a roller-skating beaver.

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:14.151
(Laughter)

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.462
The confusion and delight
you're experiencing

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.579
is a typical moment
at the MIT Mystery Hunt,

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.944
which is basically the Olympics
meets Burning Man

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:23.672
for a specific type of nerd.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:24.697
(Laughter)

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.063
Today, I'm going to take you
inside this strange,

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:30.378
intellectually masochistic
and incredibly joyful world.
