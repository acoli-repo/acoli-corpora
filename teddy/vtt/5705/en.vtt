00:00:01.174 --> 00:00:04.722
My first year in graduate school,
studying cooperation in monkeys,

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:06.969
I spent a lot of time outside,

00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:09.886
just watching our groups
of capuchin monkeys interact.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.827
One afternoon, I was out back
feeding peanuts to one of our groups,

00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:16.573
which required distracting
one of our males, Ozzie,

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:19.169
enough so that the other monkeys
could get some.

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:21.328
Ozzie loved peanuts,

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:24.576
and he always tried to do
anything he could to grab some.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.575
On that day, however,

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.996
he began trying to bring other things
from his enclosure to me
