00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:03.836
I found myself in the pandemic
with two little kids,

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.396
working full time.

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:07.436
And Girls Who Code got a Super Bowl ad,

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.196
I mean, we were on top of the world.

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:10.596
And the pandemic hit

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:13.156
and I found myself
having to go back to work,

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.276
take care of a newborn
homeschool a six-year-old,

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.756
you know, and save my global
nonprofit from being shut down.

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:24.196
And I think my entire leadership team
was mostly working parents,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:25.556
working moms,

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:28.276
and many of us were saying,
"Well, when the schools open,

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:29.876
everything will be okay."
