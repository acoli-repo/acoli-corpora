(Imitating vocal fry)
or adding vocal fry for apathy.

00:07:31.163 --> 00:07:33.234
(Laughter)

00:07:33.258 --> 00:07:36.029
But tell me, according to this research,

00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:39.910
when do you reckon boys begin to perform
and alter their voices?

00:07:39.934 --> 00:07:41.124
Now, I guessed 18,

00:07:41.148 --> 00:07:43.481
because "men mature later," right?

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:45.672
Wrong.

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:47.753
The answer was four years old.

00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:51.563
Because that is when boys learn
not to cry or squeal.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.363
That those are not manly sounds.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.991
And that's when I realized

00:07:57.015 --> 00:08:00.759
that a fangirl's shriek
is therefore like a superpower.
