I watch videos that show me how to make
DIY love totems for Harry --

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.522
for example, a lampshade
covered in photos of his face,

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:36.808
or a key ring that states
the exact time of his birth.

00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:38.887
I read hours of fan fiction,

00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.299
and I fall down this specific rabbit hole

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:44.545
of stories that actually
place me as a protagonist

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.403
inside of various imagined
romances with him.

00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:50.807
So in one, I tell him
that I'm pregnant with his child.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:54.528
In another, we meet in hospital
where we're both fighting cancer,

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:57.329
and in another, we fall so deeply in love

00:02:57.353 --> 00:02:59.697
that we become fugitives who kill people.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.123
