I read them describe
these "young banshees."

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:02.632
I read one journalist say,

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.641
"It's a commonly known fact
since the age of the Beatles

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:07.814
that there is nothing
scarier in this world

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:10.206
than a group of excited teenage girls."

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.230
(Laughter)

00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:16.244
And then I ask myself a question
I've never considered in my life.

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:22.957
Why is it that the image of young girls
screaming their lungs out with excitement

00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:24.442
for a pop star

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:28.315
is considered crazy, psycho,

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:30.934
scary, a bit much?
