if girls grow up in a world

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:14.142
where words like "crazy" and "psycho"
and "hysterical" are casually used

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.085
to describe female enthusiasm,

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:21.212

that those girls get to see themselves?

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:25.902

in a world that tells them

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:30.387
that they are designed
just a bit crazier than the boys,
