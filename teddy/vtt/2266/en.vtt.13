00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:30.387
that they are designed
just a bit crazier than the boys,

00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.706
then isn't that a little bit
like telling them

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.450
that they are born less capable
of rationality than men,

00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:38.611
less capable of reason

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:43.307
and unworthy of the same
intellectual respect as their brothers.

00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:48.333
Separately, I become obsessed
with female screams.

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:49.903
Not in a creepy way.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:52.261
I'm talking about, like,
those shrieks and squeals

00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:54.283
that fangirls let out at concerts.

00:06:54.307 --> 00:06:55.617
I want to know why it is

00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.037
that some people instinctively flinch
when I merely describe the sound,

00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:01.382
like it's painful just to think about it.
