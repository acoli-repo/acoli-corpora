who apparently had torn
a parked BMW to literal pieces,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.662
because the band had supposedly
just been sat in it.

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:40.408
In the '60s, the Beatles
were the biggest boy band on the planet,

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:43.265
but when I met this girl in 2015,

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.090
the biggest boy band on the planet
was none other than One Direction.

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:52.188
And Harry Styles was a member
of One Direction.

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:55.958
Harry Styles was reputed
for his compassionate demeanor

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.505
and perfect hair.

00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:01.823
I learn this when I read thousands
of tweets about him.
