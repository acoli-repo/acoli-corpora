Thanks.

00:09:00.634 --> 00:09:03.085
At one point, a girl sings,

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.006
"Why should I hide my feelings?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.767
Because they annoy you?

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:09.497
Or because it isn't what the boys do?"

00:09:10.347 --> 00:09:12.307
And as a former fangirl cynic,

00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.084
that is the question
that I want to leave you all with.

00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:17.990
Why should fangirls tone it down?

00:09:18.014 --> 00:09:19.641
Because they're crazy?

00:09:19.665 --> 00:09:22.101
Or because our definition of "reasonable"

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:25.005
is based on what
it is acceptable for men to do?

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.398
What if we rethink the judgments
we've been conditioned to feel

00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:33.081
when we see young women
screaming their lungs out with excitement?
