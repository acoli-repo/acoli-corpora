00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:01.823
I learn this when I read thousands
of tweets about him.

00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:03.847
I learn that he is a sweet cupcake.

00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.919
I learn that he is a perfect angel.

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:07.109
I learn that one time,

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.760
he vomited on the side
of a freeway in California

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:11.395
and that within two hours,

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.331
fans had turned the site of the vomit
into a sacred shrine.

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:15.664
(Laughter)

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:16.956
I scroll through --

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.535
(Laughter)

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.527
I scroll through fan-made
paintings of Harry,

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:23.963
baby photos of him,

00:02:23.987 --> 00:02:26.320
paintings of baby photos of him.

00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:30.127
I watch videos that show me how to make
DIY love totems for Harry --
