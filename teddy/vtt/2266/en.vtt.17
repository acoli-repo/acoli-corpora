My years of researching fangirls

00:08:30.228 --> 00:08:32.331
culminated in this determination

00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:35.442
to write something that celebrates
and vindicates them.

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:38.656
So I decided to make
this thriller comedy musical

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.934
that sounds like a Beyoncé concert
meets rave meets church.

00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:43.903
I called it "Fangirls,"

00:08:43.927 --> 00:08:46.664
and I designed it like a Trojan horse.

00:08:46.688 --> 00:08:48.934
So it appears to make fun
of these young women,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.301
only to, like, smuggle them
into your heart.

00:08:51.325 --> 00:08:53.887
(Laughter)

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:55.350
Thanks.

00:08:55.374 --> 00:08:57.594
(Applause)

00:08:57.618 --> 00:08:59.435
At one point --

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:00.610
Thanks.
