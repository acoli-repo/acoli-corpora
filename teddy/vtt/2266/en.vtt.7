I read them describe
how much Zayn had meant to them.

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:34.690
And I watch videos
of 10-year-old girls crying.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.679
But, like, really crying.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.284
And then I watch as people
repost these videos but with new titles

00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:46.168
that contain words like "crazy"
and "creepy" and "insane."

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.898
And suddenly, my YouTube sidebar contains

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:52.422
"Compilation: Fans react to Zayn leaving.

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:53.985
Psycho alert!"

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.990
Then I watch as mainstream
news outlets cover the story.

00:03:58.014 --> 00:04:00.823
I read them describe
these "young banshees."
