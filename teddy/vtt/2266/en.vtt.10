00:04:59.624 --> 00:05:02.523
I'd looked at images
of girls screaming for the Beatles,

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:04.300
the Backstreet Boys, One Direction,

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.222
and the word that had come to mind
was not "excitement"

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:08.530
but "hysteria."

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:11.770
And what I did not know
was the history of that word.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:13.999
That in the 19th century,

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:18.381
hysteria was considered to be
a legitimate female mental disorder

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:20.537
that could be diagnosed by doctors

00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:25.101
if women displayed excessive emotion
or difficult behavior.

00:05:25.847 --> 00:05:28.839
The word "hysterical" comes
from the Latin word "hystericus,"

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:30.514
meaning "of the womb,"
