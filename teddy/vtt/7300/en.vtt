00:00:01.676 --> 00:00:03.996
The air we breathe has changed.

00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:05.916
The mix of gases is shifting,

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.756
with more and more greenhouse gases
like carbon dioxide.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.876
And this shift is happening
faster each year.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:15.116
In fact, concentrations of CO2
have reached levels

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:17.156
never before breathed by humans,

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:18.716
since Homo sapiens evolved.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:20.636
In just a few hundred years,

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.796
eons of fossilized sunshine
have been burned as coal, oil and gas.

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:29.036
The exhaust has transformed
the entire atmosphere and ocean.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:30.796
Itâ€™s like a pollution blanket,
