00:09:57.265 --> 00:10:00.683
in all those months we spent together,

00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:02.633
was for me to speak to you in Korean.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.310
Just once.

00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:07.560
I was there to teach you English;

00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:09.101
you knew it wasn't allowed.

00:10:10.144 --> 00:10:15.875
But I understood then, you wanted
to share that bond of our mother tongue.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:21.282
I called you my gentlemen,

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:25.727
but I don't know if being gentle
in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:26.933
is a good thing.

00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:30.044
I don't want you to lead a revolution --
