When I arrived, they became my students.

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:37.618
2011 was a special year,

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:43.883
marking the 100th anniversary of the birth
of North Korea's original Great Leader,

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.366
Kim Il-Sung.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.361
To celebrate the occasion, the regime
shut down all universities,

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:54.195
and sent students off to the fields

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.353
to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal

00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:02.019
as the world's most powerful
and prosperous nation.
