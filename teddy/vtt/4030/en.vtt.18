Once, toward the end of my stay,
a student said to me,

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:09.743
"Professor, we never think of you
as being different from us.

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:15.874
Our circumstances are different,
but you're the same as us.

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:20.016
We want you to know that we truly
think of you as being the same."

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:29.806
Today, if I could respond
to my students with a letter of my own,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.306
which is of course impossible,
