00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:30.044
I don't want you to lead a revolution --

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:32.072
let some other young person do it.

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.581
The rest of the world might casually
encourage or even expect

00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:38.955
some sort of North Korean Spring,

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.501
but I don't want you to do anything risky,

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:45.369
because I know in your world,
someone is always watching.

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:49.511
I don't want to imagine
what might happen to you.

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:55.167
If my attempts to reach you have
inspired something new in you,

00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:56.741
I would rather you forget me.

00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:01.985
Become soldiers of your Great Leader,
and live long, safe lives.
