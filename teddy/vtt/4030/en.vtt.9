A volunteer would write a sentence
on the chalkboard,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.107
and the other students had to guess

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.134
whether it was a truth or a lie.

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:43.361
Once a student wrote, "I visited
China last year on vacation,"

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.993
and everyone shouted, "Lie!"

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.293
They all knew this wasn't possible.

00:04:49.317 --> 00:04:53.273
Virtually no North Korean is allowed
to leave the country.

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:57.618

requires a travel pass.
