I know hearing that would make
your lives there a bit more bearable,

00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:38.339
but no, I don't find
your capital beautiful.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.529
Not because it's monotone and concrete,

00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:43.416
but because of what it symbolizes:

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.273
a monster that feeds off
the rest of the country,

00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:51.170
where citizens are soldiers and slaves.

00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:55.342
All I see there is darkness.

00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:00.380
But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.
