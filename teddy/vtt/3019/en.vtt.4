00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:00.246
Well, it basically boils down to this:

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.826
the brain is made up of neurons

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.297
which are these little cells that send
electrical signals to each other.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.824
If you want to understand
how the brain works,

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:12.656
you have to be able to measure
the electrical activity of these neurons.

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.331
But to do that, you have to get
really close to the neurons

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:19.283
with some kind of electrical
recording device or a microscope.

00:02:19.563 --> 00:02:22.373
And so you can do that in mice
and you can do it in monkeys,

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:24.945
because you can physically
put things into their brain

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.015
but for some reason we still
can't do that in humans, OK?

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.903
So instead, we've invented
all these proxies.
