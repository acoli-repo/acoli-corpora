00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.918
would make that much easier
for the patient.

00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:04.291
In the end, it would be
like getting a shot.

00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:05.895
You just go in and you sit down

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.220
and there's a thing
that comes down on your head,

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:10.197
and a momentary sting and then it's done,

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.085
and you can go back about your day.

00:06:12.736 --> 00:06:17.529
So we're eventually able to do it

using lasers to drill the holes.

00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:22.864
And with the lasers,
it was fast and extremely reliable,

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:25.101
you couldn't even tell
the holes were there,

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:28.125
any more than you could tell
that one of your hairs was missing.

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:33.491
And I know it might sound crazy,
using lasers to drill holes in your skull,
