00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:30.156
And that robotic vacuum cleaner
that you know and love

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.694
went through a few generations,

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:34.561
and the improvements
were not always so good.

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:36.180
(Laughter)

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.840
It was not always for the better.

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:44.759
But actually, in the year 2100
most things are surprisingly recognizable.

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.192
It's just the brain is totally different.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.287
For example, in the year 2100,

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.168
we understand the root causes
of Alzheimer's.

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:57.906
So we can deliver targeted
genetic therapies or drugs

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.806
to stop the degenerative process
before it begins.
