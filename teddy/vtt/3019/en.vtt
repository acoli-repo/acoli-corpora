I want to tell you guys
something about neuroscience.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.840
I'm a physicist by training.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.436
About three years ago, I left physics

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.809
to come and try to understand
how the brain works.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.307
And this is what I found.

00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.395
Lots of people are working on depression.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.578
And that's really good,

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.323
depression is something
that we really want to understand.

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:19.514
Here's how you do it:

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:23.699
you take a jar and you fill it up,
about halfway, with water.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.905
And then you take a mouse,
and you put the mouse in the jar, OK?

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.279
And the mouse swims around
for a little while
