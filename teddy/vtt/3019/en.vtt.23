00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:31.117
as we had at the beginning of the century,

00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:32.363
we started to define them

00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:35.926
on the basis of the actual pathology
that we observed at the neural level.

00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:40.593
So for example, in the case of ADHD,

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.791
we discovered that there are
dozens of different diseases,

00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:46.824
all of which had been called ADHD
at the start of the century,

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:49.149
that actually had nothing
to do with each other,

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:51.291
except that they had similar symptoms.

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.997
And they needed to be treated
in different ways.

00:11:54.307 --> 00:11:56.554
So it was kind of incredible,
in retrospect,

00:11:56.578 --> 00:11:58.355
that at the beginning of the century,

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:00.696
we had been treating
all those different diseases
