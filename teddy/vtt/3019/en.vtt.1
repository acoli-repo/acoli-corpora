00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.279
And the mouse swims around
for a little while

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:32.691
and then at some point,
the mouse gets tired

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:34.649
and decides to stop swimming.

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:37.806
And when it stops swimming,
that's depression.

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:39.846
OK?

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.671
And I'm from theoretical physics,

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.363
so I'm used to people making
very sophisticated mathematical models

00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:50.268
to precisely describe physical phenomena,

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:52.744
so when I saw that this
is the model for depression,

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:55.705
I though to myself, "Oh my God,
we have a lot of work to do."

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.099
(Laughter)

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.074
But this is a kind of general
problem in neuroscience.
