00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.050
That "Aha!" moment, the moment
it all comes together, it clicks.

00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:37.649
And this was discovered
by two scientists in 2055,

00:10:37.673 --> 00:10:39.045
Barry and Late,

00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:42.732
who observed, in the dorsal
prefrontal cortex,

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:47.978
how in the brain of someone
trying to understand an idea,

00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:51.371
how different populations of neurons
would reorganize themselves --

00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:53.831
you're looking at neural
activity here in orange --

00:10:53.855 --> 00:10:57.593
until finally their activity aligns
in a way that leads to positive feedback.

00:10:58.339 --> 00:10:59.489
Right there.
