00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.723
The other thing that you can do
is you can do this --

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.338
electroencephalography -- you can put
these electrodes on your head, OK?

00:03:04.362 --> 00:03:06.505
And then you can measure your brain waves.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.204
And here, you're actually measuring
electrical activity.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:12.593
But you're not measuring
the activity of neurons.

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:15.355
You're measuring
these electrical currents,

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.678
sloshing back and forth in your brain.

00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:20.831
So the point is just
that these technologies that we have

00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:23.291
are really measuring the wrong thing.

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:26.268
Because, for most of the diseases
that we want to understand --

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:28.490
like, Parkinson's is the classic example.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.068
In Parkinson's, there's one particular
kind of neuron deep in your brain
