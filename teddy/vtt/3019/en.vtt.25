00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:30.807
And some of it is.

00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:33.942
I mean, I can't actually
see into the future.

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:35.332
I don't actually know

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:39.023
if we're going to be drilling hundreds
or thousands of microscopic holes

00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:40.714
in our heads in 30 years.

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.468
But what I can tell you

00:12:43.492 --> 00:12:45.667
is that we're not going
to make any progress

00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:49.418
towards understanding the human brain
or human diseases

00:12:49.442 --> 00:12:53.958
until we figure out how to get
at the electrical activity of neurons

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.182
in healthy humans.

00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:59.157
And almost no one is working
on figuring out how to do that today.
