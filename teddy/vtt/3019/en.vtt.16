00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:03.874
this technology enabled us to begin
studying neuroscience in individuals.

00:08:03.898 --> 00:08:08.128
So much like the transition to genetics,
at the single cell level,

00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:11.358
we started to study neuroscience,
at the single human level.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.508
But we weren't quite there yet.

00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:15.537
Because these technologies

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.617
were still restricted
to medical applications,

00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:22.032
which meant that we were studying
sick brains, not healthy brains.

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:26.989
Because no matter how safe
your technology is,

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.743
you can't stick something
into someone's brain

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:31.187
for research purposes.
