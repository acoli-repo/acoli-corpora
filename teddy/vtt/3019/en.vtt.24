00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:00.696
we had been treating
all those different diseases

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.903
with the same drug,

00:12:01.927 --> 00:12:05.141
just by giving people amphetamine,
basically is what we were doing.

00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:07.653
And schizophrenia and depression
are the same way.

00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:11.709
So rather than prescribing drugs to people
essentially at random,

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:12.883
as we had,

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:16.418
we learned how to predict
which drugs would be most effective

00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:17.625
in which patients,

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:20.405
and that just led to this huge
improvement in outcomes.

00:12:21.498 --> 00:12:24.974
OK, I want to bring you back now
to the year 2017.

00:12:26.117 --> 00:12:29.490
Some of this may sound satirical
or even far fetched.

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:30.807
And some of it is.
