00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:30.840
the only way that we knew of
to get through the skull

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.681
was to drill these holes
the size of quarters.

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:36.054
You would never let
someone do that to you.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:39.220
So in the 2020s,

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:42.625
people began to experiment --
rather than drilling these gigantic holes,

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.764
drilling microscopic holes,
no thicker than a piece of hair.

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:48.831
And the idea here
was really for diagnosis --

00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:51.641
there are lots of times in the diagnosis
of brain disorders

00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:56.537
when you would like to be able to look
at the neural activity beneath the skull

00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.752
and being able to drill
these microscopic holes

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.918
would make that much easier
for the patient.
