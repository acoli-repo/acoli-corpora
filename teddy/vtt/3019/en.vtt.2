00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.074
But this is a kind of general
problem in neuroscience.

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:02.488
So for example, take emotion.

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:04.971
Lots of people want to understand emotion.

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:08.665
But you can't study emotion
in mice or monkeys

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:09.943
because you can't ask them

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:12.284
how they're feeling
or what they're experiencing.

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:14.665
So instead, people who want
to understand emotion,

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.466
typically end up studying
what's called motivated behavior,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.148
which is code for "what the mouse does
when it really, really wants cheese."

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:23.514
OK, I could go on and on.

00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:29.854
I mean, the point is, the NIH
spends about 5.5 billion dollars a year

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:31.410
on neuroscience research.
