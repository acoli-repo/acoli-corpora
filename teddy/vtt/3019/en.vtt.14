00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:02.312
And the risk, whenever
you put something into the brain tissue,

00:07:02.336 --> 00:07:03.775
is essentially that of stroke.

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.995
That you would hit
a blood vessel and burst it,

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.538
and that causes a stroke.

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:11.641
So, by the mid 2030s,
we had invented these flexible probes

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.943
that were capable of going
around blood vessels,

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.443
rather than through them.

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:21.164
And thus, we could put
huge batteries of these probes

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:22.545
into the brains of patients

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.839
and record from thousands of their neurons
without any risk to them.

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:31.519
And what we discovered,
sort of to our surprise,
