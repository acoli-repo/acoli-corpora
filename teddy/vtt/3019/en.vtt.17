an electrical connection to the brain,

00:08:37.863 --> 00:08:40.307
you can use it to hook
the brain up to a computer.

00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:44.490
Oh, well, you know, the general public

(Laughter)

00:08:54.463 --> 00:08:58.963
Imagine being able to take
a picture with your eyes, OK?

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:00.217
(Laughter)
