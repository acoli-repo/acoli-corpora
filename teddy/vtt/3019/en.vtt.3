00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:31.410
on neuroscience research.

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:35.037
And yet there have been almost
no significant improvements in outcomes

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:38.552
for patients with brain diseases
in the past 40 years.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.555
And I think a lot of that
is basically due to the fact

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.730
that mice might be OK as a model
for cancer or diabetes,

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:48.441
but the mouse brain
is just not sophisticated enough

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:51.640
to reproduce human psychology
or human brain disease.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:53.604
OK?

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:57.262
So if the mouse models are so bad,
why are we still using them?

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:00.246
Well, it basically boils down to this:
