00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:33.491
And I know it might sound crazy,
using lasers to drill holes in your skull,

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:34.881
but back in 2017,

00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:39.014
people were OK with surgeons
shooting lasers into their eyes

00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:40.252
for corrective surgery

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:44.163
So when you're already here,
it's not that big of a step.

00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.712
OK?

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:50.307
So the next step,
that happened in the 2030s,

00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.417
was that it's not just about
getting through the skull.

00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:55.141
To measure the activity of neurons,

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.990
you have to actually make it
into the brain tissue itself.

00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:02.312
And the risk, whenever
you put something into the brain tissue,
