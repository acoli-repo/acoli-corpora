00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.068
In Parkinson's, there's one particular
kind of neuron deep in your brain

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:33.823
that is responsible for the disease,

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:37.029
and these technologies just don't have
the resolution that you need

00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:38.426
to get at that.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.424
And so that's why
we're still stuck with the animals.

00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:44.981
Not that anyone wants
to be studying depression

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.267
by putting mice into jars, right?

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:51.044
It's just that there's this pervasive
sense that it's not possible

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:54.915
to look at the activity of neurons
in healthy humans.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.672
So here's what I want to do.

00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:00.495
I want to take you into the future.
