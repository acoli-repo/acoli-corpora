00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.188
People started signing their emails,

00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:31.553
"Please excuse any typos.

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:32.910
Sent from my brain."

00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:33.935
(Laughter)

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.031
Commercial systems
popped up left and right,

00:09:36.055 --> 00:09:39.293
offering the latest and greatest
in neural interfacing technology.

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:41.545
There were 100 electrodes.

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:43.480
A thousand electrodes.

00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:45.980
High bandwidth for only 99.99 a month.

00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:47.543
(Laughter)

00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:49.101
Soon, everyone had them.

00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.265
And that was the key.

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:54.212
Because, in the 2050s,
if you were a neuroscientist,

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:58.175
you could have someone come into your lab
essentially from off the street.

00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:01.656
And you could have them engaged
in some emotional task
