00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.806
to stop the degenerative process
before it begins.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:02.962
So how did we do it?

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:06.136
Well, there were essentially three steps.

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.403
The first step was
that we had to figure out

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:12.720
some way to get electrical
connections through the skull

00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:15.759
so we could measure
the electrical activity of neurons.

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.688
And not only that,
it had to be easy and risk-free.

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:23.090
Something that basically anyone
would be OK with,

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.714
like getting a piercing.

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:27.903
Because back in 2017,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:30.840
the only way that we knew of
to get through the skull
