00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.903
So instead, we've invented
all these proxies.

00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:34.442
So the most popular one is probably this,

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:36.863
functional MRI, fMRI,

00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:39.579
which allows you to make these
pretty pictures like this,

00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:41.659
that show which parts
of your brain light up

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.809
when you're engaged
in different activities.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.753
But this is a proxy.

00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:49.069
You're not actually measuring
neural activity here.

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.935
What you're doing
is you're measuring, essentially,

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.791
like, blood flow in the brain.

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:55.053
Where there's more blood.

00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:58.180
It's actually where there's more oxygen,
but you get the idea, OK?

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.723
The other thing that you can do
is you can do this --
