00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:31.329
harbors over a hundred million
different cells.

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:33.729
While genetically similar,

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:36.462
there are small differences
in these different cancers

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:39.343
that make them differently prone
to different drugs.

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.795
So even if you have a drug
that's highly effective,

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.554
that kills almost all the cells,

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:46.768
there is a chance
that there's a small population

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.566
that's resistant to the drug.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.612
This ultimately is the population

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:51.800
that comes back,

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:53.142
and takes over the patient.

00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:56.746
So then the question is:
What do we do with this information?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.032
Well, the key, then,

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:02.926
is to apply all these exciting
advancements in cancer therapy earlier,
