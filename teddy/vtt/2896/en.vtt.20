00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.855
and eventually, it goes up higher
for days 400 and 450.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:03.847
Here's the key, if you've missed it:

00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:08.852
At day 340, we see the rise
in the cancer DNA in the blood.

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:13.092
That means we are catching this cancer
over a hundred days earlier

00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:14.593
than traditional methods.

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:17.914
This is a hundred days earlier
where we can give therapies,

00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:21.257
a hundred days earlier
where we can do surgical interventions,

00:10:21.281 --> 00:10:24.314
or even a hundred days less
for the cancer to grow

00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:27.460
or a hundred days less
for resistance to occur.

00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:32.857
For some patients, this hundred days
means the matter of life and death.
