00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.235
which then results in unnecessary work-ups
and unnecessary procedures.

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:36.286
Imaging methods,
while useful in some populations,

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.858
expose patients to harmful radiation.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.496
In addition, it is not applicable
to all patients.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.563
For example, mammography has problems
in women with dense breasts.

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.430
So what we need is a method
that is noninvasive,

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:52.221
that is light in infrastructure,

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:53.508
that is highly specific,

00:05:54.148 --> 00:05:57.369
that also does not have false positives,

00:05:57.393 --> 00:05:59.359
does not use any radiation

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:02.314
and is applicable to large populations.
