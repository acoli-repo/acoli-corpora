00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:31.217
Well, because there's no way
of really predicting right now

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.749
which patients will get cancer,

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.830
we use the next best population:

00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:36.876
cancers in remission;

00:08:37.552 --> 00:08:39.974
specifically, lung cancer.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:43.714
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs
that we have today,

00:08:43.738 --> 00:08:45.950
most lung cancers come back.

00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:47.274
The key, then, is to see

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:50.949
whether we're able to detect
these recurrences of cancers

00:08:50.973 --> 00:08:52.840
earlier than with standard methods.

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:55.716
We just finished a major trial

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.487
with Professor Charles Swanton
at University College London,

00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:00.677
examining this.
