00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:31.520
During this whole time,
we've been collecting blood serially

00:09:31.544 --> 00:09:34.822
to be able to measure
the amount of ctDNA in the blood.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.857
So at the initial time point, as expected,

00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:42.579
there's a high level
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:46.270
However, this goes away to zero
in subsequent time points

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.751
and remains negligible
after subsequent points.

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:56.266
However, around day 340, we see the rise
of cancer DNA in the blood,

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.855
and eventually, it goes up higher
for days 400 and 450.
