00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:04.102
Second is protein biomarkers,
like PSA for prostate cancer.

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:07.038
Or third, imaging techniques,

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:09.425
such as mammography for breast cancer.

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.845
Medical procedures are the gold standard;

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:14.965
however, they are highly invasive

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:17.794
and require a large
infrastructure to implement.

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:21.886
Protein markers, while effective
in some populations,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.399
are not very specific
in some circumstances,

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:27.006
resulting in high numbers
of false positives,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.235
which then results in unnecessary work-ups
and unnecessary procedures.
