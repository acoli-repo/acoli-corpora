providing oxygen
and nutrients to your cells,

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:33.624
and removing waste and carbon dioxide.

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.501
Here's a key biological insight:

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.503
Cancer cells grow and die
faster than normal cells,

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:40.723
and when they die,

00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:43.468
DNA is shed into the blood system.

00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:46.262
Since we know the signatures
of these cancer cells

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.990
from all the different cancer
genome sequencing projects,

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.055
we can look for those signals in the blood

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.251
to be able to detect these cancers early.

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.208
So instead of waiting for cancers
to be large enough to cause symptoms,

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:01.131
or for them to be dense enough
to show up on imaging,
