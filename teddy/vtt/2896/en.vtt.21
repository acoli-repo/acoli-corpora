For some patients, this hundred days

00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.740
We're really excited
about this information.

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:39.636
Because of this assignment,
we've done additional studies now

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.922
in other cancers,

00:10:40.946 --> 00:10:44.281
including breast cancer, lung cancer

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:45.526
and ovarian cancer,

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:50.418
and I can't wait to see how much earlier
we can find these cancers.

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:53.822
Ultimately, I have a dream,

00:10:54.394 --> 00:10:56.660
a dream of two vials of blood,

00:10:57.536 --> 00:11:01.401
and that, in the future, as part of all
of our standard physical exams,
