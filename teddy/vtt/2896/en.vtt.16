00:07:57.565 --> 00:08:02.255
and are able to digitize the DNA
into A's, C's, T's and G's

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.877
and have this final readout.

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:10.441
Ultimately, we have information
of billions of letters

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.475
that output from this run.

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:17.855
We then apply statistical
and computational methods

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:20.551
to be able to find
the small signal that's present,

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:24.231
indicative of the small amount
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.703
So does this actually work in patients?

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:31.217
Well, because there's no way
of really predicting right now
