00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:02.926
is to apply all these exciting
advancements in cancer therapy earlier,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.172
as soon as we can,

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.535
before these resistance clones emerge.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.589
The key to cancer and curing cancer
is early detection.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.108
And we intuitively know this.

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:17.218
Finding cancer early
results in better outcomes,

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:19.288
and the numbers show this as well.

00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:23.555
For example, in ovarian cancer,
if you detect cancer in stage four,

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.708
only 17 percent of the women
survive at five years.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:31.696
However, if you are able to detect
this cancer as early as stage one,
