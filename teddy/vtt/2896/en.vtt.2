breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:04.676
And since then, there have been
over 90 projects in 70 countries

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.290
all over the world,

00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:09.689
working to understand
the genetic basis of these diseases.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.767
Today, tens of thousands
of cancers are understood

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:15.086
down to exquisite molecular detail.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.502
The second revolution
is precision medicine,

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.930
also known as "personalized medicine."

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:24.531
Instead of one-size-fits-all methods
to be able to treat cancers,

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.210
there is a whole new class of drugs
that are able to target cancers

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.441
based on their unique genetic profile.
