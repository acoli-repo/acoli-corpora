While your body is mostly healthy cells,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.176
most of the DNA that's detected
will be from healthy cells.

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:38.901
However, there will be a small amount,
less than one percent,

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.657
that comes from the cancer cells.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:45.751
Then we use molecular biology methods
to be able to enrich this DNA

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:50.187
for areas of the genome which are known
to be associated with cancer,

00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.164
based on the information
from the cancer genomics projects.

00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:57.541
We're able to then put this DNA
into DNA-sequencing machines

00:07:57.565 --> 00:08:02.255
and are able to digitize the DNA
into A's, C's, T's and G's
