00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:31.696
However, if you are able to detect
this cancer as early as stage one,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.412
over 92 percent of women will survive.

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.728
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent
of women are detected at stage one,

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:45.324
whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,
are detected in stages three and four.

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:49.529
We desperately need
better detection mechanisms for cancers.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:54.331
The current best ways to screen cancer
fall into one of three categories.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.530
First is medical procedures,

00:04:56.554 --> 00:04:59.462
which is like colonoscopy
for colon cancer.

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:04.102
Second is protein biomarkers,
like PSA for prostate cancer.
