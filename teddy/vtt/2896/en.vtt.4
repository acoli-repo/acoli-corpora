00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:01.496
and new drugs have been able
to turn the immune system back on,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.108
to be able to fight cancer.

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:07.223
In addition, there are ways
where you can take away immune cells

00:02:07.247 --> 00:02:08.407
from the body,

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.518
train them, engineer them
and put them back into the body

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:12.919
to fight cancer.

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.621
Almost sounds like
science fiction, doesn't it?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.106
While I was a researcher
at the National Cancer Institute,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.585
I had the privilege of working
with some of the pioneers of this field

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.855
and watched the development firsthand.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.322
It's been pretty amazing.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.351
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:33.560
actively recruiting patients
to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.
