00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.021
In fact, we lie at the intersection

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:35.234
of the three of the most exciting
developments within cancer research.

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.543
The first is cancer genomics.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.592
The genome is a composition

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:42.552
of all the genetic information
encoded by DNA

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:43.943
in an organism.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.808
In cancers, changes
in the DNA called mutations

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.634
are what drive these cancers
to go out of control.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.362
Around 10 years ago,
I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.984
that first mapped
the mutations of cancers.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.194
We did this first for colorectal,

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:00.744
breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.
