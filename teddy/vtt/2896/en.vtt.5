actively recruiting patients
to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:37.725
While these three exciting
revolutions are ongoing,

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.773
unfortunately, this is only the beginning,

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:43.008
and there are still many, many challenges.

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:44.781
Let me illustrate with a patient.

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.112
Here is a patient
with a skin cancer called melanoma.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.183
It's horrible; the cancer
has gone everywhere.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.926
However, scientists were able
to map the mutations of this cancer

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.006
and give a specific treatment
that targets one of the mutations.
