or for them to be dense enough
to show up on imaging,

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.597
or for them to be prominent enough

00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.861
for you to be able to visualize
on medical procedures,

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.877
we can start looking for cancers
while they are relatively pretty small,

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:14.505
by looking for these small amounts
of DNA in the blood.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:17.490
So let me tell you how we do this.

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:20.378
First, like I said, we start off
with a simple blood test --

00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:22.977
no radiation, no complicated equipment --

00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.467
a simple blood test.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.027
Then the blood is shipped to us,

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:28.440
and what we do
is extract the DNA out of it.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.506
While your body is mostly healthy cells,
