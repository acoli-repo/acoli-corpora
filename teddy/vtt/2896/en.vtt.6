00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.006
and give a specific treatment
that targets one of the mutations.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.403
And the result is almost miraculous.

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:06.873
Tumors almost seem to melt away.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.422
Unfortunately, this is not
the end of the story.

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:13.556
A few months later, this picture is taken.

00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:15.644
The tumor has come back.

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:18.207
The question is: Why?

00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:21.324
The answer is tumor heterogeneity.

00:03:22.107 --> 00:03:23.356
Let me explain.

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:28.612
Even a cancer as small
as one centimeter in diameter

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:31.329
harbors over a hundred million
different cells.
