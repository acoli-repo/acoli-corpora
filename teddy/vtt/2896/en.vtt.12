and is applicable to large populations.

00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:03.512
Even more importantly,

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.732
we need a method
to be able to detect cancers

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:08.448
before they're 100 million cells in size.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.625
Does such a technology exist?

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.929
Well, I wouldn't be up here
giving a talk if it didn't.

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:18.373
I'm excited to tell you about
this latest technology we've developed.

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:21.917
Central to our technology
is a simple blood test.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:26.112
The blood circulatory system,
while seemingly mundane,

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.466
is essential for you to survive,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.995
providing oxygen
and nutrients to your cells,
