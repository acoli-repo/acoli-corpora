And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It increases income, improves welfare, etc.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
with 3.5 million subscribers,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
115,000 of these phones I talked about --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.
