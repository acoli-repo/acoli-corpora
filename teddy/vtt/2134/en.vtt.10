00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So I had another unproductive day.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I put those two experiences together side by side,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So naturally, I -- the implication of that is

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
