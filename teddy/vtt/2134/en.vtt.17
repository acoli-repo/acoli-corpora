00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And that leads to specialization.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
That leads to productivity.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So the question was, I started looking at this issue,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There were a lot of reasons people told me

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
why we don't have enough telephones.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And one of them is the lacking buying power.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I mean, in America, people buy cars,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and they put very little money down.
