00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
just like I wasted a day.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is their days are the same length: 24 hours.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So if you lose that precious resource,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that's a huge waste.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So I started looking for any evidence that --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
does connectivity really increase productivity?
