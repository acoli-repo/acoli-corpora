And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to see whether it's contributing or --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And by and large, this has failed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And you can see this book,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.
