00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And again, here are some of the lessons.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
"The government needs to provide economically viable services."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
"Governments need to subsidize private companies."

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is what some people think.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And actually, private companies help governments with taxes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
"Poor people are recipients."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Poor people are a resource.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
"Services cost too much for the poor."

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Their involvement reduces the cost.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
