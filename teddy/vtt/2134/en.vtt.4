00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where citizens were empowered by technologies.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And they demanded authorities from --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to come down from their high horses.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And in the end, there's better bargaining

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
between the authorities and citizens,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so you can see, the real process of --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and this is backed up by this 500-page book --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that the authorities came down and citizens got up.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But if you look, if you have that perspective,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.
