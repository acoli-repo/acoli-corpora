00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we could update each other more often.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But one time it broke down.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And it reminded me of a day in 1971.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There was a war going on in my country.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to a remote rural area where it was safer.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.
