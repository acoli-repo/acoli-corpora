And that is the real network effect.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so that their voices are heard,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so then things would improve.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the World Bank, is an organization of the government,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
by the government, for the governments.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Just see the contrast.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Of course, how would you empower citizens?
