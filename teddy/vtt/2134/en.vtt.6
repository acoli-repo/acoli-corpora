00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
their hands, legs, brains, what have you.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is to recognize that economic development is of the people,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
by the people, for the people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And that is the real network effect.
