00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
which is on the vertical axis, is very little.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The question was,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It turns out: 2,000 dollars.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So obviously this was a gadget to have.
