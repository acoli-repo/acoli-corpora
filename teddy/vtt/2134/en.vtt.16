And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is if we can connect with each other.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But in order to expand that, you need a river,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And that leads to specialization.
