that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And if that's the case, then the question is

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
how many telephones did we have at that time?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for every 500 people.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And all those phones were in the few urban places.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
there were no telephones.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
just like I wasted a day.
