00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I created a company in America called Gonofone,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which in Bengali means "people's phone."

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And angel investors in America put in money into that.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I flew around the world.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
After about a million miles, and a meaningful --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
which involved the Norwegian telephone company,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
which provided the know-how,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
