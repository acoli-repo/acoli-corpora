00:09:59.414 --> 00:10:01.243
but they'll never get the same support

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.432
that we give national hunger-fighting
organizations and food banks.

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:06.241
But, if given the opportunity,

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:08.675
they have the ability to foster insight

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:10.599
and perhaps be forward-thinking enough

00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:12.041
to solve this problem.

00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:13.693
That's why I'm traveling the world

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:16.693
and I'm really talking about
what hunger looks like in America

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:19.912
and explaining the difference between
giving people access to food

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.363
and access to meals.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.421
I've been meeting
with city council members

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:25.583
and city organizers across the US

00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:28.929
and telling them that technology
indeed does have the power

00:10:28.953 --> 00:10:31.129
to connect businesses with surplus food
