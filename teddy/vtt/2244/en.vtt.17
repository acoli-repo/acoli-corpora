Their shelves remain stocked
by recovering excess food

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.008
from major supermarkets

00:08:35.032 --> 00:08:37.766
and allowing families
to simply pay what they can

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.477
at their grocery store.

00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.167
This is amazing.

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:44.149

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.168
Everyone can take on the roles

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:50.001

00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:57.775
to how we view our entertainment

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:59.436
to how we even receive food,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.321
it's amazing that we haven't
solved hunger yet.
