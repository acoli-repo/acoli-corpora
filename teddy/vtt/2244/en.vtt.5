00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.595
So I've invested in this fight
for quite some time.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.875
In almost every major US city,

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.693
the food bank is viewed
as a beloved community institution.

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:41.457
Corporations send volunteers down
on a weekly basis

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:44.892
to sort through food items
and make boxes of food for the needy.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.471
And can drives --

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:50.273
they warm the hearts of schools
and office buildings that participate

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:54.134
and fill the shelves of food banks
and food pantries across the nation.

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:55.988
This is how we work to end hunger.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.267
And what I've come to realize

00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.969
is that we are doing hunger wrong.
