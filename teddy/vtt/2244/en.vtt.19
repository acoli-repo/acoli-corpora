00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.975
and one of them said to me,
in true seriousness,

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:33.981
"Hunger is already being solved,"

00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:37.576
as if millions of people weren't going
to go to bed hungry that very night,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.518
and as if there was nothing else to do.

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.697
And the reality is,

00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:42.821
one would think
that hunger is being solved,

00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:45.010
but the truth is, it's being worked on.

00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.661
If we really want to solve hunger,

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:49.122
then we have to change
the way we've been doing it.

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:52.386
The same actions will always
garner the same results.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.352
There are hundreds of social
entrepreneurs all over the world.

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:59.390
They have a focus to solve
really big problems, like hunger,

00:09:59.414 --> 00:10:01.243
but they'll never get the same support
