00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:02.085
We are doing the same things

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.148
over and over and over again

00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:07.210

00:03:13.337 --> 00:03:15.559
for food that is often not well-balanced

00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:18.343

We're educating the world

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.172
There are television commercials,
