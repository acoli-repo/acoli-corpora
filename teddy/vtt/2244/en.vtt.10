00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:01.460
and I thought surely we can
reverse-engineer this technology

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.846
and get food from businesses
like restaurants and grocery stores

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.200
and into the hands of people in need.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.438
I believe that technology and innovation

00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:11.595
have the power to solve real problems,

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:12.931
especially hunger.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.660
So in 2017, I created an app

00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:19.267
that would inventory everything
that a business sells

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:22.073
and make it super easy for them
to donate this excess food

00:05:22.097 --> 00:05:24.782
that would typically go to waste
at the end of the night.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.301
All the user has to do now
is click on an item,

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:29.215
tell us how many they have to donate,

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:31.872
and our platform calculates
the weight and the tax value
