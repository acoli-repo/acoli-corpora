it's amazing that we haven't
solved hunger yet.

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:05.019
We literally have cars
that can drive themselves

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:07.634

00:09:08.142 --> 00:09:11.459
With millions of dollars being donated

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.438
I remember meeting with investors
and pitching the idea,

00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:29.416
trying to raise funds for my business,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.975
and one of them said to me,
in true seriousness,
