00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:02.802
We give every family reusable grocery bags
and allow them to simply shop

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:04.464
minus the price tag.

00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:07.572
We wanted to give people access to meals

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:09.018
and not just food.

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:13.036
We wanted to change the way that we think
and work to solve hunger in this country,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.265
get people to believe
that we can solve hunger,

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.606
not as a nonprofit,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.884
not as a food bank

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:19.510
but as a social enterprise,

00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:22.402
with the goal of reducing waste
and ending hunger.

00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:24.354
But it hasn't been as easy as I thought

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.625
to change the narrative
and the thought process

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.910
on how we think that hunger can be solved.

00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:32.544
In 2016, France became the first country
