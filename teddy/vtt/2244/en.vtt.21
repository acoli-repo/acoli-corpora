00:10:28.953 --> 00:10:31.129
to connect businesses with surplus food

00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:32.408
to people in need,

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.866
and explaining to them
what a meal can actually mean to a family.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.595
I've been meeting with school boards
and school districts

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:40.665
to talk about how we feed hungry children,

00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:42.155
and health care organizations,

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:44.167
sharing the message that food is health,

00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.561
and food is life,

00:10:45.585 --> 00:10:49.008
and that, by solving hunger,
we can solve so many more problems.

00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:50.980
So if we want to know

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:52.845
that we don't live in a nation

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:54.999
where perfectly good food goes to waste

00:10:55.023 --> 00:10:57.283
when our neighbors don't have food to eat,

00:10:57.307 --> 00:10:59.352
then we need to change the laws.

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.369
We need to introduce new policies,
