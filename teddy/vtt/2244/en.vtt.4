00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:00.078
I've collected cans since I was a kid,

00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:03.207
I've donated in the grocery store
more times than I can count,

00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.482
I've volunteered at shelters,
I've worked in food pantries,

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:09.035
and I'm sure, like me,
so many of you have, too.

00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:13.252
In 2013, I even created
a pop-up restaurant,

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:14.696
called Sunday Soul.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.979
And I rented tables and chairs and linens

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.517
and I printed out menus

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:21.042
and I took these experiences to alleyways,

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.137
underneath bridges and in parks

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:25.893
to allow people that were
experiencing homelessness

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.373
to dine with dignity.

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.595
So I've invested in this fight
for quite some time.
