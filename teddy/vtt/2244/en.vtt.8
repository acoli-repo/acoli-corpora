00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.472
that go to bed hungry every night.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.604
Yet, we're wasting more food
than ever before --

00:04:03.628 --> 00:04:05.565
more than 80 billion pounds a year,

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.921
to be exact.

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:10.472
The EPA estimates that food waste
has more than doubled

00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:13.895
between 1970 and 2017,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.604
and now accounts for 27 percent
of everything in our landfills.

00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:20.185
And as this food sits,
it gradually rots

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.110
and produces harmful methane gas,

00:04:22.134 --> 00:04:24.617
a leading contributor
to global climate change.

00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.999
We have the waste of the food itself,

00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:31.327
the waste of all the money associated
with producing this now-wasted food
