00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:34.485
This has accounted
for about 1.7 million meals

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.671
and allowed us to start to expand
our efforts to other cities,

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:41.726
like Washington, DC, Chicago,
Miami, Philadelphia and more.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.707
That's just one approach
that actually tackles the problem.

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:47.498
Another was the launch
of our pop-up grocery stores.

00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:49.898
We recover excess food from businesses

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:53.636
and set up free community grocery stores
right in the middle of food deserts.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.946
We bring out a chef,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.151
and we do on-site taste-testings and allow
families to leave with recipe cards.

00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:02.802
We give every family reusable grocery bags
and allow them to simply shop
