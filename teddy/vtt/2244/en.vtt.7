00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.172
There are television commercials,

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:32.362
billboards,

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:33.669
massive donations,

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:36.719
the engagement of some
of our biggest celebrities in the fight.

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:39.018
But the ever-present reality is that,

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.659
even with all of this work,

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.881
millions of people are still going hungry.

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.226
And we can do better.

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:47.653
Globally, 821 million people are hungry.

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:50.503
That's one in nine people on this planet.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.569
And here in the United States,

00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:55.927
nearly 40 million people
experience hunger every single year,

00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.439
including more than 11 million children

00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.472
that go to bed hungry every night.
