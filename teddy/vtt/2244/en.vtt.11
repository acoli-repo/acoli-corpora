00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:31.872
and our platform calculates
the weight and the tax value

00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:33.730
of those items at time of donation.

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:36.458
We then connect with local drivers
in the shared economy

to get this food picked up
and delivered directly to the doors

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.024
of nonprofit organizations

I provided the data and the analytics

00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:46.908

on a regular basis,

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.790

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.487
feed more, waste less.

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:01.152

the world's busiest airport,
