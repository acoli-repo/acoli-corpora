In June of 2017,

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:06.837
I volunteered with a group
at a local food pantry

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.486
on the south side of my home city

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.949
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:12.933
It was a Friday afternoon,

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:15.185
the day of their weekly food giveaway.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.368
And as I drove up,

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:18.366
I saw people beginning to arrive,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.312
many with their rolling carts in tow,

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:23.094
prepared to receive
their food supply for the week.

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:26.134
As I was walking in the door,
there were about 40 people outside

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.347
waiting in line.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:28.821
And I was so excited,

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.219
because there are very few things
I enjoy more than giving back.
