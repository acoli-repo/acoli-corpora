00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:31.327
the waste of all the money associated
with producing this now-wasted food

00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:34.062
and the waste of labor
with all of the above.

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.003
And then there's the social inequity

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:39.402
between people who really
need food and can't get it

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:42.290
and people who have too much
and simply throw it away.

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:46.956
All of this made me realize
that hunger was not an issue of scarcity

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.182
but rather a matter of logistics.

00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:53.585
So in 2017, I set out
to end hunger using technology.

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:57.949
After all, food delivery apps
had begun to explode on the scene,

00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:01.460
and I thought surely we can
reverse-engineer this technology
