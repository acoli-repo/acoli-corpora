00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:32.544
In 2016, France became the first country

00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:35.973
to ban supermarkets
from throwing away unused food.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.696
Instead, they must donate it,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.657
and they're fined if they don't.

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.837
Yes.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.139
(Applause)

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.883
In 2017, Italy followed suit,

00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:48.852
becoming the second European nation

00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:51.160
to pass an anti-food-waste ban.

00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:54.456
And they stated it so simply
as it was passed through legislation:

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.767
"We have millions of pounds
of good food going to waste,

00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.044
and we have poor people
that are going hungry."
