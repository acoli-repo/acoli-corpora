00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:30.953
We made over a hundred
of those bags that day,

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:33.579
and people indeed
stood in line to receive one.

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.802

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.781
I've been part
of this process all my life.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:57.788
I've participated in food drives,

00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:00.078
