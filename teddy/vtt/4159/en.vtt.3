00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:33.815
So we're proposing a strategy
which is four days of work

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.056
and then 10 days of lockdown,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.374
and the next two weeks, again:
four days of work, 10 days of lockdown.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.731
And that way, if a person
gets infected at work,

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:46.409
they reach their peak infectiousness
during lockdown, and that way,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.737
they avoid infecting many others.

00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:52.488
This restricts the viral transmission.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.066
Also, just working four days
out of two weeks

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.399
restricts the amount of time
the virus gets to see many other people,

00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:00.066
and that's a very powerful effect.
