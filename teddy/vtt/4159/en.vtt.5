UA: That's correct.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.105
So you're infected on the subway,

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.369
and so for the first three days or so,
you're in your latent period,

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:37.948
you don't infect your coworkers,

00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:40.733
you reach your peak
infectiousness at home,

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:43.086
there will be secondary
infections at home,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.686
and people with symptoms
can self-quarantine,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.383
and over the long run, you have
a reproduction number less than one,

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:53.121
so the epidemic,
if you continue these cycles,

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:55.304
will go away.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.174
CA: I mean, is it frustrating
