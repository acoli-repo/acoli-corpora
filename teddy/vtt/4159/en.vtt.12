there's a lot of productivity
that can happen when you're at home,

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:03.917
so you could picture on this idea
of people doing one set of things

00:06:03.941 --> 00:06:06.738
during the four days when they're,
say, back at the office,

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:11.337
doing the exposure to each other,
sparking off each other,

00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.944
the discussions, the brainstorming,
all that good stuff,

00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:18.134
while at home, they're then
doing all the things

00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:20.077
that we've been doing
the last few weeks,

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:22.130
kind of working solo.

00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:24.288
How much have you thought about how that,

00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:28.701
whether it's possible, effectively,
to divide work into different types

00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.978
and actually use a strategy like this
