Uri Alon: Thank you.
Nice to be here again.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:35.866
CA: It's great to see you again.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.596
So, I guess the key to your idea

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.755
is this obsession with
the reproduction number R, R-naught.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:46.288
If that number is less than one,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.870
then fewer than one person
is infected by a typical person,

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:53.633
and eventually, the epidemic fades away.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.928
People are worried that
as we come back to work,

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.885
R will shoot up above one again.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.330
You have a suggestion
for how we might avoid that.
