Chris Anderson: So our first speaker
gave a TED Talk at TEDGlobal

00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:06.388
I think seven years ago.

00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:09.353
His name is Professor Uri Alon,

00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:12.034
at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:16.397
Now, he and his colleagues there
have come up with a powerful idea

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.415
that addresses this key question:

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.641
How on earth do we get back to work

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:25.458
without creating a second surge
of the infection?

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:29.353
Uri Alon, welcome to TED.
