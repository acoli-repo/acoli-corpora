00:11:57.005 --> 00:12:01.352
there's people with low income,
that just can't adhere to lockdown

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:03.053
because they have to make a living.

00:12:03.077 --> 00:12:08.722
And studies show that mobility
[among] people in the low-income sectors

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:10.254
is larger during lockdown.

00:12:10.278 --> 00:12:14.024
And also, in developing countries,
people just have to go out of the house.

00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:15.567
You can't enforce lockdown.

00:12:15.591 --> 00:12:21.280
So this four-10 kind of strategy can
actually make lockdown easier to bear

00:12:21.304 --> 00:12:24.668
for people who can still
make a living during those days,

00:12:24.692 --> 00:12:26.884
or at least make their own choices

00:12:26.908 --> 00:12:30.337
about what fraction to work
and what fraction to stay in lockdown.
