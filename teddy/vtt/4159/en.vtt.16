Me and my partner,
with different personalities,

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:02.939
we both teach in universities,

00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:04.604
and teaching through this

00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:07.460
has [helped me] become
productive in certain ways.

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:09.376

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.340
and I think harnessing the creativity
of people at workplaces,

00:08:13.364 --> 00:08:17.295
we're only at the beginning
of what these kinds of mixtures can offer.

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:21.386

on the front line,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.824
again, if you're delivering
goods and so forth

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:29.007
and you can't do that virtually,

00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.457
is there any thought about
