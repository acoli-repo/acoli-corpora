00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.516
and once you have
a predictable schedule

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.696
of four days at work,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.431
you can work longer hours,

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.936
you can design shifts
and get higher productivity

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.636
by prioritizing in those four days

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.482
much more than 40 percent of the workdays.

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:46.239
CA: Yes, so talk through
how that could work.

00:04:46.263 --> 00:04:49.984
I mean, let's imagine,
first of all, manufacturing,

00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:52.018
which is currently shut down.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:56.721
Is the implication here
that a manufacturer could set up

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:59.918
two, possibly even three,
shifts of four days,

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:04.601
maybe 35 hours or something of work
over those four days
