00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:04.601
maybe 35 hours or something of work
over those four days

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:09.054
and still get a lot of productivity,

00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:12.607
basically, having the lines
almost running continuously that way?

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.569
UA: Exactly.

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:18.041
So this is a staggered
version of this idea,

00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:22.099
where you take the population,
divide it into two groups or three groups.

00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:26.267
Let's say one group works four days
and then 10 days of lockdown.

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.568
Then the other group kicks in.

00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:32.173
This idea was proposed by colleagues
at Bar-Ilan University.
