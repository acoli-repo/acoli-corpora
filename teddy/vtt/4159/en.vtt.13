00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.978
and actually use a strategy like this

00:06:31.002 --> 00:06:34.247
to maintain almost full
or even better productivity?

00:06:34.898 --> 00:06:38.274
UA: I agree -- for many sectors,
people work at home very effectively,

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:40.194
and we've heard from several industries

00:06:40.218 --> 00:06:43.192
that productivity actually
went up during lockdown

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:44.604
and people working at home.

00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:47.253
So if you have a schedule,
a [cyclic exit strategy]

00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:48.945
you can restrict the amount,

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.200
or you can plan the work
where you need to be together

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:54.235
in a very effective way

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.971
with avoiding a lot of time lost,

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:59.404
if the person's work
can be more effective at home

00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:01.951
and more effective at work
and get high productivity.
