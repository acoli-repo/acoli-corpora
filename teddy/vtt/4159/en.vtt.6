00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.174
CA: I mean, is it frustrating

00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:03.298
at the thought that people
are going to say,

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:05.539
"Wait -- I don't want
to infect people at home,

00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:07.779
I'd rather infect people
at work than at home."

00:03:07.803 --> 00:03:09.987
What's the response to that?

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.189
UA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:13.134
So we have to consider the alternatives.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:15.654
If you open up the economy
and there's a second wave,

00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:19.271
you'll get all those infections anyway
during the lockdown that happens,

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:22.466
along with the devastating effects
on the economy, etc.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.484
And so, in the long run,

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:26.313
if you do a cyclic strategy like this

00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:29.655
but with a reproduction
number that's less than one,

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:34.100
you avoid, at least with these
mathematical models and considerations,
