00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:34.417
on the days that their kids are at school,
and you'd have to try --

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:35.603
UA: Absolutely.

00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:38.227
CA: I mean, is the best
instantiation of this

00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:41.114
that countries literally divide households

00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:45.283
into different A and B categories,
or something like that,

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:48.196
so that that kind
of alignment could happen?

00:10:49.173 --> 00:10:50.334
UA: Exactly.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:53.509
So you can align different
households, Group A and Group B,

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:56.328
and then the children go to school,
the parents go to work

00:10:56.352 --> 00:10:57.739
in a synchronized way,

00:10:57.763 --> 00:11:01.153
and the other group,
let's say, the alternating weeks.
