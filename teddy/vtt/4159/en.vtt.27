00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:30.832
and in that case, it's clear
that a second wave and another lockdown

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:35.492
will have worse consequences on health

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:38.867
than a cycle of four-10.

00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:44.268
And so it's really a question of
what you're comparing to.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.542
DB: Sure.

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:51.199
Well, thank you so much
for sharing this idea, Uri.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.505
CA: Indeed.

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:56.680
David, stay on.

00:13:56.704 --> 00:13:58.235
But just before you go:

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:03.128
Have any governments
expressed interest in exploring this?
