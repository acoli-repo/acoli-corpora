00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.847
are going to be infectious anyway,

00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.217
so that's the plan, but um --

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.189
UA: That's right.

00:04:06.832 --> 00:04:09.537
CA: Tell me this, though --
because four days out of 14,

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:11.646
someone's going to say, "Well, great idea,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.023
but that implies, like,
a 70 percent loss of productivity

00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.238
in the economy,

00:04:16.262 --> 00:04:18.091
so that can't possibly work."

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:20.194
I think you think that
the productivity loss

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.268
need not be anything like that much.

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.313
UA: That's right,

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:26.582
and of course, most people
don't work weekends,

00:04:26.606 --> 00:04:29.396
so it's four days out of
the 10 work days in the two weeks,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.516
and once you have
a predictable schedule
