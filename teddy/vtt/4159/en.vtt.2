00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.330
You have a suggestion
for how we might avoid that.

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.249
What is that suggestion?

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:06.267
UA: Exactly.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.088
So, we are suggesting a strategy

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:12.550
that's based on a weak spot
based on the biology of the virus,

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:15.504
which is a cycle of work and lockdown.

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:21.026
It exploits the vulnerability of the virus
in that, when a person gets infected,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.111
they're not infectious
for about three days.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:26.592
So you don't infect others
for the first three days,

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:29.316
and after another two days,
on average, you get symptoms.
