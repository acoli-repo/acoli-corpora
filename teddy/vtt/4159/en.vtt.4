00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:00.066
and that's a very powerful effect.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.128
So everybody works on the same four days,

00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:04.336
kids go to school on the same four days,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.047
with all the measures
of social distancing and masks, etc,

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.115
and then there's a lockdown period.

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:14.893
CA: So if you take
the worst-case scenario,

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:18.479
where you come to work on a Monday morning
at the start of your four days,

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:22.155
and you're infected on the subway,
say, on the way to work,

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.645
the theory here is that even
by the end of that four days,

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.174
you're not really starting
to infect your coworkers?
