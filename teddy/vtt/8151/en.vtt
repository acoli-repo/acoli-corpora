00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:03.332
It sounds simple,

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:06.169
just power your business
with 100 percent renewable energy.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:07.462
But the detail that goes in

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:09.547
and the industry expertise that's required

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.675
to really understand not just how much
energy you're consuming

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:14.635
across different parts of your business,

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:17.263
but also what's the best
and most cost-effective way

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.475
to drive new wind and solar
to the grids around the world.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.144
It's complicated, and not everybody
has the opportunity

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.521
to build an internal team
of energy experts.

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:28.066
It really comes back
to the opportunity to partner.
