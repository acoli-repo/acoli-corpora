00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.317
We have some good reasons to completely

00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:11.235
switch over to solar power.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:12.859
It's cheaper in many cases,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.809
and definitely more sustainable

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.213
than our dependance on traditional power plants

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:18.906
that use resources like coal,

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:20.950
which will eventually run out.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.035
So why don't we replace these

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.570
traditional plants with solar energy?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.027
Because there's one factor that makes

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:28.476
solar power very unpredictable:

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:30.052
cloud cover.
