00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here to share my photography.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Or is it photography?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because, of course, this is a photograph

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that you can't take with your camera.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yet, my interest in photography started

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as I got my first digital camera

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
at the age of 15.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but it was a bit different,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because using the camera,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the process was in the planning instead.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And when you take a photograph with a camera,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the process ends when you press the trigger.
