I have two questions for you.

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:14.273
One: whose shoulders
do you stand on?

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:18.443
And two: what do 
you stand for?

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:22.313
These are two questions that I always 
begin my poetry workshops with students

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:26.013
because at times, poetry can seem 
like this dead art form

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:30.293
for old white men who just 
seem like they were born to be old,
