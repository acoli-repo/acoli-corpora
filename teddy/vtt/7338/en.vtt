00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:09.121
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut.

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.871
A cannonball sewn 
into a soldierâ€™s uniform.

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.246
And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:19.663
These old items were all
intended treatments

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.913
for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia:

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.246
snoring.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:29.163
It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous.

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:33.662
So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem?
