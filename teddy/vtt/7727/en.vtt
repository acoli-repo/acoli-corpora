00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:02.666
I'm going to tell you a true story,

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:04.701
but instead of the name
of the protagonist,

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:06.336
think about your favorite artist.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.071
Think about your favorite musician,

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.707
and think about your favorite
song by that musician.

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.112
Think about them bringing that song
from nothing to something into your ears

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:16.547
and bringing you so much joy.

00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:20.117
Now think about your favorite musician
getting sued, and that lawyer saying,

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:21.285
"I represent this group.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:23.921
I think you heard their song
and then you wrote yours.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.389
You violated their copyright."

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:27.925
And imagine your musician saying,
"No, it's not true.

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:29.893
I don't think I've ever heard that song.

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:31.094
But even if I did,
