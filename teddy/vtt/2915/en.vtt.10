00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.696
by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.016
People are always there or dropping by.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.160
They are never left
to live solitary lives.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.296
This is unlike the rest
of the developed world,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.776
where as George Burns quipped,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840

loving, caring family in another city."

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.976

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.416
Now, so far we've only met men,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.536
long-living men, but I met women too,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.160
and here you see Zia Teresa.
