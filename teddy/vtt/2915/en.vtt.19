00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.656
one hour more than last year, by the way,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.496
does it make a difference?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.536
Why distinguish
between interacting in person

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.776
and interacting via social media?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.656
Is it the same thing as being there

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.360
if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.336
Well, the short answer
to the question is no,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.016
it's not the same thing.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.856
Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.176
and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.056
and well into the future.
