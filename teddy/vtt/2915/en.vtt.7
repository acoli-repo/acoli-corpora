He was a happy-go-lucky guy,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.936

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.496
And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.720
thinking positively?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.216
Actually, no.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.800
(Laughter)

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.456
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.496
the grumpiest person I have ever met.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.016
(Laughter)

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.736
And he put a lie to the notion

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.320
that you have to be positive
to live a long life.
