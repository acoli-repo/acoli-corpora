00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.456
Now, a third of the population says

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080
they have two or fewer people to lean on.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.736
But let's go to Villagrande

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.816
to meet some centenarians.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.736
Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.816

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.496
during not one but two world wars,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.616
how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,
