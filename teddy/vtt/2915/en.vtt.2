It's the only place
where men live as long as women.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.456
But why?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.120
My curiosity was piqued.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.056
I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.496
and I started with the genetic profile.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.576
I discovered soon enough

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.616
that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.160
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.760
So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.760
What are they doing right?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.656
What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.216
It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone
