We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.016
like FaceTime, things like that.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.296
Does that work too?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.576
I mean, I see my nephew.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.016
He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.056
It seems like he's connecting pretty well.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.856
Is that useful? Is that helpful?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.216
Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.976
and the health data trailed behind.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.376
So we're just learning,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.416
but I would say
there are some improvements

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.256
that we could make in the technology.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.736
For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.816
so for example, when you're
looking into the screen,
