00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.600
Here's an intriguing fact.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.016
In the developed world,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.200
everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.136
Six to eight years longer.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.040
That's, like, a huge gap.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.696
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.176
showing that men in rich countries

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.176
are twice as likely to die as women are

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.400
at any age.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.976
But there is one place in the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
where men live as long as women.
