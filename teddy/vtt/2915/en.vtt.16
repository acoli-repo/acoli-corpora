and getting towards the top predictors

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.736

First, your close relationships.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.456
These are the people
that you can call on for a loan

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.096
if you need money suddenly,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.696
who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.536
or who will take you to the hospital,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.376
or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.376
if you're in despair.
