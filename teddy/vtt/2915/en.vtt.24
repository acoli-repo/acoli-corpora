00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.656
thought that the candidates were smarter

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.160
when they heard their voices

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.416
compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.856
or an email or a letter.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.656
Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.696
It shows that we're thinking, feeling,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.376
sentient human beings

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.896
who are much more than an algorithm.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.976
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.280
at the University of Chicago
Business School

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.120
is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.816
If somebody hears your voice,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.160
they think you're smarter.
