00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.256
in a dynamic conversation,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.776
and she compared that
to the brain activity of people

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.536
who were watching her talk
about the same subject

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.040
but in a canned video, like on YouTube.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.576
And by the way, if you want to know

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.416
how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.640
talk to me later.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.760
So what's the difference?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.000
This is your brain
on real social interaction.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.736
What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.896
between interacting in person
and taking in static content.
