00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.416
Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.816
because it's only in third place.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.336
How much exercise you get is next,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.696
still only a moderate predictor.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.456
Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.016
getting higher now.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.656

Did anybody here know

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.760
that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.216
Whether you were drinking and quit,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.216
or whether you're a moderate drinker,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.720
whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit,
