00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.616
how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.976
raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.200
where I interviewed him.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.576
Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.656
both in their 70s
and looking after their father,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.936
and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.696
who came along with me
on this research trip,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.536
because the flip side of social cohesion

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.376
is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.296
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.256
He was a happy-go-lucky guy,
