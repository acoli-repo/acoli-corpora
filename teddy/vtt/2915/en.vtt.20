00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.056
and well into the future.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.600
So simply making
eye contact with somebody,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.176
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.256
is enough to release oxytocin,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.496
which increases your level of trust

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.360
and it lowers your cortisol levels.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.760
So it lowers your stress.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.256
And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.496
and it kills pain.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.440
It's like a naturally produced morphine.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.856
Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.560
which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing.
