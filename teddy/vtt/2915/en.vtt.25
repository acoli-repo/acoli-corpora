00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.160
they think you're smarter.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.920
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.240
Now, to return to the beginning,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.936
why do women live longer than men?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.296
And one major reason
is that women are more likely

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.696
to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.376
over their lifespans.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.056
Fresh evidence shows

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.776
that these in-person friendships

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.776
create a biological force field
against disease and decline.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.976
And it's not just true of humans

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.376
but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.
