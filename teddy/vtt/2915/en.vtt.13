Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.656
and she addressed this very question

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.176
in a series of studies

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.096
of tens of thousands of middle aged people

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.256
much like this audience here.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.216
And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle:

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.376
their diet, their exercise,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.896
their marital status,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.576
how often they went to the doctor,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.096
whether they smoked or drank, etc.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.336
She recorded all of this

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.936
and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.680
to see who would still be breathing.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.880
And of the people left standing,
