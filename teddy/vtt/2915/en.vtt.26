00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.376
but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.056
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.976
who have a core of female friends

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.576
show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.080
they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.016
At least three stable relationships.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.536
That was the magic number.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.776
Think about it.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.086
I hope you guys have three.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.720
The power of such face-to-face contact

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.296
is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.136
among people who are socially engaged.
