00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.816
so for example, when you're
looking into the screen,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.736
you're not actually making eye contact.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.936
So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.216
can increase those neurotransmitters,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.816
or maybe changing
the position of the camera.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.536
So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.296
HW: Great. Thank you so much.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.536
SP: Thank you.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.710
