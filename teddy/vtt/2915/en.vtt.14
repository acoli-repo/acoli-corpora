00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.880
And of the people left standing,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880
what reduced their chances
of dying the most?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.056
That was her question.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.616
So let's now look at her data in summary,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.376
going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.616
OK?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.896
So clean air, which is great,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.960
it doesn't predict how long you will live.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.736
Whether you have your hypertension treated

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.096
is good.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.896
Still not a strong predictor.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.416
Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,
