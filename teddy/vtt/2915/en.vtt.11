00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.160
and here you see Zia Teresa.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.056
She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.736
which is called culurgiones,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.536
which are these large pasta pockets

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720
like ravioli about this size,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.656
this size,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.216
and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.016
and drenched in tomato sauce.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.280
And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.776
so they wouldn't open,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.816
and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.800
and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends.
