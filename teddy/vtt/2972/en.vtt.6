00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.096
To see if I could speak to someone,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
I shouted out that I was a friend,
that I would not hurt them.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.520
A woman in a red shirt
ran out of the forest.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.536
Others cautiously emerged from the trees

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.280
and asked, "Est-ce les gens savent?"

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.400
"Do people know?"

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.776
The question surprised me.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.256
Their children were hungry and sick,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.360
but they didn't ask for food or medicine.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.096
They asked me,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.280
"Do people know what is happening to us?"
