I felt helpless
as I wrote down their question.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.936
And I became determined

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.256
that this moment in their lives

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.480
should not be forgotten.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.816
In bearing witness to their crisis,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.200
I felt a small communion
with these people.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.360
From far away, this war had felt
like a footnote in world news.
