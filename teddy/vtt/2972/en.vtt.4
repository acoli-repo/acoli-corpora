to be killed.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.216
Cities and towns,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.960
any place with humans, had become unsafe.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.960
So people moved to the jungle.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.216
I felt strangely isolated

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.600
as pigs and livestock
moved into the empty homes.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.576
In a war zone,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.800
you know that you are near the killing
when people have left.
