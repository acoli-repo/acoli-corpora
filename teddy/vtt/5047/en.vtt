00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:09.201
After a savage seafaring skirmish

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.573
and eight long days of being 
battered by waves,

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:17.473
Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and 
sage as old as the world itself—

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:20.895
washed up on the shores 
of distant Pohjola.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:25.535
Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was 
a dark and frozen land,

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:30.023
ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth 
hag of the North."
