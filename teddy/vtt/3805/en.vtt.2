WEBVTT

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:03.639
decided that what if we took
this complex equipment that we have

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.038
for studying the brain and made it simple
enough and affordable enough

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.354
that anyone that you know, an amateur
or a high school student,

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:13.836
could learn and actually participate
in the discovery of neuroscience.

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:15.573
And so we did just that.

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:18.466
A few years ago, we started
a company called Backyard Brains

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.871
and we make DIY neuroscience equipment
and I brought some here tonight,

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.377
and I want to do some demonstrations.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:26.811
You guys want to see some?

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:29.774
So I need a volunteer.

00:01:29.774 --> 00:01:32.027
So right before -- what is your name?
