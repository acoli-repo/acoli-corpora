00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:01.451
on one motor action potential that's
happening right now inside of your brain.

00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.227
Do you guys want to see some more?

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.810
(Applause)

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.929
That's interesting,
but let's get it better.

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.278
I need one more volunteer.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.487
What is your name, sir?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.207
Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.400
GG: Miguel, all right.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.976
You're going to stand right here.

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.968
So when you're moving your arm like this,

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.083
your brain is sending a signal
down to your muscles right here.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.857
I want you to move your arm as well.

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:25.731
So your brain is going to send
a signal down to your muscles.

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:29.580
And so it turns out that there is
a nerve that's right here

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.336
that runs up here that innervates
these three fingers,
