00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:00.336
But some of your neurons
right here in your motor cortex

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.431
are going to send messages down
when you move your arm like this.

00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:05.915
They're going to go down
across your corpus callosum,

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.449
down onto your spinal cord
to your lower motor neuron

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.718
out to your muscles here,

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:12.327
and that electrical discharge
is going to be picked up

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:13.861
by these electrodes right here

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:15.583
and we're going to be able to listen

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.835
to exactly what your brain
is going to be doing.

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:19.835
So I'm going to turn this on for a second.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.131
Have you ever heard
what your brain sounds like?

00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:23.131
SK: No.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.900
GG: Let's try it out.
So go ahead and squeeze your hand.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.972
(Rumbling)

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:28.848
So what you're listening to,

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.111
so this is your motor units
happening right here.
