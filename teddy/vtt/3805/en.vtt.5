00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.111
so this is your motor units
happening right here.

00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.192
Let's take a look at it as well.

00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:36.961
So I'm going to stand over here,

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.152
and I'm going to open up our app here.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:41.727
So now I want you to squeeze.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:42.727
(Rumbling)

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.674
So right here, these are the motor units
that are happening

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:48.133
from her spinal cord
out to her muscle right here,

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:49.355
and as she's doing it,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:52.189
you're seeing the electrical activity
that's happening here.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.630
You can even click here
and try to see one of them.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.101
So keep doing it really hard.

00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.171
So now we've paused

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:01.451
on one motor action potential that's
happening right now inside of your brain.
