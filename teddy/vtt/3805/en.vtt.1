00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.247
and spend six and a half years
as a graduate student

00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:33.202
just to become a neuroscientist
to get access to these tools.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:35.539
And that's a shame
because one out of five of us,

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.365
that's 20 percent of the entire world,
will have a neurological disorder.

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:42.796
And there are zero cures
for these diseases.

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:45.015
And so it seems that
what we should be doing

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.432
is reaching back earlier
in the eduction process

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:52.009
and teaching students about neuroscience
so that in the future,

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.961
they may be thinking about possibly
becoming a brain scientist.

00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:59.758
When I was a graduate student,
my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:03.639
decided that what if we took
this complex equipment that we have
