00:01:29.774 --> 00:01:32.027
So right before -- what is your name?
(Applause)

00:01:32.027 --> 00:01:33.070
Sam Kelly: Sam.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.095
Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going
to record from your brain.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.849
Have you had this before?

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:38.950
SK: No.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.264
GG: I need you to stick out
your arm for science,

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:42.833
roll up your sleeve a bit,

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.713
So what I'm going to do,
I'm putting electrodes on your arm,

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:47.202
and you're probably wondering,

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:50.941
I just said I'm going to record from your
brain, what am I doing with your arm?

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:54.175
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons
inside your brain right now.

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:57.663
They're sending electrical messages
back and forth, and chemical messages.

00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:00.336
But some of your neurons
right here in your motor cortex
