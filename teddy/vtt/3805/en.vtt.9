00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:30.680
You know, when you lose your free will,
and someone else becomes your agent,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.306
it does feel a bit strange.

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.208
Now I want you to relax your hand.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.532
Sam, you're with me?

00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:36.997
So you're going to squeeze.

00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:40.284
I'm not going to turn it on yet,
so go ahead and give it a squeeze.

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:42.240
So now, are you ready, Miguel?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.062
MG: Ready as I'll ever be.

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:47.265
GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead
and turn your hand.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:49.298
Do you feel that a little bit?
MG: Nope.

00:04:49.298 --> 00:04:51.198
GG: Okay, do it again?
MG: A little bit.

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:52.884
GG: A little bit? (Laughter)

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:53.909
So relax.

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.325
So hit it again.

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.521
(Laughter)

00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:58.226
Oh, perfect, perfect.

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:00.110
So relax, do it again.
