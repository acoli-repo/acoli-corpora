The brain is an amazing and complex organ.

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:08.068
And while many people
are fascinated by the brain,

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:09.835
they can't really tell you that much

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:12.102
about the properties
about how the brain works

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:14.455
because we don't teach
neuroscience in schools.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:16.898
And one of the reasons
why is that the equipment

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:19.557
is so complex and so expensive

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:23.703
that it's really only done at major
universities and large institutions.

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.942
And so in order to be able
to access the brain,

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.767
you really need to dedicate your life

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.247
and spend six and a half years
as a graduate student
