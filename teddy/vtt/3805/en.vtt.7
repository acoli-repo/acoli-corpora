00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.336
that runs up here that innervates
these three fingers,

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:35.012
and it's close enough to the skin
that we might be able

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.346
to stimulate that so that what we can do

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:40.832
is copy your brain signals
going out to your hand

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.353
and inject it into your hand,

00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:45.726
so that your hand will move
when your brain tells your hand to move.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.933
So in a sense, she will take away
your free will

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:51.893
and you will no longer have
any control over this hand.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.567
You with me?

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.618
So I just need to hook you up.

00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:57.369
(Laughter)

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.430
So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.392
which is probably right around here.
