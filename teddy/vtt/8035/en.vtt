I hope you like memes,

00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:04.000
or the next few minutes
will get very awkward.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.376
(Laughter)

00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:07.754
Memes are our internet's lingua franca.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:11.841
So as a video game scholar,
but also a geek,

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:16.804
I will borrow them to talk about something
you might probably have heard about.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:18.848
The metaverse.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:20.725
Dam-dam-dam-dam.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:21.768
(Laughter)

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:24.187
I'm sorry, I don't have
the license for that sound.

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:27.023
I know, I know.

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:30.359
Sci-fi fans will be leaving
