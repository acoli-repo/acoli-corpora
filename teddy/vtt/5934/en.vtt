00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.230
I'm Kalika Bali,
I'm a linguist by training

00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:05.597
and a technologist by profession,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.297
I have worked in academia,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.597
in startups, in small companies
and multinationals for over two decades,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.363
doing research in and building
language technology systems.

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:21.030
My dream is to see technology work
across the language barrier.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.130
As a researcher
at Microsoft Research Labs India

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:29.697
I work in the field of language technology
and speech technology.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:33.297
And I worry about how
can we make technology accessible
