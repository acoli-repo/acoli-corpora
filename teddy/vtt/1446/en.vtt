00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is very strange for me, because Iâ€™m not used to doing this:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I usually stand on the other side of the light,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The previous speaker has, I think,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
really painted a very good background as to

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
