A few years ago,

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:05.444
I got one of those spam emails.

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.572
And it managed
to get through my spam filter.

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:10.152
I'm not quite sure how,
but it turned up in my inbox,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.325
and it was from a guy
called Solomon Odonkoh.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.564
(Laughter)

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.310
I know.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:16.564
(Laughter)

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:17.748
It went like this:

00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:19.390
it said, "Hello James Veitch,

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:22.953
I have an interesting business proposal
I want to share with you, Solomon."

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:27.159
Now, my hand was kind of hovering
on the delete button, right?

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:30.142
I was looking at my phone.
I thought, I could just delete this.
