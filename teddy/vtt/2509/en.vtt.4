(Applause)

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:05.324
He said, "What do you do for a living?"

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:07.203
(Laughter)

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.625
I said, "I'm a hedge fund
executive bank manager."

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.057
(Laughter)

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:17.953
This isn't the first time
I've shipped bullion, my friend,

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:19.638
no no no.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.140
Then I started to panic.

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:23.792
I was like, "Where are you based?"

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:24.998
I don't know about you,

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.390
but I think if we're going
via the postal service,

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.722
it ought to be signed for.

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:29.920
That's a lot of gold."
