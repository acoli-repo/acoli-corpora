I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?

KitKat."

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:34.732

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:36.628

Then I did get an email back from him.

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:44.278
He said, "The Business is on

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.280
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:52.066
What followed is the greatest email
I've ever received.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.272
(Laughter)

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:58.221
I'm not joking, this is what
turned up in my inbox.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.089
This was a good day.
