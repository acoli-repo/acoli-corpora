Crazy stuff happens when you start
replying to scam emails.

00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:04.125
It's really difficult,

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:05.727
and I highly recommend we do it.

00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.592
I don't think what I'm doing is mean.

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.368
There are a lot of people
who do mean things to scammers.

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:13.979
All I'm doing is wasting their time.

00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:17.053
And I think any time
they're spending with me

00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:19.674
is time they're not spending
scamming vulnerable adults

00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:21.071
out of their savings, right?

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:25.147
And if you're going to do this --
and I highly recommend you do --

00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:27.182
get yourself a pseudonymous email address.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:28.810
Don't use your own email address.

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:31.688
That's what I was doing at the start
and it was a nightmare.
