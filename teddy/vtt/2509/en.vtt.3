00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:30.211
I said, "Solomon, if we're
going to do it, let's go big.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:37.137
(Applause)

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:42.191
I can handle it.
How much gold do you have?"

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:45.302
(Laughter)

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.361
He said, "It is not a matter
of how much gold I have,

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.436
what matters is
your capability of handling.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.683
We can start with 50 kgs
as trial shipment."

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:54.578
I said, "50 kgs?

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:56.245
There's no point doing this at all

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.499
unless you're shipping
at least a metric ton."

00:01:58.523 --> 00:01:59.718
(Laughter)

00:01:59.742 --> 00:02:02.511
(Applause)
