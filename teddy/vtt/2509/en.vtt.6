00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.884
I don't know if we have
any statisticians in the house,

00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:04.917
but there's definitely something going on.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:06.575
(Laughter)

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.450
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email
you'll find a helpful chart.

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.574
I've had one of my assistants
run the numbers.

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:15.384
(Laughter)

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.789
We're ready for shipping
as much gold as possible."

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:21.305
There's always a moment where they try
to tug your heartstrings,

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.671
and this was it for Solomon.

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:25.322
He said, "I will be so much happy
if the deal goes well,

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:28.021
because I'm going to get
a very good commission as well."

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:31.339
And I said, "That's amazing,
What are you going to spend your cut on?"
