(Applause)

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:39.797
And that was so much fun, right,

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:41.171
that it got me thinking:

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:44.106
like, what would happen if I just spent
as much time as could

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.224
replying to as many
scam emails as I could?

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:51.121
And that's what I've been doing

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:53.245
for three years

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:54.550
on your behalf.

00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:56.969
(Laughter)

00:06:56.993 --> 00:06:59.312
