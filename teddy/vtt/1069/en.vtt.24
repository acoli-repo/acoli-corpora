00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
25,000 miles up,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
100-meter diameter lens.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
There were two groups of people who were interested in this:

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
planetary scientists, who want to look up,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and then other people, who wanted to look down.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Whether you look up or look down,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So you have to do something like this.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This was a small model.
