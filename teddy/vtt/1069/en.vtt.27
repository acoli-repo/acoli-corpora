00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and you can still see the fold lines.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The problem that's being solved here is

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
but needs to be small for the journey.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And that works whether you're going into space,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
or whether you're just going into a body.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And this example is the latter.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
at Oxford University.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
through your blood vessels.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,
