The guitar player from a single square,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the bass player from a single square.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that's not so hot.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Do a little more complicated instrument."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, then you could do an organ.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And what this has allowed is the creation

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
of origami-on-demand.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and you can go out and fold it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And sometimes you create high art,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But I want to show you some examples.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Everything you'll see here,
