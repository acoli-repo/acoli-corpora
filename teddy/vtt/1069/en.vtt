My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you'll see a little bit of a relation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It ties to origami. So let me start.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What is origami?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And that is what origami used to be.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But it's become something else.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The common theme -- what makes it origami --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is folding is how we create the form.
