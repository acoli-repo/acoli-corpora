00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And so they can do a simulation like this.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Those are the origami creases forming,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and now you can see the airbag inflate

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and find out, does it work?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And that leads

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
to a really interesting idea.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You know, where did these things come from?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Well, the heart stent

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
came from that little blow-up box

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that you might have learned in elementary school.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The airbag-flattening algorithm

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
came from all the developments

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
of circle packing and the mathematical theory
