00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
you can back off and just do a few things,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on a flag, with 13 stripes.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And if you want to go really crazy,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this guy's on display downstairs,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so take a look if you get a chance.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The most powerful tools in origami

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
have related to how we get parts of creatures.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I can put it in this simple equation.
