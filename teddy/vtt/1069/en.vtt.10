00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
into a few smaller steps.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So let me stretch out that equation.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I start with my idea. I abstract it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that has a part for every bit of the subject,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
a flap for every leg.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
you can turn it into the finished shape.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now the first step, pretty easy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --
