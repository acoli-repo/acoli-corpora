It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And you just draw a stick figure,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and it calculates the crease pattern.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you'll get this crease pattern.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
you'll get a base that you can then shape

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
into a deer,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And if you want a different deer,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,
