00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And if you look at how the layers stack,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a sheet can never

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
penetrate a fold.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All of origami comes from that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
give rise to that kind of complexity?"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
can be written down on a napkin,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and yet they govern all of chemistry,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all of life, all of history.
