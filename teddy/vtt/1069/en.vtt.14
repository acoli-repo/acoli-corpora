00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
origami artists discovered these principles

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
just by packing circles.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And here's where the dead people start to help us out,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
because lots of people have studied

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the problem of packing circles.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
looking at disc packings and arrangements.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.
