00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This, too, is origami,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Naturalism. Detail.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can get horns, antlers --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
even, if you look close, cloven hooves.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And it raises a question: what changed?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And what changed is something

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you might not have expected in an art,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is math.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That is, people applied mathematical principles

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to the art,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to discover the underlying laws.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that leads to a very powerful tool.
