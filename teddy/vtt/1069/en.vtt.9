00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
have related to how we get parts of creatures.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I can put it in this simple equation.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We take an idea,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And yeah, you really can.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
into a few smaller steps.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So let me stretch out that equation.
