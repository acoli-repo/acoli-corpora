all of life, all of history.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If we obey these laws,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we can do amazing things.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So in origami, to obey these laws,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we can take simple patterns --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and by itself it's nothing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But if we follow the laws of origami,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we can put these patterns into another fold

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that itself might be something very, very simple,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but when we put it together,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
we get something a little different.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This fish, 400 scales --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.
