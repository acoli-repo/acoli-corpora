00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to discover the underlying laws.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that leads to a very powerful tool.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The secret to productivity in so many fields --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and in origami --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is letting dead people do your work for you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
(Laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Because what you can do is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
take your problem,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and use their solutions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Origami revolves around crease patterns.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for an origami figure.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
