00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you change the packing,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and you can do an elk.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Or you could do a moose.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Or, really, any other kind of deer.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
These techniques revolutionized this art.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We found we could do insects,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
spiders, which are close,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
things with legs, things with legs and wings,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
things with legs and antennae.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
wasn't interesting enough,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
then you could do two praying mantises

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
from a single uncut square.
