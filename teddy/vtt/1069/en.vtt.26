00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
that scales to arbitrarily large size,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
but that allows any flat ring or disc

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And they adopted that for their first generation,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
But this is a five-meter telescope --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
has about a quarter-mile focal length.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it works perfectly on its test range,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Now, there is other origami in space.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and you can see here that the sail expands out,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and you can still see the fold lines.
