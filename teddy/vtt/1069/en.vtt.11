00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
going from the abstract description to the folded shape --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that's hard.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
can get us over the hump.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'm going to show you all how to do that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
so you can go out of here and fold something.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But we're going to start small.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This base has a lot of flaps in it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We're going to learn how to make one flap.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
How would you make a single flap?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
until it gets long and narrow,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
