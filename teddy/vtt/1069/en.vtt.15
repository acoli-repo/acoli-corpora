00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And it's so simple.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
(Laughter)

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It's so simple that a computer could do it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
in very basic terms, and with this, we could.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
