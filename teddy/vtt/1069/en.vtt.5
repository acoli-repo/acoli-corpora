00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for an origami figure.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They have to obey four simple laws.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And they're very simple, easy to understand.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
with just two colors without ever having

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the same color meeting.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The directions of the folds at any vertex --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
always differs by two. Two more or two less.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Nothing else.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If you look at the angles around the fold,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
you find that if you number the angles in a circle,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,
