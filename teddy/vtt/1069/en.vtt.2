00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and he created tens of thousands of new designs.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But even more importantly, he created a language,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a way we could communicate,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
a code of dots, dashes and arrows.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we now have a means of transmitting information

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with heredity and selection,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we know where that leads.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And where it has led in origami

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is to things like this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is an origami figure --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.
