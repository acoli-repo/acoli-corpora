00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
from a single uncut square.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
She's eating him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I call it "Snack Time."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And you can do more than just insects.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This -- you can put details,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This tree frog has toes.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Toes have become an origami meme,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
because everyone's doing it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You can make multiple subjects.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
The guitar player from a single square,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the bass player from a single square.
