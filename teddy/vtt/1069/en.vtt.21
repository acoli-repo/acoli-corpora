00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:33.000
(Video)

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Applause)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Computers made things move,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but these were all real, folded objects that we made.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And we can use this not just for visuals,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Surprisingly, origami

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and the structures that we've developed in origami

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
