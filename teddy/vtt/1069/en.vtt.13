00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
There's other ways of making flaps.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, no matter how I make a flap,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
it needs some part

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
of a circular region of paper.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So now we're ready to scale up.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And in the 1990s,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
origami artists discovered these principles
