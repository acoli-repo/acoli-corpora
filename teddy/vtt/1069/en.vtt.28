00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
through your blood vessels.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
based on a model called the water bomb base.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Airbag designers also have the problem

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
of getting flat sheets

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
into a small space.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And they want to do their design by simulation.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So they need to figure out how, in a computer,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to flatten an airbag.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the algorithms that we developed

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
to do insects

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
turned out to be the solution for airbags

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to do their simulation.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And so they can do a simulation like this.
