00:01:57.293 --> 00:02:00.476
begging to submit evidence
of Anna's son's special needs,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.778
but no one would even
talk to me about the case.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:06.240
It felt surreal to watch
the shoppers strolling idly by

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:08.860
what felt like a life-and-death situation.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.506
After several hours
of being stonewalled by CBP,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.918
I left.

00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:15.101
Several days later,

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.704

in the foster-care system.

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.760
But I didn't know what happened to Anna

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:21.133
until over a week later,

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.132
when she turned up
at a detention camp a few miles east.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.871
Now, Anna didn't have a criminal record,

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.672
and she followed the law
when asking for asylum.

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:33.353
Still, immigration officials
held her for three more months,
