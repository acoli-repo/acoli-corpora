00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:01.179
less than one percent of them
are able to find an attorney

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:03.203
to help them with their cases.

00:08:04.363 --> 00:08:08.923
The US government will point
to the lowest asylum approval rates

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.455
to argue that these people
are not really refugees,

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:15.185
when in fact, US asylum law
is an obstacle course

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:16.994
designed to make them fail.

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:19.967
Now not every migrant
at the border is a refugee.

00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:22.078
I meet plenty of economic migrants.

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:25.197
For example, people who want to go
to the United States to work,

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.007
to pay medical bills for a parent

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:29.674
or school fees for a child back home.

00:08:29.698 --> 00:08:32.709
Increasingly, I'm also meeting
climate refugees.
