And that largely helped
bring about an end to the official policy.

00:12:03.588 --> 00:12:06.461
But we know that the government
is still separating children.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.525
And things are actually getting worse.

00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:11.368
Today, the US government
is fighting for the right

00:12:11.392 --> 00:12:14.826
to detain refugee children
indefinitely in prison camps.

00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:16.958
This isn't over.

00:12:16.982 --> 00:12:20.196
We cannot allow ourselves
to become numb or look away.

00:12:21.077 --> 00:12:23.291
Those of us who are citizens of countries

00:12:23.315 --> 00:12:27.220
whose policies cause detention,
separation and death,

00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:29.869
need to very quickly decide
which side we're on.
