00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:30.220
but the situation is even worse
for refugee families today

00:07:30.244 --> 00:07:32.673
than it was during family separation.

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:35.189
Since January of 2019,

00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:36.991
the US has implemented a policy

00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:41.038
that's forced over 40,000 refugees
to wait in Mexico

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:44.000
for asylum hearings in the United States.

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:46.849
These refugees, many of whom are families,

00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:49.999
are trapped in some of the most
dangerous cities in the world,

00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:51.985
where they're being raped, kidnapped

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.180
and extorted by criminal groups.

00:07:54.204 --> 00:07:57.815
And if they survive for long enough
to make it to their asylum hearing,

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:01.179
less than one percent of them
are able to find an attorney
