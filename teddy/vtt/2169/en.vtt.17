00:08:29.698 --> 00:08:32.709
Increasingly, I'm also meeting
climate refugees.

00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:36.543
In particular, I'm meeting
a lot of indigenous Central Americans

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:39.313
who can no longer
sustain themselves by farming,

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:41.526
due to catastrophic drought in the region.

00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:43.799
We know that today,

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:46.561
people are migrating
because of climate change,

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.776
and that more will do so in the future,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.513
but we simply don't have a legal system
to deal with this type of migration.

00:08:53.522 --> 00:08:56.841
So, it would make sense, as a start,

00:08:56.865 --> 00:08:58.704
to expand the refugee definition

00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:01.585
to include climate refugees, for example.
