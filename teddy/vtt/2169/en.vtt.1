00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.466
at the San Ysidro port of entry,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.879
right next to a luxury outlet mall.

00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:34.975
It's also where, at any one time,

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:36.791
there's likely 800 immigrants

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.259
locked in freezing, filthy,
concrete cells below the building.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.291
Up top: shopping bags and frappuccinos.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:47.093
Downstairs: the reality
of the US immigration system.

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:50.212
And it's where, one day
in September of 2018,

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:52.465
I found myself trying to reach Anna,

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.347
a woman who CBP had recently separated
from her seven-year-old son.

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:58.412
I'm an immigration attorney

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.220
and the policy and litigation director
of Al Otro Lado,
