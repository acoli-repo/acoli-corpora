00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:33.523
because a foreign government
had placed a travel alert on my passport,

00:10:33.547 --> 00:10:36.229
designating me
as a national security risk.

00:10:36.253 --> 00:10:39.993
I was detained and interrogated
in a filthy room for hours.

00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:41.493
I begged the Mexican officials

00:10:41.517 --> 00:10:44.389
to let me go back to Mexico
and pick up my son,

00:10:44.413 --> 00:10:46.699
who was only 10 months old at the time.

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:48.675
But they refused,

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:51.141
and instead, they turned me over
to CBP officials,

00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:53.910
where I was forced back
into the United States.

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:57.406
It took me weeks to get another visa
so that I could go back to Mexico,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.065
and I went to the border, visa in hand.
