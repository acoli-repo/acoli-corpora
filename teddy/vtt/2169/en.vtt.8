00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:00.466
It seems like today,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.791
more people than ever are involved
in the fight for immigrant rights.

00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:07.101
But unfortunately, the situation
is just not getting better.

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.685
Thousands protested
to end family separations,

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.185
but the government
is still separating families.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.050
More than 900 children
have been taken from their parents

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:17.701
since June of 2018.

00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:22.034
Thousands more refugee children
have been taken from their grandparents,

00:04:22.058 --> 00:04:24.823
siblings and other
family members at the border.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.432
Since 2017,

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:30.022
at least two dozen people have died
in immigration custody.
