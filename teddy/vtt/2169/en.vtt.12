00:05:56.563 --> 00:06:00.103
Now, a lot of these people
would qualify as refugees

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:02.563
under the international legal definition.

00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.196
The Refugee Convention
was created after World War II

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.063
to give protection to people
fleeing persecution

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:13.527
based on their race, religion,
nationality, political opinion

00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.813
or membership
in a particular social group.

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:19.980
But even those who would be refugees
under the international definition

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.807
are not going to win asylum
in the United States.

00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:25.029
And that's because since 2017,

00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:29.109
the US Attorneys General have made
sweeping changes to asylum law,

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:33.101
to make sure that less people qualify
for protection in the United States.
