00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:30.727
are things I never thought
I would experience as a US citizen,

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.703
but I'm far from the only person
being criminalized for helping immigrants.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:38.489
The US and other countries
have made it a crime to save lives,

00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:41.442
and those of us who are simply
trying to do our jobs

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:44.914
are being forced to choose
between our humanity and our freedom.

00:11:45.498 --> 00:11:47.410
And the thing that makes me so desperate

00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:49.998
is that all of you
are facing the same choice,

00:11:50.022 --> 00:11:51.903
but you don't understand it yet.

00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:54.895
And I know there are
good people out there.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.831
I saw thousands of you in the streets,

00:11:56.855 --> 00:11:58.788
protesting family separation.

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:02.910
And that largely helped
bring about an end to the official policy.
