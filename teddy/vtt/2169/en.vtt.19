00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:30.641
first-world countries
have gone to deadly lengths

00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:33.260
to keep refugees from reaching our shores.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.985
But they've done more
than restrict the refugee definition.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.350
They've created parallel,
fascist-style legal systems

00:09:40.374 --> 00:09:44.469
in which migrants have none of the rights
that form the basis of a democracy,

00:09:44.493 --> 00:09:48.207
the alleged foundation of the countries
in which they're seeking refuge.

History shows us that the first group

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:54.538
to be vilified and stripped
of their rights is rarely the last,

00:09:54.562 --> 00:09:57.054
and many Americans and Europeans

00:09:57.078 --> 00:10:01.239
seem to accept an opaque
and unjust legal system for noncitizens,
