00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.799
Most disturbingly, there's Maria,

00:03:02.823 --> 00:03:07.108
a pregnant refugee who begged
for medical attention for eight hours

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:09.599
before she miscarried in CBP custody.

00:03:09.926 --> 00:03:12.982
CBP officials held her
for three more weeks

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.069
before they sent her back to Mexico,

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.030
where she is being forced to wait months

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.236
for an asylum hearing
in the United States.

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.656
Seeing these horrors
day in and day out has changed me.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.736
I used to be fun at parties,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.343
but now, I inevitably
find myself telling people

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.248
about how our government
tortures refugees at the border
