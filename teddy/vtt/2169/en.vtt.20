00:09:57.078 --> 00:10:01.239
seem to accept an opaque
and unjust legal system for noncitizens,

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:03.001
because they think they are immune.

00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:04.231

I learned this firsthand

00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:13.172

Mexican officials, although they had
given me a valid visa,

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:29.675
stopped me and told me
that I couldn't enter the country

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:33.523
because a foreign government
had placed a travel alert on my passport,
