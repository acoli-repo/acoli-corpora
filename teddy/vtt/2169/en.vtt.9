00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:30.022
at least two dozen people have died
in immigration custody.

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:32.878
And more will die, including children.

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.387
Now, we lawyers can
and will keep filing lawsuits

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.537
to stop the government
from brutalizing our clients,

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.265
but we can't keep tinkering
around the edges of the law

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.089
if we want migrants
to be treated humanely.

00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:50.720
This administration would have you believe
that we have to separate families

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:52.458
and we have to detain children,

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:55.553
because it will stop more refugees
from coming to our borders.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.220
But we know that this isn't true.

00:04:57.244 --> 00:04:59.149
In fact, in 2019,

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.577
the number of apprehensions
at our southern border
