00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.243
Now, not that this should matter,

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.791
but I knew that Anna's son
had special needs.

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:35.973
And once again,

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.744
this news filled me with the sense
of panic and foreboding

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:41.576
that has unfortunately become
a hallmark of my daily work.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.957
I had a signed authorization
to act as Anna's attorney,

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:46.989
so I rushed over to the port of entry

00:01:47.013 --> 00:01:48.901
to see if I could speak with my client.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.349
Not only would CBP officials
not let me speak to Anna,

00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:54.753
but they wouldn't even tell me
if she was there.

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:57.269
I went from supervisor to supervisor,

00:01:57.293 --> 00:02:00.476
begging to submit evidence
of Anna's son's special needs,
