WEBVTT

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:31.061
who have never been in a country
in which they feel safe.

00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:33.323
We meet women from all over the world

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:35.641
whose own governments
refuse to protect them

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:39.053
from brutal domestic violence
or repressive social norms.

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:41.667
Of course, we meet
Central American families

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:43.484
who are fleeing gang violence.

00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:45.524
But we also meet Russian dissidents,

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:47.032
Venezuelan activists,

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:51.016
Christians from China, Muslims from China,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.436
and thousands and thousands
of other refugees

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.006
fleeing all types
of persecution and torture.

00:05:56.563 --> 00:06:00.103
Now, a lot of these people
would qualify as refugees
