00:06:55.472 --> 00:07:00.321
Today, there are over 55,000 immigrants
detained in the United States,

00:07:00.345 --> 00:07:02.797
many in remote detention facilities,

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:04.551
far from any type of legal help.

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:06.577
And this is very important.

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:09.616
Because it's civil
and not criminal detention,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.918
there is no public defender system,

00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:14.831
so most detained immigrants
are not going to have an attorney

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:16.354
to help them with their cases.

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:18.823
An immigrant who has an attorney

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:21.863
is up to 10 times more likely
to win their case

00:07:21.887 --> 00:07:23.287
than one who doesn't.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.862
And as you've seen, I hate
to be the bearer of bad news,

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:30.220
but the situation is even worse
for refugee families today
