00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.577
the number of apprehensions
at our southern border

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.212
has actually gone up.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.347
And we tell people
every day at the border,

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.514
"If you seek asylum in the United States,

00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:09.212
you risk family separation,

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:11.560
and you risk being detained indefinitely."

00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:14.909
But for many of them,
the alternative is even worse.

00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:19.980
People seek refuge in the United States
for a lot of different reasons.

00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.941
In Tijuana, we've met refugees
from over 50 countries,

00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:24.949
speaking 14 different languages.

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:28.180
We meet LGBT migrants
from all over the world

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:31.061
who have never been in a country
in which they feel safe.
