held her for three more months,

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:35.250

Anna's story is not

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:44.037
There's Mateo, an 18-month-old boy,

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.125
who was ripped from his father's arms

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.831
and sent to a government shelter
thousands of miles away,

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.772

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:52.968
There's Amadou,

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:54.668
an unaccompanied African child,

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:59.759
who was held with adults for 28 days
in CBP's horrific facilities.
