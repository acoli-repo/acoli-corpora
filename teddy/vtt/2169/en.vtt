00:00:01.523 --> 00:00:02.960
Twice a week,

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.492
I drive from my home near Tijuana, Mexico,

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:08.674
over the US border,
to my office in San Diego.

00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:12.854
The stark contrast between the poverty
and desperation on one side of the border

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.737
and the conspicuous wealth on the other

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.449
always feels jarring.

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:19.203
But what makes this contrast
feel even starker

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.514
is when I pass by the building
that those of us who work on the border

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:24.855
unaffectionately refer to
as the black hole.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.316
The black hole is the Customs
and Border Protection,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.641
or CBP facility,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.466
at the San Ysidro port of entry,
