00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.220
and the policy and litigation director
of Al Otro Lado,

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:05.497
a binational nonprofit helping immigrants
on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.188
We'd met Anna several weeks earlier
at our Tijuana office,

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:13.196
where she explained that she feared
she and her son would be killed in Mexico.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.871
So we prepared her for the process
of turning herself over to CBP

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:18.220
to ask for asylum.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.341
A few days after she'd gone
to the port of entry to ask for help,

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:23.947
we received a frantic phone call

00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:26.365
from her family members
in the United States,

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.762
telling us that CBP officials
had taken Anna's son from her.
