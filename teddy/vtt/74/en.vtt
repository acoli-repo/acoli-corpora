00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:07.714
At no point did I think superheroes
would become such a huge part of my life.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.525
As a kid, I looked at them,
and I saw everything I wasn't.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.011
They had big muscles,

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:16.726
supermodel good looks,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.606
and phenomenal cosmic powers.

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:21.612
And me?

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.278
I kind of looked like this,

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:27.406
except shorter and with frizzier hair,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.088
and I never felt powerful.
