00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:01.345
Thank you.

00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:09.029
My friends, once again I fear
that we are allowing industry

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:12.483
to take advantage of the most
challenged among us

00:13:12.507 --> 00:13:14.224
in order to turn a profit,

00:13:14.248 --> 00:13:18.613
much like we saw with tobacco
and food in years past.

00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:21.004
So when we told the food industry

00:13:21.028 --> 00:13:24.526
that we understood the impact
our choices were having,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.660
and that we demanded better
for ourselves and our families,

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:30.645
that industry got into line.
