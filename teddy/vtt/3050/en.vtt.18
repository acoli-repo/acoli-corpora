At the same time,

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:07.161
schools with a minority population
of 75 to 100 percent

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:12.212
had 801 drug-related suspensions,

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:14.005
almost all of which were for THC.

00:09:15.303 --> 00:09:17.404
When discussing minority populations,

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:21.128
one that unfortunately often
gets left out of the conversation

00:09:21.152 --> 00:09:23.081
is the LGBTQ community.

00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:29.467
Members of this community are more
than twice as likely to consume THC

00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:32.895
than those who identify
as heterosexual or cisgender.
