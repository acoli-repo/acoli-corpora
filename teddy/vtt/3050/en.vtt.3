00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:33.035
I know that better than most,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.978
but I intend to do it anyway.

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:40.639
First, before I get started, let me
be perfectly clear about one thing:

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:44.678
my fight is not against the casual
adult use of marijuana --

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:46.508
I don't care about that.

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:49.862
What I care deeply about
is this new industry

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:53.201
that is working to convince us
that we are consuming something natural

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:55.513
while fixing social ills,

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:56.694
when we aren't.

00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.618
So let's start with
a little bit of Weed 101.
