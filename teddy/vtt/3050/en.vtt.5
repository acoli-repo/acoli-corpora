00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:30.484
That's CBD and THC.

00:02:30.944 --> 00:02:35.100
CBD is where almost all
of the medicinal properties lie.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.227
It's an incredibly fascinating
part of the plant

00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.978
with real potential to help people.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.708
It also is totally nonintoxicating.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:48.872
You could take a bath in the stuff
while vaping pure CBD

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.105
and drinking a CBD smoothie,

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.402
and you still couldn't get high.

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:54.576
(Laughter)

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.496
I've tried.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.535
(Laughter)

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:59.845
I haven't, I haven't.

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.446
That'd cost a lot of money.
