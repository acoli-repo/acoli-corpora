Cannabis is a plant that grows naturally
and has been used within textiles

00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.925
and even traditional Chinese medicine
for thousands of years.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.297
Genesis 1:12 even tells us:

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.544
"I have given you all of the seed-bearing
plants and herbs to use."

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:18.000
It's the microphone -- it's got
a TV preacher sort of thing.

00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:20.092
(Laughter)

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.151
Now, cannabis is made up of hundreds
of different chemicals,

00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:27.893
but two of those chemicals
are by far the most interesting.

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:30.484
That's CBD and THC.
