00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:32.704
and especially what's happening

00:14:32.728 --> 00:14:35.117
and some of the advances
that are being made

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:38.456
using parts of this plant and even
some whole-plant medicines,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.453
from the commercial market for THC.

00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:43.738
That's, I think, crucial.

00:14:43.762 --> 00:14:45.690
We've got to stop putting them together,

00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:48.656
and we've got to say, "OK, here's
the part about getting high,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.038
and here's the part about the medicine."

00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:53.645

JD: So it sounds like your talk
is less about being anti-cannabis
