00:12:30.662 --> 00:12:33.534
Even after all of my work
on the front lines

00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:36.815
and as a former consumer myself,

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.961
I was shocked and pissed
when I started to see

00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:42.500
what commercialization
was doing to cannabis,

00:12:42.524 --> 00:12:46.635
because, you see, our hope
for something pure and natural

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:49.665
is making it hard for us to see
what's really going on,

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:51.996
and that is that the rich
are getting richer

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.328
on the backs of the poor

00:12:53.352 --> 00:12:55.959
and lying to our faces the entire time.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:13:00.171
