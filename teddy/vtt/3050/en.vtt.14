00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:02.768
if we earn under 20,000 dollars a year

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:05.722
than those who earn
over 50,000 dollars a year.

00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:09.436
In other words, the poorer you are,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.476
the more likely you are to spend
your money on their products.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.579
And in this country, income
and race are highly correlated.

00:07:21.192 --> 00:07:24.697
One of the reasons we often hear cited
for the legalization of marijuana

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:28.461
is that it will help to stop
the disproportionate incarceration rates

00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:29.646
among minorities,

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.828
which is something everybody in this room
should be extremely concerned with.
