Legal marijuana coming into focus.

00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:39.823
Another big issue that we have
is in school suspension rates.

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:43.173
So, schools that are
predominantly white --

00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:47.303
that is, they have a minority population
of 25 percent or fewer --

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:51.416
in the first full year of data collection
following commercialization,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.575
these schools had a grand total
of 190 drug-related suspensions,

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:59.371
almost all of which are for THC.
