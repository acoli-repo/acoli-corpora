There's this whole new industry
using this language now.

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:06.250
You guys know.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.606
It's weed,

00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:10.029
an industry that taxed a sale

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:14.005
of about six billion dollars
worth of product in 2016.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:16.801
So what if I were to propose to you

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:21.098

Listen, I get it --

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.551
talking about issues with legal weed
is a pretty quick way to get uninvited

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:29.859
from the cool kids' table.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:33.035
I know that better than most,
