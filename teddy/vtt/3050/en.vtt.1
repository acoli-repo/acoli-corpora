to the way that the food we were eating

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:31.775
and with the earth,

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.767
the food industry had to listen.

00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:36.586
And the results have been really powerful.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.698
Now, those of you out there
from states like Washington and Oregon

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.055
and, of course, my fellow Coloradans --

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.768
(Cheers)

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.623
y'all know what I'm talking about.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.404
Because this is not ...

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:59.268
Words like "all-natural" and "homegrown"
are not just being used in our diets.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.179
There's this whole new industry
using this language now.
