My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about my project, Tidying Up Art.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First of all -- any questions so far?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because I'm speaking in a foreign language,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German
