You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
far from these beautiful mountains, where the people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is to measure their gross national happiness

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
rather than their gross national product.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And why not?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but a fundamental human right for all.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And what is happiness?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Happiness is the freedom of choice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The freedom to chose where to live,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what to do, what to buy, what to sell,
