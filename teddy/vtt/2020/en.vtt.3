00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.976
So, I was interested in these two rollers,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.381
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed
another mouse from a friend --

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:36.976
never returned to him --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.976
and I now had four rollers.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.976
Interestingly, what I did
with these rollers is,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.976
basically, I took them off of these mouses
and then put them in one line.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.976
It had some strings
and pulleys and some springs.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
What I got is basically
a gesture-interface device

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.976
that actually acts
as a motion-sensing device

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
made for two dollars.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
So, here, whatever movement
I do in my physical world
