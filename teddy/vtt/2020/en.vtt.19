Here, the camera is actually understanding
how you're holding the paper

00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:32.976
and playing a car-racing game.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Applause)

00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:40.174
Many of you already must have
thought, OK, you can browse.

00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:42.476
Yeah. Of course you can
browse to any websites

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.176
or you can do all sorts
of computing on a piece of paper

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.376
wherever you need it.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.976
So, more interestingly,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.976
I'm interested in how we can
take that in a more dynamic way.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.976
When I come back to my desk,
I can just pinch that information

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.976
back to my desktop

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.976
so I can use my full-size computer.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.976
(Applause)
