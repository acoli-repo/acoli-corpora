00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
So, here, whatever movement
I do in my physical world

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
is actually replicated
inside the digital world

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.096
just using this small device
that I made, around eight years back,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.976
in 2000.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.667
Because I was interested
in integrating these two worlds,

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:13.976
I thought of sticky notes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.976
I thought, "Why can I not connect

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.143
the normal interface
of a physical sticky note

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.976
to the digital world?"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.148
A message written
on a sticky note to my mom,

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:24.376
on paper,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.976
can come to an SMS,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
or maybe a meeting reminder

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.191
automatically syncs
with my digital calendar --
