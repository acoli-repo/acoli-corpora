00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.143
so that I don't need
to learn the new language

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.964
for interacting with those pixels?

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:36.976
So, in order to realize this dream,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.976
I actually thought of putting
a big-size projector on my head.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.239
I think that's why this is called
a head-mounted projector, isn't it?

00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:44.976
I took it very literally,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.976

put a little cut over there so that
the projector actually fits nicely.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:51.976
So now, what I can do --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.805
I can augment the world around me
with this digital information.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:57.876
But later,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.059
I realized that I actually
wanted to interact
