00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
why can I not use my computer

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
in the same way that I interact
in the physical world?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
So, I started this exploration
around eight years back,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
and it literally started
with a mouse on my desk.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.976
Rather than using it for my computer,
I actually opened it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.191
Most of you might be aware
that, in those days,

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.215
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.976
and there were two rollers

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.976
that actually guide the computer
where the ball is moving,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.096
and, accordingly,
where the mouse is moving.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.976
So, I was interested in these two rollers,
