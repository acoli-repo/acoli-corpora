00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.134
And I think this technology
will not only change the way --

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:04.134
(Laughter)

00:08:04.158 --> 00:08:05.176
Yes.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.678
It will change the way
we interact with people, also,

00:08:07.702 --> 00:08:09.217
not only the physical world.

00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:11.976
The fun part is, I'm going

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.976

of what you can think of

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.476
when this kind of technology
merges with real life.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.376
But many of you argue, actually,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.076
that all of our work is not
only about physical objects.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.076
We actually do lots
of accounting and paper editing
