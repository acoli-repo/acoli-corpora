We want to know about
dynamic things going around.

00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:05.976
So I thought, around last year --
in the beginning of the last year --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.477
I started thinking, "Why can I not take
this approach in the reverse way?"

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.176
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.976
and paint the physical world
with that digital information?"

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:21.776
Because pixels are actually, right now,
confined in these rectangular devices

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.547
that fit in our pockets.

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:25.976
Why can I not remove this confine

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
and take that to my everyday
objects, everyday life

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.143
so that I don't need
to learn the new language
