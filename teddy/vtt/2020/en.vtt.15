00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.465
(Video) And particularly I want
to thank two outstanding MIT --

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:33.523
Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing
the live [video] of his talk,

00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:35.489
outside, on just a newspaper.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.976
Your newspaper will show you
live weather information

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.606
rather than having it updated.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.477
You have to check your computer
in order to do that, right?

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:48.976
(Applause)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.976
When I'm going back,
I can just use my boarding pass

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.096
to check how much my flight
has been delayed,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.976
because at that particular time,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.976
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.976
and checking out a particular icon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.134
And I think this technology
will not only change the way --
