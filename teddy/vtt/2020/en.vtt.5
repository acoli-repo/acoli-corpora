00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.191
automatically syncs
with my digital calendar --

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.976
a to-do list that automatically
syncs with you.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
But you can also search
in the digital world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.976
or maybe you can write a query, saying,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.191
and this small system
actually prints it out --

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.692
so it actually acts like a paper
input-output system,

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:47.501
just made out of paper.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
In another exploration,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.976
I thought of making a pen
that can draw in three dimensions.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.976
So, I implemented this pen
that can help designers and architects

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.976
not only think in three dimensions,
