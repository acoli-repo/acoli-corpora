00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.976
the way we used to do it
maybe 20 years back,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.976
rather than now switching
between these two worlds.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.976
So, as a last thought,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.376
I think that integrating
information to everyday objects

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.976
will not only help us to get rid
of the digital divide,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.976
the gap between these two worlds,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.976
but will also help us, in some way,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.976
to stay human,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to be more connected
to our physical world.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.976
And it will actually help us
not end up being machines
