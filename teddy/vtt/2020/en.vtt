00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
We grew up

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.976
interacting with the physical
objects around us.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
There are an enormous number of them
that we use every day.

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:11.976
Unlike most of our computing devices,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.253
these objects are much more fun to use.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.976
When you talk about objects,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
one other thing automatically
comes attached to that thing,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
and that is gestures:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
how we manipulate these objects,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
how we use these objects in everyday life.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
We use gestures not only to interact
with these objects,
