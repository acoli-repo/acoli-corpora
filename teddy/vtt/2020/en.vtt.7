00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.976
Among all these experiments,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.976
there was one thing in common:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.505
I was trying to bring
a part of the physical world

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.027
to the digital world.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.976
I was taking some part of the objects,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.977
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.190
and bringing them to the digital world,

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:49.239
because the goal was to make
our computing interfaces more intuitive.

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:53.976
But then I realized that we humans
are not actually interested in computing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
What we are interested in is information.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
We want to know about things.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.381
We want to know about
dynamic things going around.
