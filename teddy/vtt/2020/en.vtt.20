(Applause)

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.976
And why only computers?
We can just play with papers.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.976
Paper world is interesting to play with.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.976
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.976
and putting over here a second part
from a second place,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.976
and I'm actually modifying the information
that I have over there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.976
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,
let me print it out, that thing."

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.381
So I now have a print-out of that thing.

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:28.729
So the workflow is more intuitive,

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.976
the way we used to do it
maybe 20 years back,
