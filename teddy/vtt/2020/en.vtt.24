CA: What are your own plans?
Are you staying at MIT,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.276
or are you going to do
something with this?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.829
PM: I'm trying to make this
more available to people

00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:07.529
so that anyone can develop
their own SixthSense device,

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:10.976
because the hardware is actually
not that hard to manufacture

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.976
or hard to make your own.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.572
We will provide all the open source
software for them,

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:16.976
maybe starting next month.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.976
CA: Open source? Wow.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.976
(Applause)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.429
CA: Are you going to come back to India
with some of this, at some point?

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:28.976
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.976
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?
