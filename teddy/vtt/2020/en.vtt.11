00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.976
Whatever you're doing with your hands,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.976
it's understanding that gesture.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.576
And, actually, if you see,
there are some color markers

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.076
that in the beginning version
we are using with it.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.976
You can start painting on any wall.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.976
You stop by a wall,
and start painting on that wall.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.143
But we are not only tracking
one finger, here.

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:48.976
We are giving you the freedom
of using all of both of your hands,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.143
so you can actually use both of your hands
to zoom into or zoom out

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:54.143
of a map just by pinching all present.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.976
The camera is actually doing --
just, getting all the images --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.976
is doing the edge recognition
and also the color recognition
