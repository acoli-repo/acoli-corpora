00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.076
We actually do lots
of accounting and paper editing

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.391
and all those kinds of things;
what about that?

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:37.976
And many of you are excited
about the next-generation tablet computers

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.976
to come out in the market.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.976
So, rather than waiting for that,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.976
I actually made my own,
just using a piece of paper.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So, what I did here
is remove the camera --

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:50.976
All the webcam cameras have
a microphone inside the camera.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.976
I removed the microphone from that,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
and then just pinched that --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
like I just made a clip
out of the microphone --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.976
and clipped that to a piece of paper,
any paper that you found around.
