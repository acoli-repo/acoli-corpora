We use gestures not only to interact
with these objects,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.286
but we also use them
to interact with each other.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.976
A gesture of "Namaste!",
maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.429
in India I don't need to teach
a kid that this means

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:40.976
"four runs" in cricket.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.523
It comes as a part
of our everyday learning.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:47.976
So, I am very interested,
from the beginning,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
how our knowledge
about everyday objects and gestures,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
and how we use these objects,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.976
can be leveraged to our interactions
with the digital world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.976
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
why can I not use my computer
