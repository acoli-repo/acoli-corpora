WEBVTT

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.976
is doing the edge recognition
and also the color recognition

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.976
and so many other small algorithms
are going on inside.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, technically,
it's a little bit complex,

00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:09.500
but it gives you an output which is more
intuitive to use, in some sense.

00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:12.376
But I'm more excited that you can
actually take it outside.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.976
Rather than getting your camera
out of your pocket,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.976
you can just do the gesture
of taking a photo,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.976
and it takes a photo for you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.976
(Applause)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Thank you.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.976
And later I can find a wall, anywhere,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.976
and start browsing those photos

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.676
or maybe, "OK, I want to modify
this photo a little bit
