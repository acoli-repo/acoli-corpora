not only think in three dimensions,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.976
but they can actually draw,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.048
so that it's more intuitive
to use that way.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:07.120
Then I thought,
"Why not make a Google Map,

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:08.976
but in the physical world?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.976
Rather than typing a keyword
to find something,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.976
I put my objects on top of it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.191
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me
where the flight gate is.

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:19.976
A coffee cup will show
where you can find more coffee,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.976
or where you can trash the cup.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.976
So, these were some
of the earlier explorations I did

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because the goal was to connect
these two worlds seamlessly.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.976
Among all these experiments,
