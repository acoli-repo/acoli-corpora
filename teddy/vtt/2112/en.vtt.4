00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:03.466
I could go to Germany to study.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:07.371
So now, I suppose,

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.045
I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:16.502
it is for me to be standing before you today.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:20.874
From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.180
to Berlin in Germany to become an architect

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.345
is a big, big step.
