00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:30.009
we hurry up to protect our fragile walls

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.061
against the rain.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:36.573
Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:39.138
It is simply how we protect our walls.

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:40.607
(Laughter)

00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:43.485
The rain in Burkina comes very fast,

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:46.050
and after that, you have floods

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.995
everywhere in the country.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.045
But for us, the rain is good.

00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:55.950
It brings sand and gravel to the river

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.221
we need to use to build.

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:00.122
We just wait for the rain to go.
