00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.485
I am an example of that.

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:36.393
I was born in a little village called Gando.

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:40.885
In Gando, there was no electricity,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:45.099
no access to clean drinking water, and no school.

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.923
But my father wanted me

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.972
to learn how to read and write.

00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:54.020
For this reason, I had to leave my family

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.914
when I was seven and to stay in a city

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.902
far away from my village

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:03.579
with no contact with my family.
