00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:34.211
There is still no electricity in my village.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.673
People still are dying in Burkina Faso,

00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:40.276
and access to clean drinking water

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:44.499
is still a big problem.

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:52.051
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.803
when you grow up in a place like that.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:57.172
But I was lucky.

00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:59.256
I had a scholarship.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:03.466
I could go to Germany to study.
