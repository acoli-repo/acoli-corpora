00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:03.646
I would like to show you how

00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.523
architecture has helped

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.618
to change the life of my community

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:14.433
and has opened opportunities to hope.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.392
I am a native of Burkina Faso.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.610
According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.659
is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.506
but what does it look like

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:29.925
to grow up in a place like that?

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.485
I am an example of that.
