00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.967
to the building site.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.133
we start cutting them,

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.064
and then we place them on top of the roof

00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:39.643
before we pour the concrete,

00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:41.654
and you have this result.

00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:44.564
The openings are letting the hot air out

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.403
and light in.

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:48.476
Very simple.

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:51.314
My most recent project in Gando

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:53.332
is a high school project.

00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:55.265
I would like to share with you this.

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:57.510
The innovation in this project

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.253
is to cast mud like you cast concrete.
