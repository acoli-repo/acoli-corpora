00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.576
because we are the first
generation to see this

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.360
and probably the last with a real chance
of turning this story around.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.056
You see, 20th century economics assured us
that if growth creates inequality,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.576
don't try to redistribute,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.816
because more growth
will even things up again.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.656
If growth creates pollution,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.200
don't try to regulate, because more growth
will clean things up again.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.176
Except, it turns out, it doesn't,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.656
and it won't.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.856
We need to create economies that tackle
this shortfall and overshoot together,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.416
by design.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.016
We need economies that are regenerative
and distributive by design.
