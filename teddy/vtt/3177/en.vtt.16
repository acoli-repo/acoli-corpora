00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.736
So this double-sided challenge
to meet the needs of all

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.256
within the means of the planet,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.536
it invites a new shape of progress,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.536
no longer this ever-rising line of growth,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.496
but a sweet spot for humanity,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.056
thriving in dynamic balance
between the foundation and the ceiling.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.696
And I was really struck
once I'd drawn this picture

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.016
to realize that the symbol of well-being
in many ancient cultures

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.616
reflects this very same sense
of dynamic balance,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.536
