00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.016
We need economies that are regenerative
and distributive by design.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.736
You see, we've inherited
degenerative industries.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.856
We take earth's materials,
make them into stuff we want,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.496
use it for a while, often only once,
and then throw it away,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.216
and that is pushing us
over planetary boundaries,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.736
so we need to bend those arrows around,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.976
create economies that work with and within
the cycles of the living world,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.056
so that resources are never used up
but used again and again,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.056
economies that run on sunlight,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.616
where waste from one process
is food for the next.
