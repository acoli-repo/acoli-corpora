I know, I'm sorry,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.696
but let me introduce you
to the one doughnut

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.056
that might actually turn out
to be good for us.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.296
So imagine humanity's resource use
radiating out from the middle.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.976
That hole in the middle is a place

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.456
where people are falling short
on life's essentials.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.616
They don't have the food, health care,
education, political voice, housing

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.456
that every person needs
for a life of dignity and opportunity.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.696
We want to get everybody out of the hole,
over the social foundation

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.720
and into that green doughnut itself.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.200
But, and it's a big but,
