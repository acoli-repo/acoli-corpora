00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.200
But, and it's a big but,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.056
we cannot let our collective resource use
overshoot that outer circle,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.496
the ecological ceiling,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.336
because there we put so much pressure
on this extraordinary planet

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.536
that we begin to kick it out of kilter.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.536
We cause climate breakdown,
we acidify the oceans,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.616
a hole in the ozone layer,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.816
pushing ourselves
beyond the planetary boundaries

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.496
of the life-supporting systems
that have for the last 11,000 years

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.640
made earth such a benevolent
home to humanity.
