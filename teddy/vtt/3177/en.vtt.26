Yes, we need to dematerialize
our economies,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.416
but this dependency on unending growth
cannot be decoupled from resource use

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.816
on anything like the scale required

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.600
to bring us safely back
within planetary boundaries.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.816
I know this way of thinking
about growth is unfamiliar,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.896
because growth is good, no?

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.856
We want our children to grow,
our gardens to grow.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.136
Yes, look to nature and growth
is a wonderful, healthy source of life.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.376
It's a phase, but many economies
like Ethiopia and Nepal today

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.776
may be in that phase.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.240
Their economies are growing
at seven percent a year.
