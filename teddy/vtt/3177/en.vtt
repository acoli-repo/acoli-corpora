Have you ever watched
a baby learning to crawl?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.176
Because as any
parent knows, it's gripping.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.096

but then they drag themselves forwards,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.296
and then they pull themselves up to stand,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.176
and we all clap.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.176
And that simple motion
of forwards and upwards,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.600
it's the most basic direction
of progress we humans recognize.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.816
We tell it in our story
of evolution as well,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.856
from our lolloping ancestors
to Homo erectus, finally upright,
