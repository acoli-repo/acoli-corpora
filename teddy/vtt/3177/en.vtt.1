00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.856
from our lolloping ancestors
to Homo erectus, finally upright,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.336
to Homo sapiens, depicted, always a man,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.760
always mid-stride.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.136
So no wonder we so readily believe

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.896
that economic progress
will take this very same shape,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.560
this ever-rising line of growth.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.696
It's time to think again,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.280
to reimagine the shape of progress,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.736
because today, we have economies

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.320
that need to grow,
whether or not they make us thrive,
