00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.096
putting publicly traded companies
under constant pressure

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.456
to deliver growing sales,
growing market share and growing profits,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.976
and because banks create money
as debt bearing interest,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.480
which must be repaid with more.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.936
We're politically addicted to growth

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.096
because politicians
want to raise tax revenue

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.536
without raising taxes

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.656
and a growing GDP
seems a sure way to do that.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.256
And no politician wants to lose
their place in the G-20 family photo.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.496
(Laughter)

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.216
But if their economy stops growing
while the rest keep going,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.576
well, they'll be booted out
by the next emerging powerhouse.
