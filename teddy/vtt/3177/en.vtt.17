00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.320
So can we find this dynamic balance
in the 21st century?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.176
Well, that's a key question,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.856

falling short and overshooting
at the same time.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.656

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.320
still fall short
on their most basic of needs.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.616
And yet, we've already overshot at least
four of these planetary boundaries,
