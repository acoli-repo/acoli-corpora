00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.456
because humanity's
21st century challenge is clear:

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.256
to meet the needs of all people

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.776
within the means of this
extraordinary, unique, living planet

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.320
so that we and the rest
of nature can thrive.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.656
Progress on this goal isn't going
to be measured with the metric of money.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.016
We need a dashboard of indicators.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.456
And when I sat down to try and draw
a picture of what that might look like,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.776
strange though this is going to sound,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.120
it came out looking like a doughnut.
