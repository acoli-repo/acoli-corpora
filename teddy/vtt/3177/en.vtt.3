Well, GDP, gross domestic product,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.336
it's just the total cost
of goods and services

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.496
sold in an economy in a year.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.056
It was invented in the 1930s,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.056
but it very soon became
the overriding goal of policymaking,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.816
so much so that even today,
in the richest of countries,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.776
governments think that the solution
to their economic problems

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.360
lies in more growth.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.576
Just how that happened

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.696
is best told through
the 1960 classic by W.W. Rostow.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.120
I love it so much,
I have a first-edition copy.
