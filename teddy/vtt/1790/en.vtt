00:00:01.204 --> 00:00:04.305
Good afternoon, I'm proud
to be here at TEDxKrakow.

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:07.326
I'll try to speak a little bit today
about a phenomenon

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.352
which can, and actually is
changing the world,

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.368
and whose name is people power.

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:13.900
I'll start with an anecdote,

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:17.047
or for those of you
who are Monty Python lovers,

00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:18.518
a Monty Python type of sketch.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:19.573
Here it is.

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:22.732
It is December 15, 2010.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.238
Somebody gives you a bet:
you will look at a crystal ball,

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:28.929
and you will see the future;
the future will be accurate.

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:30.873
But you need to share it with the world.
