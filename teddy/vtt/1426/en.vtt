00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.256
I've always wanted to be a cyborg.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.456
One of my favorite shows as a kid
was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.656
and this is a little bit closer
to the 240-dollar man or so, but --

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.976
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.416
At any rate, I would normally
feel very self-conscious and geeky

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.656
wearing this around,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.016
but a few days ago
I saw one world-renowned statistician

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.616
swallowing swords on stage here,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.600
so I figure it's OK amongst this group.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.496
But that's not what I want
to talk about today.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.416
I want to talk about toys,
and the power that I see inherent in them.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.616
When I was a kid,
I attended Montessori school
