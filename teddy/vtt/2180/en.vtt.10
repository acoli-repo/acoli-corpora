00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.050
And I got really excited,

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:05.656
because I started thinking maybe
machines don't need to be just tools,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.100
but they can function
as nonhuman collaborators.

00:05:09.537 --> 00:05:11.084
And even more than that,

00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:13.537
I thought maybe
the future of human creativity

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:15.085
isn't in what it makes

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:18.545
but how it comes together
to explore new ways of making.

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.291
So if D.O.U.G._1 was the muscle,

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:23.077
and D.O.U.G._2 was the brain,

00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:26.029
then I like to think
of D.O.U.G._3 as the family.

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:31.275
I knew I wanted to explore this idea
of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale.
