How does our desire for perfection,
precision and automation

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.172
affect our ability to be creative?

00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:38.640
In my work as an artist and researcher,
I explore AI and robotics

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.669
to develop new processes
for human creativity.

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:43.363
For the past few years,

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:47.763

data and emerging technologies.

00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:50.004
It's part of a lifelong fascination

00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:52.763
about the dynamics
of individuals and systems

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.168
and all the messiness that that entails.

00:00:55.192 --> 00:01:00.000
It's how I'm exploring questions about
where AI ends and we begin
