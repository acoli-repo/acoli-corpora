00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:31.763
direction, dwell and velocity states
of urban movement.

00:06:32.178 --> 00:06:36.447
Our system extracted those states
from the feeds as positional data

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:39.844
and became pads for my
robotic units to draw on.

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:42.402
Instead of a collaboration of one-to-one,

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:45.450
we made a collaboration of many-to-many.

00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:49.061
By combining the vision of human
and machine in the city,

00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:51.879
we reimagined what
a landscape painting could be.

00:06:51.903 --> 00:06:54.121
Throughout all of my
experiments with D.O.U.G.,

00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:56.862
no two performances
have ever been the same.

00:06:56.886 --> 00:06:58.268
And through collaboration,

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.156
we create something that neither of us
could have done alone:
