00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:33.656
We're inviting anyone who's interested
in the future of work, systems

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.275
and interhuman collaboration

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:36.849
to explore with us.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.278
We know it's not just technologists
that have to do this work

00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:42.405
and that we all have a role to play.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.672
We believe that by teaching machines

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.426
how to do the work
traditionally done by humans,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.403
we can explore and evolve our criteria

00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:52.870
of what's made possible by the human hand.

00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:56.387
And part of that journey
is embracing the imperfections

00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:00.101
and recognizing the fallibility
of both human and machine,
