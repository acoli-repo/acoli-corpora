00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:30.334
And I realized it's not just made
of models and classifiers

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:31.680
for the neural network.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:35.236
But it's a fundamentally
malleable and shapable system,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.371
one in which the human hand
is always present.

00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:42.395
It's far from the omnipotent AI
we've been told to believe in.

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.934
So I collected these drawings
for the neural net.

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.887
And we realized something
that wasn't previously possible.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:53.002
My robot D.O.U.G. became
a real-time interactive reflection

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:55.653
of the work I'd done
through the course of my life.

00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:59.542
The data was personal,
but the results were powerful.

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.050
And I got really excited,
