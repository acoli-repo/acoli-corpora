00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:31.275
I knew I wanted to explore this idea
of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale.

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.672
So over the past few months,

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.831
I worked with my team
to develop 20 custom robots

00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:37.815
that could work with me as a collective.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.132
They would work as a group,

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:42.045
and together, we would collaborate
with all of New York City.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.013
I was really inspired
by Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li,

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:47.552
who said, "if we want to teach
machines how to think,

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:49.560
we need to first teach them how to see."

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:52.369
It made me think of the past decade
of my life in New York,

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:56.386
and how I'd been all watched over by these
surveillance cameras around the city.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.466
And I thought it would be
really interesting

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.895
if I could use them
to teach my robots to see.
