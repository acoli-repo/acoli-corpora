00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.291
can help us think a little bit more deeply

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:35.212
about what is human
and what is the machine.

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:37.649
And it's led me to the realization

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:40.728
that collaboration is the key
to creating the space for both

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:42.019
as we move forward.

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:45.133
It all started with a simple
experiment with machines,

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:47.983
called "Drawing Operations
Unit: Generation 1."

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:50.950
I call the machine "D.O.U.G." for short.

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:52.300
Before I built D.O.U.G,

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:54.689
I didn't know anything
about building robots.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.117
I took some open-source
robotic arm designs,

00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:01.482
I hacked together a system
where the robot would match my gestures
