00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.053
But something interesting happened,
something I didn't anticipate.

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:37.879
See, D.O.U.G., in its primitive form,
wasn't tracking my line perfectly.

00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:40.236
While in the simulation
that happened onscreen

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.617
it was pixel-perfect,

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.172
in physical reality,
it was a different story.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:47.013
It would slip and slide
and punctuate and falter,

00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:49.105
and I would be forced to respond.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:51.303
There was nothing pristine about it.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:54.565
And yet, somehow, the mistakes
made the work more interesting.

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.343
The machine was interpreting
my line but not perfectly.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:58.739
And I was forced to respond.

00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:01.472
We were adapting
to each other in real time.
