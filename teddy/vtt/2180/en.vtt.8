00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.321
I painstakingly collected
as many of my drawings as I could find --

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:04.560
finished works, unfinished experiments
and random sketches --

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:06.583
and tagged them for the AI system.

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:10.291
And since I'm an artist,
I've been making work for over 20 years.

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.339
Collecting that many drawings took months,

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:13.752
it was a whole thing.

00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:16.371
And here's the thing
about training AI systems:

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.595
it's actually a lot of hard work.

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:21.213
A lot of work goes on behind the scenes.

00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:23.918
But in doing the work,
I realized a little bit more

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:27.363
about how the architecture
of an AI is constructed.

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:30.334
And I realized it's not just made
of models and classifiers
