00:00:55.192 --> 00:01:00.000
It's how I'm exploring questions about
where AI ends and we begin

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:01.666
and where I'm developing processes

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.016
that investigate potential
sensory mixes of the future.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:08.532
I think it's where philosophy
and technology intersect.

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.231
Doing this work
has taught me a few things.

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.466
It's taught me how embracing imperfection

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.979
can actually teach us
something about ourselves.

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:19.764
It's taught me that exploring art

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:22.719
can actually help shape
the technology that shapes us.

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:26.409
And it's taught me
that combining AI and robotics

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.965
with traditional forms of creativity --
visual arts in my case --

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.291
can help us think a little bit more deeply
