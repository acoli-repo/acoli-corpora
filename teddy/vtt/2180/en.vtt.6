00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:01.472
We were adapting
to each other in real time.

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:03.433
And seeing this taught me a few things.

00:03:03.457 --> 00:03:08.337
It showed me that our mistakes
actually made the work more interesting.

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:12.912
And I realized that, you know,
through the imperfection of the machine,

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:16.641
our imperfections became
what was beautiful about the interaction.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.737
And I was excited,
because it led me to the realization

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:24.411
that maybe part of the beauty
of human and machine systems

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:27.173
is their shared inherent fallibility.

00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:29.017
For the second generation of D.O.U.G.,

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.348
I knew I wanted to explore this idea.
