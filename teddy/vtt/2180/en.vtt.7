I knew I wanted to explore this idea.

00:03:31.372 --> 00:03:35.790
But instead of an accident produced
by pushing a robotic arm to its limits,

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.711
I wanted to design a system
that would respond to my drawings

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:40.568
in ways that I didn't expect.

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:44.441
So, I used a visual algorithm
to extract visual information

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:47.443
from decades of my digital
and analog drawings.

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.522
I trained a neural net on these drawings

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:52.411
in order to generate
recurring patterns in the work

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:55.911
that were then fed through custom software
back into the machine.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.321
I painstakingly collected
as many of my drawings as I could find --
