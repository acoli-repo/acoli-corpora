00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:01.482
I hacked together a system
where the robot would match my gestures

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.145
and follow [them] in real time.

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:04.617
The premise was simple:

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.841
I would lead, and it would follow.

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:10.339
I would draw a line,
and it would mimic my line.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:14.061
So back in 2015, there we were,
drawing for the first time,

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:16.704
in front of a small audience
in New York City.

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.283
The process was pretty sparse --

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:22.794
no lights, no sounds,
nothing to hide behind.

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.636
Just my palms sweating
and the robot's new servos heating up.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.391
(Laughs) Clearly, we were
not built for this.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.053
But something interesting happened,
something I didn't anticipate.
