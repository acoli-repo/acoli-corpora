Sleep is perhaps the
single most effective thing

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.073
that we can do each and every day

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:08.816
to reset the health
of our brain and our body.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.756
And by understanding a little bit more
about what sleep is,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.238
perhaps we can get the chance to improve
both the quantity and the quality

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:18.269
of our sleep.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.914
Well, sleep, at least in human beings,

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:31.926
is subdivided into two main types.
