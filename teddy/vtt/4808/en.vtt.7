00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.151
While optical storage media are cheap
and removable,

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.878
they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:37.236
and lower capacity as well.

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:42.871
Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.025
like flash sticks.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.957
These have no moving parts,

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:48.627
instead using floating gate transistors

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:53.134
that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:56.453
within their specially designed 
internal structures.

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.739
So how reliable 
are these billions of bits?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.463
We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent,
