00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.560
data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.203
But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.621
in order to be read,

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:14.510
the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.626
On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:20.621
also uses spinning discs,

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.813
but with a reflective coating.

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:28.029
Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser.

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.151
While optical storage media are cheap
and removable,
