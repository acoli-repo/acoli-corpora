00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:31.722
That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:33.624
which don't need refreshing.

00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:36.779
SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system,

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.680
but also the most expensive,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.414
and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM.

00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:46.597
But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:49.625
For data to remain
once the device is turned off,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.005
it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device,

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.291
which comes in three major types.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.739
In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.560
data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.
