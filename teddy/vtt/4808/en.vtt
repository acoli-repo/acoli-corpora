In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.059
helping us remember our past,

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.989
learn and retain skills,

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.273
and plan for the future.

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:19.916
And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.126
memory plays much the same role,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.711
whether it's a two-hour movie,

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:25.283
a two-word text file,

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:27.833
or the instructions for opening either,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.372
everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits,
