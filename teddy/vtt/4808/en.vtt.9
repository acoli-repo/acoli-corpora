00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:31.958
having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy,

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:36.333
scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.649
down to the quantum level

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:40.998
in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster,

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:42.063
smaller,

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.609
and more durable.

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:49.045
For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.
