00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.463
We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent,

00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:06.363
but it actually degrades fairly quickly.

00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:09.000
The heat generated from a device
and its environment

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.739
will eventually demagnetize hard drives,

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.991
degrade the dye in optical media,

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.115
and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates.

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:20.081
Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness.

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.095
Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them,

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.705
eventually rendering them useless.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.215
With data on most current storage media

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:31.958
having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy,
