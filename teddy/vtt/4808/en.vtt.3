It could also modify them,
or create new ones.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:38.258
The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency.

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:43.801
And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously,

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.563
all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order,

00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:51.714
hence the name random access memory.

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:55.900
The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.989
There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor
