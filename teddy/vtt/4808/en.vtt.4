00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.989
There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.987
that store electrical charges,

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:07.555
a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.167
Such memory is called dynamic

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:13.380
because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.759
requiring periodic recharging
to retain data.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.006
But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.651
is too long for modern CPUs,

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.563
so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.513
made from static RAM.

00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:31.722
That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors
