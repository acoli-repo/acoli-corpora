00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:01.532
computer designers face 
a constant struggle

00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:05.295
between size, cost, and speed.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:10.126
Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks,

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.407
and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.277
When you run a program,

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.950
your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.845
for performing those instructions.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:24.392
For example, when you press a key
in a word processor,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:29.536
the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:33.861
It could also modify them,
or create new ones.
