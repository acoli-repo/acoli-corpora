00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.372
everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:35.846
or binary digits.

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:38.387
Each of these is stored in a memory cell

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.185
that can switch between two states
for two possible values,

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.057
0 and 1.

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:47.177
Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits,

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:50.428
all processed in 
the central processing unit,

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:51.746
or CPU,

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:54.096
that acts as the computer's brain.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:58.671
And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially,

00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:01.532
computer designers face 
a constant struggle
