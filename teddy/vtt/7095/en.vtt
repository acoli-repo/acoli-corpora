In 1968, Dr. Robert Ho Man Kwok felt ill
after dinner at a Chinese restaurant.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.890
He wrote a letter detailing his symptoms
to a prestigious medical journal,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.478
pondering whether his illness had resulted
from eating monosodium glutamate—

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:25.146
also known as MSG.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.192
Kwok’s connection between his headache 
and this common seasoning

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:32.570
in American Chinese cuisine 
was just a hunch.
