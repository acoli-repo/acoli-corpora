More than 2,500 years ago,

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:14.371
one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated 
popstars and erotic poets

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.121
enraptured listeners.

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:21.663
In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard
his nephew singing one of their songs

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:25.871
and enjoyed it so much that he asked 
the boy to teach it to him—

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:28.788
“So that I may learn it and die,” he said.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.663
So, who was this revered figure?
