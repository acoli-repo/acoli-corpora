00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But I'm also going to argue

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you realize that just affirming compassion,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There's a lot of work to be done after that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In the beginning, there was compassion,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but actually even before that.
