00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a second kind of evolutionary logic.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Biologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And there, the basic idea is that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
as you may have heard in the past,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is ultimately self-serving too.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
