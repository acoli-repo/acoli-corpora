So, it's another good news/bad news story.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
by this kind of evolutionary logic.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So, there's still work to be done.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which I think is kind of good news,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which is that the way that this is played out in the human species,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,
