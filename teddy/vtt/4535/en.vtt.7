00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is ultimately self-serving too.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
you feel really bad.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But if you read in the newspaper

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you can probably live with that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
That's just human nature.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So, it's another good news/bad news story.
