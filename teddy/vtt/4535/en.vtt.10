00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it's good to treat other people well.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we still aren't to universal love,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.
