00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
where there's a winner and a loser.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, their fortunes add up to zero.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
or good for them, bad for you.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, if you're playing doubles,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
then the person on your side of the net

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's a non-zero-sum game.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
