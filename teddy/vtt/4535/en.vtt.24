00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
with Muslims halfway around the world,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to threaten American security.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.
