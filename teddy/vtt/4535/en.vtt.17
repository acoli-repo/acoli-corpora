That's a non-zero-sum game.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You both feel you've won.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,
