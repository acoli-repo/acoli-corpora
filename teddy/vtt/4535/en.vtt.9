I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but you can go to a hunter gatherer society

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
no exposure to ethical philosophy,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and you'll find, if you spend time with these people,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and that bad deeds should be punished.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
you treat other people well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it's good to treat other people well.
