that may save the world.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's just a quick introduction to game theory.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This won't hurt. Okay.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
If you ask what kind of a situation

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000

And if you ask what kind of situation

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is conducive to people defining people as enemies,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it's a zero-sum situation.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So, what do those terms mean?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,
