This doesn't bother me so much,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is just that it means that this kind of compassion

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is naturally deployed only within the family.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The bad news is that this kin selected compassion

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is naturally confined to the family.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a second kind of evolutionary logic.
