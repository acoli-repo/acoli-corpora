00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I think it's great that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the leaders of the religions of the world

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that are integral to their faiths.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I think nature gave them a helping hand here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.
