So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's not going to save the world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Are you on the edges of your seats here?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Good, because before I tell you about that good news,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that may save the world.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.
