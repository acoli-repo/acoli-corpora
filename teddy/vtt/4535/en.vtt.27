00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
mutually profitable relationship with people.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
politicians, religious leaders, and us,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of people in very different circumstances.
