00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
underlying the compassion itself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a gene's way of helping itself. OK.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This doesn't bother me so much,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion
