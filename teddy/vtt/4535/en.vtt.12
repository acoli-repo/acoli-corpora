00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
determining who gets excluded from the golden rule --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is we use a much rougher and readier formula.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We all do that,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and you see it all over the world.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
You see it in the Middle East:

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.
