00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of compassion and the golden rule.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as your average compassion talk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to warn you about that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.
