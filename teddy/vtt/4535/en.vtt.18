And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
with some of their friends or allies.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The deployment of the golden rule

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to kind of work their magic.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.
