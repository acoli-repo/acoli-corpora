00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but actually even before that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
even before there were homo sapiens,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
feelings like compassion and love and sympathy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
had earned their way into the gene pool,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It happened through a principle known as kin selection.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the basic idea of kin selection is that,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,
