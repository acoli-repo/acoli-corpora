to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.

Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence
