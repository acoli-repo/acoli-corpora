Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that this non-zero-sum kind of connection

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
can expand the moral compass.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I mean, if you look at the American attitudes

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
toward Japanese during World War II --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
look at the depictions of Japanese

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in the American media as just about subhuman,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
really without giving it much of a thought --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and you compare that to the attitude now,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship
