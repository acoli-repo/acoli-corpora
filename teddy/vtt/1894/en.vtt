00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.841
It's time to start designing for our ears.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.921
Architects and designers tend to focus

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.447
exclusively on these.

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:11.561
They use these to design with and they design for them,

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.889
which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.686
like this â€” (loud crowd noise) â€” and sound like this,

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.233
shouting from a foot away to try and be heard

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.535
by our dinner companion,

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:22.758
or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds,

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:26.601
with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.137
on a cheap stereo system,

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.790
making us jump out of our skins.
