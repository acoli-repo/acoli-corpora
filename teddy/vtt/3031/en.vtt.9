At five months old, she could not
hold her head up like other babies,

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:36.194
but she could hold this deep,
intent eye contact.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.876
One friend said, "She's the most
aware baby I've ever seen."

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:45.478
But where I saw the gift
of her calm, attentive presence,

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:49.855
an occupational therapist who came
over to our house to work with Fiona

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.641
saw a child who was neurologically dull.

00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:55.941
This therapist was especially disappointed

00:04:55.965 --> 00:04:58.345
that Fiona wasn't rolling over yet,

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.628
and so she told me we needed
to wake her neurology up.
