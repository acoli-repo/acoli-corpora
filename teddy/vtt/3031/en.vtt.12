00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.898
I could choose to see
my daughter's differences as bad;

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:04.250
I could strive toward the goal
that her therapists called,

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:05.460
"You'd never know."

00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:08.954
They loved to pat themselves on the back
when they could say about a kid,

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:13.580
"You'd never know he was 'delayed'
or 'autistic' or 'different.'"

00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:17.435
I could believe that the good path
was the path that erased

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.648
as many differences as possible.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.418
Of course, this would have been
a disastrous pursuit,

00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:27.669
because at the cellular level,
my daughter had rare blueprints.

00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:30.228
She wasn't designed
to be like other people.
