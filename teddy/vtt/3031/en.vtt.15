00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:30.499
but then I saw her reaching for something
that her eye had been on all along:

00:07:30.523 --> 00:07:32.169
a black electric cord.

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.574
She was a year old.

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:39.731
Other babies her age were for sure
pulling up to stand and toddling around,

00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:41.055
some of them.

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:45.408
To some, my kid's situation looked bad:

00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:47.329
a one-year-old who could only roll.

00:07:47.353 --> 00:07:48.523
But screw that.

00:07:48.547 --> 00:07:53.247
My kid was enjoying the new,
limber freedom of mobility.

00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:54.421
I rejoiced.

00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:59.901
Then again, what I watched that afternoon
was a baby yanking on an electric cord,

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:01.115
so you know,
