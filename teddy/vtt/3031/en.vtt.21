00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:32.729
This story rears its head
in my daughter's life

00:10:32.753 --> 00:10:33.998
around Christmastime,

00:10:34.022 --> 00:10:36.406
when certain people get positively giddy

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.636
at the thought of seeing her
in angel's wings and a halo

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.088
at the pageant.

00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:46.568
The insinuation is that these people
don't experience the sticky complexities

00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:48.052
of being human.

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:50.934
And although at times,
especially as a baby,

00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.147
my daughter has, in fact, looked angelic,

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:56.505
she has grown into the type of kid

00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:59.814
who does the rascally things
that any other kid does,

00:10:59.838 --> 00:11:04.820
such as when she, at age four,
shoved her two-year-old sister.
