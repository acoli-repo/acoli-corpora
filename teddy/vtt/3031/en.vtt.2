00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:01.583
I first heard this story 20 years ago,

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:04.194
and I have since applied it 100 times.

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:06.143
Didn't get the job I wanted:

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.143
good or bad, hard to say.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:11.274
Got the job I wanted:

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:13.425
good or bad, hard to say.

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:17.226
To me, the story is not about
looking on the bright side

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.636
or waiting to see how things turn out.

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:23.738
It's about how eager we can be
to label a situation,

00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:26.544
to put concrete around it by judging it.

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.968
But reality is much more fluid,

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:34.838
and good and bad are often
incomplete stories that we tell ourselves.
