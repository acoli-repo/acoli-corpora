00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.687
Eventually, my family and I moved
to a new state in America,

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:35.604
and we got lucky with a brand-new
batch of therapists.

00:08:35.628 --> 00:08:39.066
They didn't focus on
all that was wrong with my kid.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.115
They didn't see her differences
as problems to fix.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.638
They acknowledged her limitations,

00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:47.321
but they also saw her strengths,

00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:50.176
and they celebrated her for who she was.

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:54.439
Their goal wasn't to make Fiona
as normal as possible;

00:08:54.463 --> 00:08:58.018
their goal was simply to help her
be as independent as possible

00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:02.355
so that she could fulfill her potential,
however that looked for her.
