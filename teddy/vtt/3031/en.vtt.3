00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:34.838
and good and bad are often
incomplete stories that we tell ourselves.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.252
The parable has been my warning

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:40.900
that by gripping tightly
to the story of good or bad,

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:44.678
I close down my ability
to truly see a situation.

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:48.312
I learn more when I proceed
and loosen my grip

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:51.634
and proceed openly
with curiosity and wonder.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.049
But seven years ago,

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.172
when I was pregnant with my first child,

00:01:57.196 --> 00:02:00.016
I completely forgot this lesson.
