that stereotype is unfair and damaging.

00:09:32.247 --> 00:09:37.362
And sometimes our medical institutions
decide what lives are not worth living.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:39.819
Such is the case with Amelia Rivera,

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:42.052
a girl with my daughter's same syndrome.

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:45.998
In 2012, a famous American
children's hospital

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:50.622
initially denied Amelia the right
to a lifesaving kidney transplant

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:52.610
because, according to their form,

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.503
as it said, she was "mentally retarded."

00:09:55.527 --> 00:09:59.369
This is the way that the story
of disabilities as bad manifests

00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:00.819
in a culture.
