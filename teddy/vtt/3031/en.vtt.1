00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.651
The next day, the farmer's son
rides one of the wild horses,

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.161
is thrown off and breaks his leg.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.490
And the neighbors say,
"Oh, that's terrible luck."

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:41.621
And the farmer says,
"Good or bad, hard to say."

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:45.258
Eventually, officers come
knocking on people's doors,

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:47.941
looking for men to draft for an army,

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:51.538
and they see the farmer's son and his leg
and they pass him by.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:54.118
And neighbors say,
"Ooh, that's great luck!"

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:58.630
And the farmer says,
"Good or bad, hard to say."

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:01.583
I first heard this story 20 years ago,
