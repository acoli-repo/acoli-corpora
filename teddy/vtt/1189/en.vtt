00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's a great honor to be here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's a great honor to be here talking about cities,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
talking about the future of cities.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's great to be here as a mayor.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I really do believe that mayors have the political position

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to really change people's lives.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's the place to be.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Rio's a beautiful city,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a vibrant place, special place.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Actually, you're looking at a guy

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
who has the best job in the world.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I really wanted to share with you
