Helen Tupper: When we met
at university 20 years ago,

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:06.196
we made for unlikely friends.

00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:08.956
I'm an extrovert
who gets involved in everything

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:11.076
and talks to anyone,

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:13.556
Sarah Ellis: ... and I'm
an introverted ideas person

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:17.156
who finds extroverts energizing
but a bit intimidating.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:21.516
HT: Despite our differences, we both had
an ambition to climb the ladder

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.636
and have a successful career.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:27.956
SE: We were motivated by how far
and how fast we could progress,

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:31.916
and we thought that our route to the top
would look something a bit like this.
