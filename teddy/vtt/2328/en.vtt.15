00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:33.846
By exploring how we interface
with these technologies,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.055
we could step out of our habitual,
almost machine-like behavior

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:41.749
and finally find common ground
between each other.

00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:44.704
Technology is never neutral.

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:48.210
It provides a context and frames reality.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:51.122
It's part of the problem
and part of the solution.

00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:57.264
We could use it to uncover our blind spots
and retrain our perception

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:01.455
and consequently, choose
how we see each other.
