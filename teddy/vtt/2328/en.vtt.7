00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.699
it has high visibility

00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:32.001
and it's political.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.653
So what if we take a look

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:36.726
at the last American
presidential election map

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.915
through the helmet?

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:38.947
(Laughter)

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:42.544
You can see that it doesn't matter
if you're a Democrat or a Republican,

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:46.557
because the mediation
alters our perceptions.

00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:49.714
The allergy exists on both sides.

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:52.454
In digital media,

00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:55.611
what we see every day
is often mediated,

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.368
but it's also very nuanced.

00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:59.753
If we are not aware of this,

00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:05.182
we will keep being vulnerable
to many kinds of mental allergies.
