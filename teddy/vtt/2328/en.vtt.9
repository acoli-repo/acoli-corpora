algorithms favor content
that reaffirms our opinions,

00:04:33.092 --> 00:04:37.283
so that every little corner
of our field of view is being colonized

00:04:37.307 --> 00:04:38.649
to sell ads.

00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:43.419
Like, when this little red dot
comes out in your notifications,

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:47.687
it grows and expands,
and to your mind, it's huge.

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.932
So I started to think of ways
to put a little dirt,

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.654
or change the lenses of my glasses,

00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:56.776
and came up with another project.

00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:01.224
Now, keep in mind this is conceptual.
It's not a real product.
