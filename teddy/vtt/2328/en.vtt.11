The plug-in could dilute the things
that are being amplified by an algorithm.

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:38.527
Like, here in this comment section,

00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:41.620
there are lots of people shouting
about the same opinions.

00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:44.981
The plug-in makes
their comments super small.

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:46.013
(Laughter)

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:51.288
So now the amount of pixel presence
they have on the screen

00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:55.866
is proportional to the actual value
they are contributing to the conversation.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.832
(Laughter)

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.976
(Applause)
