I'm an artist and an engineer.

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:09.081
And lately, I've been thinking a lot
about how technology mediates

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:11.146
the way we perceive reality.

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:16.293
And it's being done
in a superinvisible and nuanced way.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.906
Technology is designed
to shape our sense of reality

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.741
by masking itself as
the actual experience of the world.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.116
As a result, we are becoming
unconscious and unaware
