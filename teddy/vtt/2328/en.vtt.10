Now, keep in mind this is conceptual.
It's not a real product.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.749
It's a web browser plug-in

00:05:03.773 --> 00:05:08.115
that could help us to notice
the things that we would usually ignore.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.479
Like the helmet,
the plug-in reshapes reality,

00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:15.900
but this time, directly
into the digital media itself.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.222
It shouts out the hidden filtered voices.

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:21.819
What you should be noticing now

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.352
will be bigger and vibrant,

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:28.671
like here, this story about gender bias
emerging from the sea of cats.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.716
