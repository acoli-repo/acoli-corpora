But the same approach
could be used with bad intentions,

00:07:02.582 --> 00:07:05.787
like forcing citizens
to install a plug-in like that

00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:07.937
to control the public narrative.

00:07:08.768 --> 00:07:11.505
It's challenging to make it
fair and personal

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.684
without it just becoming
another layer of mediation.

00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:18.595
So what does all this mean for us?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.963
Even though technology
is creating this isolation,

00:07:22.987 --> 00:07:26.589
we could use it to make
the world connected again

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:29.860
by breaking the existing model
and going beyond it.
