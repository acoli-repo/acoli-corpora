It simulates this hypersensitivity
by making red things look bigger

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.020
when you are wearing it.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.288
It has two modes: nocebo and placebo.

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:14.629
In nocebo mode, it creates this
sensorial experience of hyperallergy.

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:17.360
Whenever I see red, the red expands.

00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:21.593
It's similar to social media's
amplification effect,

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:24.214
like when you look at something
that bothers you,

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:27.166
you tend to stick with like-minded people

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.785
and exchange messages and memes,
and you become even more angry.
