00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.189
Think about your favorite book or movie.

00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:01.606
Does it follow this pattern?

00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:05.497
Status quo, that's where we start.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:09.531
1:00: Call to Adventure.

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:12.081
The hero receives a mysterious message.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.759
An invitation, a challenge?

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:16.397
2:00: Assistance

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.098
The hero needs some help,
probably from someone older, wiser.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.682
3:00: Departure

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.063
The hero crosses the threshold
from his normal, safe home,

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.054
and enters the special
world and adventure.

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:30.871
We're not in Kansas anymore.
