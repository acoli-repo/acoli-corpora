When her sister's name
is called from the lottery.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.074
How about assistance?

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.438
Is anyone going to help
her on her adventure?

Haymitch.

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.283
What about departure?

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.404
Does she leave her ordinary world?

00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:12.621

What do you have in common

Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo?

00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:20.585
Well, you're human, just like them.

00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:24.873
The Hero's Journey myth
exists in all human cultures

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:26.582
and keeps getting updated,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.868
because we humans reflect on our world

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:31.811
through symbolic stories of our own lives.
