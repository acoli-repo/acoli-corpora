00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.082
This quest has changed the hero;
he has outgrown his old life.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.596
11:00: Resolution

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.042
All the tangled plot lines
get straightened out.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:40.569
12:00: Status Quo,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.756
but upgraded to a new level.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.996
Nothing is quite the same
once you are a hero.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.445
Many popular books and movies

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.153
follow this ancient
formula pretty closely.

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:53.887
But let's see how well "The Hunger Games"
fits the hero's journey template.

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:56.435
When does Katniss Everdeen
hear her call to adventure

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.902
that gets the story moving?

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:00.307
When her sister's name
is called from the lottery.
