00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:31.811
through symbolic stories of our own lives.

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.055
You leave your comfort zone,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.534
have an experience that transforms you,

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:39.477
and then you recover and do it again.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.440
You don't literally slay
dragons or fight Voldemort,

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:46.002
but you face problems just as scary.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:47.219
Joseph Campbell said,

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:50.960
"In the cave you fear to enter
lies the treasure you seek."

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:55.087
What is the symbolic
cave you fear to enter?

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.714
Auditions for the school play?

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:59.242
Baseball tryouts?

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:00.789
Love?
