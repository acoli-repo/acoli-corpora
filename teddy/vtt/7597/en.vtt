00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:13.092
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and... wow, you’re still reeling.

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:17.013
You’re a particle of matter, 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces,

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:18.973
fusion, and annihilation.

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.894
If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter,

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:25.646
you'll be the seed of a future galaxy.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.193
You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game.
