In March 2015, two of us friends
made a pact, an agreement.

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:51.416
We decided that 100 times a year, we would take
out sarees hidden in our closed cupboards

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:54.216
and share stories and memories related

I started the 100 Saree Pact
in honor of my mother.
