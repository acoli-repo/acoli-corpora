00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.429
Now tell me: “How can something that gives

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.459
us a new vision be old fashioned?”

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.439
(Applause)

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:14.910
From this pact, one of my beliefs

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.868
has got strengthened --
that somewhere,

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:21.406
in every story, every experience,
we see a part of our own lives.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.896
I had never thought
that such a simple thing


00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.326
would have led to 
so many new relationships.

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:29.183
We got a glimpse into so many lives,

00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:32.298
and now when we meet it’s
like meeting old friends.
