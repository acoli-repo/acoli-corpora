00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:34.706
With every saree, with every story,
I got to know myself.

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:38.258
The self that had got lost
somewhere over the years.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:44.483
Since all of this was being shared on social media,
the 100 Saree Pact quickly became a large movement.

00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:49.204
People took to the pact,
and the deluge of stories began.

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:51.462
The saree became the medium.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:58.272
From different corners of the world, we started
hearing very personal stories on a public platform.

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:02.608
The more the people, the more the stories,
the more the genre of stories.
