When we wear a saree, we don’t just
wear a garment, we don a history.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.832
It is said that the saree


00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:11.267
is one of the oldest
garments in the world.

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:15.221
In the Indus civilization, we see
proof of a saree-like garment.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:22.456
So it is this history that we can
wear, feel and touch.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.614
In every saree, in its palav, 
its color,

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:27.181
its craftsmanship,clings 
a glimpse of the creator --

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650
their thoughts, their traditions,
and their history.
