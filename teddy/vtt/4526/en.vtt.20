00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:00.083
Here was the idea.

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:03.684
If we can take the virus

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:08.351
and engineer it to amputate
the genetic material in blue here,

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:12.042
this amputated instruction set
can no longer hijack a cell.

00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:16.333
But this amputated instruction set
can do something very special.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.268
In an already infected cell,

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:24.292
this amputated instruction set
can hijack the hijacker.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:30.809
It can commandeer HIV's machinery
to make more copies of itself,
