I wonder if he was trying
to tell me something.

00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:01.917
(Laughter)

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.042
By 2018, things looked bad.

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.809
There was no evidence

00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:11.976
that a hijacker therapy
could be engineered.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.208
In fact, we had evidence
that it might be impossible.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.000
It was time to face the hard truth.

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:22.309
This solution that I'd wanted so badly,

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:25.792
this hijacker therapy just didn't exist.

00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.518
For 20 years,

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:31.500
I had been chasing a ghost.
