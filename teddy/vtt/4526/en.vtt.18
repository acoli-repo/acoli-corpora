00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.059
This genetic material
directs the hijacking process,

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:07.143
converting that cell into a factory first

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:11.268
to make more copies
of the instruction set,

00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:13.601
and then all the other
components of the virus

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.708
and assemble them into a particle.

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.208
This is how the virus replicates.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.809
Each of these particles
can go in and hijack a new cell.

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.268
This is how the virus transmits.

00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:31.226
And every time a cell is hijacked,
