00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.143
It hijacks a cell and converts
that cell into a factory to do one thing:

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.976
single-mindedly churn out more virus.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.143
All the normal functions
of the cell get wiped away.

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:43.476
HIV infects the white blood cell
that keeps us healthy.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.208
This cell has already been hijacked
and converted into a factory.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.726
And if we magnify,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.601
we can see the anatomy of the virus.

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:54.893
Those squiggly red lines in the middle?

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.018
That's HIV's instruction set.

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.458
Its genetic material.
