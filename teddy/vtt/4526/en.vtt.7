Most of us think
that HIV is a solved problem.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.976
We have truly amazing antiviral drugs:

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.684
they're safe and effective,

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.518
and we've spent 15 years

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:41.601
and billions of dollars
deploying these drugs

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.268
around the world.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:45.726
So let's look at the numbers.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.309
In 2019,

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:51.542
1.7 million people acquired HIV.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.559
This number only hit home for me last year

00:03:55.583 --> 00:04:00.333
when I visited this rural village
outside of Durban, South Africa.
