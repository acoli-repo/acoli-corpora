00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.226
It could mutate along with the virus

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.476
and possibly it could transmit
between infected individuals

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.792
to treat them.

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:43.226
It was a therapy that could do
all of the things that the virus could do.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.583
It solved the fundamental mismatch.

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:51.351
The most radical part of this concept

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:54.643
was that the super-spreaders
would also be converted

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:58.333
from transmitting the virus
to now transmitting the therapy.

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:03.292
It was a therapy that would go viral
along with the virus.
