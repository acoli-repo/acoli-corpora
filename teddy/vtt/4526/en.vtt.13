00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.393
Now, conventional wisdom is:

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:37.375
what we need to do is get more drugs
to more people more effectively.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:42.268
I'd argue we need to solve
the fundamental mismatch;

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:44.708
we need to eliminate these barriers.

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:50.309
If we can build therapies
that mutate and transmit,

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.601
we can overcome drug resistance,

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:55.809
overcome adherence barriers,

00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:58.518
and if we do it properly,

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:02.101
we will convert the super-spreaders
from the greatest barrier
