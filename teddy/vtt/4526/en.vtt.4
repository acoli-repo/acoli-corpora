00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.059
This mismatch is why
we're always flat-footed.

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.167
This mismatch is why
we're playing catch-up.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.042
And this mismatch is universal.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.559
It's the reason that we have
antibiotic-resistant infections

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:15.018
that killed 40,000 Americans last year,

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:18.684
and it's the reason that the flu vaccine
couldn't prevent the flu

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:22.208
from killing 60,000 Americans last year.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:28.208
So how do we resolve
this fundamental mismatch?
