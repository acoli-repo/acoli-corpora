00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.518
The fundamental problem that we face
in controlling these outbreaks

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:35.434
is that viruses and other infections
do two things really well:

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:36.708
they mutate

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.708
and they transmit.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.434
Our medical tools
do neither of these two things.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:48.559
Our medical tools
don't mutate or transmit.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:52.476
We have a fundamental mismatch
between our tools,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.143
which are static,

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:56.292
and the infections, which are dynamic.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.059
This mismatch is why
we're always flat-footed.
