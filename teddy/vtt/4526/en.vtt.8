00:03:55.583 --> 00:04:00.333
when I visited this rural village
outside of Durban, South Africa.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.726
I was driving along this dirt road

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.643
with my 10-year-old daughter
in the back seat,

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:10.809
and walking next to us
on the side of the road were girls,

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.976
the same age as my daughter,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.643
barefoot.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.184
My daughter asked about
why these girls are barefoot

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.309
and I had to explain disparity to her,

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.917
which was hard.

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:27.309
But what really shocked me
was when my colleagues,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.143
the local African scientists
explained to me
