00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.143
the local African scientists
explained to me

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.726
that these young girls
the same age as my daughter --

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.018
(Breathes)

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:36.476
sorry --

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.417
had an 80 percent chance
of acquiring HIV in their lifetime.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:43.976
It blew me away.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.518
How can these girls
have an 80 percent risk

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.875
if we have safe and effective drugs?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.292
The reason is the fundamental mismatch.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.601
It creates barriers
to controlling infectious disease,

00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:00.000
particularly in resource-limited settings.
