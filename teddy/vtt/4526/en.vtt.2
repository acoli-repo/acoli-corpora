00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.601
There won't be a vaccine
for at least 12 months.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.934
And this virus is mutating,

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.434
so there's no guarantee that the vaccine
that we produce 12 months from now

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.042
will match the mutated virus.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.434
We're always playing catch-up.

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:18.934
And this is the scenario we're in
every time there's an outbreak.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.184
Our quarantines are porous,

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.417
our medical responses are flat-footed.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.518
The fundamental problem that we face
in controlling these outbreaks
