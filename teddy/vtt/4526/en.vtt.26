00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.809
If it ever worked,

00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:04.792
it would solve the fundamental mismatch.

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:08.768
So we tried for years to build it.

00:13:08.792 --> 00:13:12.143
We tried every trick in the book

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.750
and failed over and over again.

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:17.351
We --

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:19.351
every time we thought we had a good idea,

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:22.083
we'd spend months,
sometimes years working on it

00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:24.583
only to come up empty.

00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:29.809
We once spent five years

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:34.125
building 150,000 versions
of a hijacker therapy.
