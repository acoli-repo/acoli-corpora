00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:00.591
Well then, we get to 67.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.095
And now let's be even bolder still.

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:08.575
What if every country in the world
chose to be like Costa Rica

00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:10.969
in prioritizing human well-being,

00:11:10.993 --> 00:11:13.575
using its wealth for the well-being
of its citizens?

00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:17.818
Well then, we get to nearly 73,
very close to the Global Goals.

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:20.575
Can we achieve the Global Goals?

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.801
Certainly not with business as usual.

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:27.629
Even a flood tide of economic growth
is not going to get us there,

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.716
if it just raises the mega-yachts
and the super-wealthy
