00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:34.668
The lowest performing country,
Central African Republic, scores 31.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.695
And we can add up
all the countries together,

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.153
weighting for the different
population sizes,

00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:43.575
and that global score is 61.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.311
In concrete terms,

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:49.093
that means that the average human being
is living on a level of social progress

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:52.539
about the same of Cuba
or Kazakhstan today.

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.785
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.428
What do we have to get to
to achieve the Global Goals?
