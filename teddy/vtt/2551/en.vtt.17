00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.868
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.

00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:35.042
Let me take you back
to that regression line.

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:38.446
So this is the average relationship
between GDP and social progress,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.356
and this is what our
last forecast was based on.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.713
But as you saw already,

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:47.662
there is actually lots of noise
around this trend line.

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.908
What that tells us, quite simply,

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:54.035
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.067
We have countries that are underperforming

00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:59.740
on social progress,
relative to their wealth.
