00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.575
Did we hit this target?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.050
Well, no, we didn't.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.280
We exceeded it.

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:10.860
This year, global poverty
is going to fall to 12 percent.

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:13.575
Now, that's still not good enough,

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.218
and the world does still have
plenty of problems.

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:22.677
But the pessimists and doomsayers
who say that the world can't get better

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.010
are simply wrong.

00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:27.575
So how did we achieve this success?

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.740
Well, a lot of it was because
of economic growth.
