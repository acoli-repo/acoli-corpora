00:05:00.254 --> 00:05:02.742
Now, the Global Goals
are certainly ambitious,

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.800
but they're not about turning the world
into Norway in just 15 years.

00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.494
So having looked at the numbers,
my estimate is that a score of 75

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.575
would not only be a giant leap forward
in human well-being,

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.721
it would also count as hitting
the Global Goals target.

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:22.198
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:24.251
Can we get there?

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:27.259
Well, the Social Progress Index
can help us calculate this,

00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:28.949
because as you might have noticed,

00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:31.198
there are no economic indicators in there;
