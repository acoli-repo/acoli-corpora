00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:01.159
And we need to hold them to that promise
by holding them accountable,

00:12:01.183 --> 00:12:04.474
tracking their progress all the way
through the next 15 years.

00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:06.610
And I want to finish by showing you

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:09.399
a way to do that, called
the People's Report Card.

00:12:09.423 --> 00:12:14.330
The People's Report Card brings together
all this data into a simple framework

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:16.894
that we'll all be familiar
with from our school days,

00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:18.346
to hold them to account.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.625
It grades our performance
on the Global Goals

00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:24.120
on a scale from F to A,

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:29.237
where F is humanity at its worst,
and A is humanity at its best.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.461
Our world today is scoring a C-.
