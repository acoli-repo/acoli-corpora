Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
were in countries such as China and India,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.461
which have seen rapid
economic growth in recent years.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.575

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.467
Can economic growth
get us to the Global Goals?

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:50.381
Well, to answer that question,

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:54.575
we need to benchmark where the world
is today against the Global Goals

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.173
and figure out how far we have to travel.

00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.949
But that ain't easy,

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:02.790
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,
