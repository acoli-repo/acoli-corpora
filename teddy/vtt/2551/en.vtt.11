00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:31.198
there are no economic indicators in there;

00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:35.699
there's no GDP or economic growth
in the Social Progress Index model.

00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:39.575
And what that lets us do
is understand the relationship

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.883
between economic growth
and social progress.

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.369
Let me show you on this chart.

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:48.575
So here on the vertical axis,
I've put social progress,

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.167
the stuff the Global Goals
are trying to achieve.

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.737
Higher is better.

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.145
And then on the horizontal axis,
is GDP per capita.

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.708
Further to the right means richer.

00:05:58.732 --> 00:06:02.032
And in there, I'm now going to put
all the countries of the world,
