00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:33.162
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.853
Because back in 2001,

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:40.397
the UN agreed another set of goals,
the Millennium Development Goals.

00:01:41.138 --> 00:01:45.338
And the flagship target there
was to halve the proportion of people

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:48.313
living in poverty by 2015.

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:52.889
The target was to take
from a baseline of 1990,

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:56.575
when 36 percent of the world's
population lived in poverty,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.792
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.
