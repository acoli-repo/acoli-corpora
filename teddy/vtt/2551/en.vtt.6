00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:02.790
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.069
they're also pretty complicated.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.743
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.452
and literally hundreds of indicators.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:17.048
Also, while some of the goals
are pretty specific --

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.495
end hunger --

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.415
others are a lot vaguer --

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.041
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.

00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:25.849
So to help us with this benchmarking,

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:29.619
I'm going to use a tool
called the Social Progress Index.
