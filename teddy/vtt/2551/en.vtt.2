00:00:56.247 --> 00:01:00.007
Well, I'm here today because
we've run the numbers,

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.575
and the answer, shockingly,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.043
is that maybe we actually can.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.702
But not with business as usual.

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:14.812
Now, the idea that the world
is going to get a better place

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.741
may seem a little fanciful.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.575
Watch the news every day and the world
seems to be going backwards, not forwards.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.297
And let's be frank:

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.575
it's pretty easy to be skeptical
about grand announcements

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.018
coming out of the UN.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:33.162
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.
