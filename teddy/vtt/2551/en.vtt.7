What this does is measures all the stuff
the Global Goals are trying to achieve,

00:03:34.144 --> 00:03:38.306
but sums it up into a single number
that we can use as our benchmark

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.479
and track progress over time.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.453
The Social Progress Index basically asks
three fundamental questions

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:45.738
about a society.

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:49.679
First of all, does everyone have
the basic needs of survival:

00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:52.511
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.289
Secondly, does everyone have
the building blocks of a better life:

00:03:56.313 --> 00:04:00.574
education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?
