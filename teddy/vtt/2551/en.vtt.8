education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?

00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:04.839
And does everyone have
the opportunity to improve their lives,

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:08.863
through rights, freedom of choice,
freedom from discrimination,

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:11.590
and access to the world's
most advanced knowledge?

00:04:12.463 --> 00:04:16.575
The Social Progress Index sums all this
together using 52 indicators

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.531
to create an aggregate score
on a scale of 0 to 100.

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.599
And what we find is that there's
a wide diversity of performance

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:25.784
in the world today.

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.718
The highest performing country,
Norway, scores 88.
