00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:01.764
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.

00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:04.780
We've used up the easy wins
from economic growth,

00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:07.152
and now we're moving on
to harder problems.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.038
And also, we know that economic growth
comes with costs as well as benefits.

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:16.586
There are costs to the environment, costs
from new health problems like obesity.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.110
So that's the bad news.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:23.441
We're not going to get to the Global Goals
just by getting richer.

00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.033
So are the pessimists right?

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:27.941
Well, maybe not.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.868
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.
