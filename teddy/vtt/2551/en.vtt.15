00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.238
social progress is going to increase

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:36.625
from 61 to 62.4.

00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:38.839
(Laughter)

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:43.362
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.

00:07:44.315 --> 00:07:45.862
Now this seems a bit strange.

00:07:45.886 --> 00:07:48.098
Economic growth seems
to have really helped

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:49.811
in the fight against poverty,

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.035
but it doesn't seem
to be having much impact

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.142
on trying to get to the Global Goals.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:55.761
So what's going on?

00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:57.873
Well, I think there are two things.

00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:01.764
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.
