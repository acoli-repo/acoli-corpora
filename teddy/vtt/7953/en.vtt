00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.999
I'm a proud lifelong nerd,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.502
and I have a PhD in chemistry
and chemical biology to prove it,

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.547
which is why I never thought
I'd be that guy standing up here,

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.008
talking about my love affair with fashion.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.217
(Laughter)

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.927
And there's someone else in my life

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:17.138
who's equally shocked
by this turn of events,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.432
and that's my wonderful wife,

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:21.976
who literally has a degree in fashion.

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:23.227
(Laughter)

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:26.731
But here I am, standing
with these two wallets.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.443
One of these is made out of leather,
