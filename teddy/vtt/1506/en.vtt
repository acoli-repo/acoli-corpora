00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.230
I'm going to talk about
the strategizing brain.

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.640
We're going to use an unusual
combination of tools

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:07.254
from game theory and neuroscience

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.548
to understand how people interact socially
when value is on the line.

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:14.044
So game theory is a branch of,
originally, applied mathematics,

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:17.496
used mostly in economics and political
science, a little bit in biology,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.363
that gives us a mathematical
taxonomy of social life,

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.706
and it predicts what people
are likely to do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.046
and believe others will do

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.043
in cases where everyone's actions
affect everyone else.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:30.752
That's a lot of things: competition,
cooperation, bargaining,
