00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that was worth solving

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
where you knew all of the given information in advance;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or you didn't have sufficient information

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and had to go find some.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we have problems like this right here

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
it helpfully explains to you
