00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Can I ask you to please recall a time

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when you really loved something --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a movie, an album, a song or a book --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you recommended it wholeheartedly

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to someone you also really liked,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it came back, and the person hated it?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, by way of introduction,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is the exact same state

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I teach high school math.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I sell a product to a market

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
