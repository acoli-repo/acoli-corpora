00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and presented to the student all at once,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
how that creates this impatient problem solving.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I'll define them here: You have the visual.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You also have the mathematical structure,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
talking about grids, measurements, labels,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
points, axes, that sort of thing.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which section is the steepest.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So I hope you can see.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but we're paving a smooth, straight path

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
from one to the other

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and congratulating our students for how well

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
they can step over the small cracks in the way.
