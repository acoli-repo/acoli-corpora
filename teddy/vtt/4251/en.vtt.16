00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because, like the intro,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
because someone else has the formula;

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
so I won't talk about it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Everyone's filled something up with water before,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
joining the conversation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,
