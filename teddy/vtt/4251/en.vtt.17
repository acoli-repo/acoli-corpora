00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
joining the conversation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and kids have bought in here.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And then we follow the process I've described.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And the best part here, or one of the better parts

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
in the back of the teacher's edition.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And that's terrifying,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because the theoretical models that always work out

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that's great, but

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
it's scary to talk about sources of error

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But those conversations have been so valuable,
