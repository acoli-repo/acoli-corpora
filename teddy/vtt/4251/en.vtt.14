00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Students need to decide, "All right, well,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So now we have a water tank.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And because this is the 21st century

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
not in terms of line art or clip art

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that you so often see in textbooks,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
we go out and we take a picture of it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So now we have the real deal.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
How long will it take it to fill it up?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then even better is we take a video,
