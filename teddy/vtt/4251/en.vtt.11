00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And then eventually we realize

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it's getting annoying to talk about

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
or the skier just above the mid line.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And we realize how great would it be

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to talk about them more easily.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then and only then,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
we throw down that mathematical structure.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The math serves the conversation,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the conversation doesn't serve the math.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes
