It's buying you out of your obligation,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is because we have the tools to create

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and the tools to distribute it

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
freely under open licenses

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
