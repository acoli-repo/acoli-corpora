00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and patient problem solving,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It applies equally to math.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Notice, first of all here,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
each of which will figure into a formula

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
somewhere, eventually,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which the student will then compute.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I believe in real life.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that was worth solving
