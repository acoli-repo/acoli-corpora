00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and congratulating our students for how well

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
they can step over the small cracks in the way.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's all we're doing here.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and build them up with students,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So right here I start with the visual,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I immediately ask the question:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Which section is the steepest?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And this starts conversation

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So you get people arguing against each other,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
friend versus friend,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in pairs, journaling, whatever.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And then eventually we realize

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it's getting annoying to talk about
