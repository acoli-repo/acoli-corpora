saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
which, wow.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I put this problem on my blog recently:

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the one that has one cart and 19 items

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
which is just bizarre, right?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And from all of this, I can only conclude

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that people, not just students,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
are really hungry for this.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Math makes sense of the world.
