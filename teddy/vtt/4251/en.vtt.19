We're no longer intimidated by math,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because we're slowly redefining what math is.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This has been a lot of fun.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because it brings the real world into your classroom

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in high resolution and full color;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to ask the shortest question you possibly can

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to let students build the problem,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because Einstein said so;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's buying you out of your obligation,
