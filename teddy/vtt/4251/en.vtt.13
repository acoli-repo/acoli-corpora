00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So 90 percent of what I do

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
with my five hours of prep time per week

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is to take fairly compelling elements

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
of problems like this from my textbook

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And here's how it works.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I like this question. It's about a water tank.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Students have to develop those,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
they have to formulate those.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Students need to decide, "All right, well,
