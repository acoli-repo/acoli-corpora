00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For example, factoring quadratics with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
leading coefficients greater than one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
provided you have a really strong grounding

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in reasoning. Math reasoning --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we'll call it the application

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of math processes to the world around us --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
this is hard to teach.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is what we would love students to retain,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all but ensures they won't retain it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time
