00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But if you need to,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
your students can then develop those substeps together.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
who, I believe, has paid his dues.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we just give problems to students;

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
