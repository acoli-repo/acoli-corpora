00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to be a math teacher.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So first, five symptoms

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that you're doing math reasoning wrong

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in your classroom.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You finish your lecture block

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and immediately you have five hands going up

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Students lack perseverance.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They lack retention; you find yourself

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There's an aversion to word problems,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which describes 99 percent of my students.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And then the other one percent
