00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a useful stereotype about you all.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I could give you guys

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
an algebra-two final exam,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I would expect no higher

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
than a 25 percent pass rate.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And both of these facts say less about you or my students

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
than they do about what we call math education

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in the U.S. today.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
