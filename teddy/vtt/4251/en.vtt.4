00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And then the other one percent

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is eagerly looking for the formula

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to apply in that situation.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is really destructive.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
has a really good description for this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
He swore off creating

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
contemporary drama,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
shows set in the present day,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because he saw that when people fill their mind

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in such a way that they expect simple problems.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
