00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
it helpfully explains to you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You could literally, I mean this,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's about defining steepness and slope

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
using a ski lift.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and presented to the student all at once,
