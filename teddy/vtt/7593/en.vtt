00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:03.066
I need to start by telling you a little bit

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.555
about my social life,

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:07.473
which I know may not seem relevant,

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.220
but it is.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.150
When people meet me at parties

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.342
and they find out that I'm an English professor

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.739
who specializes in language,

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.189
they generally have one of two reactions.

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.378
One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:25.971
They often say something like,

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:29.277
"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.

00:00:29.277 --> 00:00:32.495
I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."
