00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In his inaugural address,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But what did he appeal to?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and tell us to just go shopping.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Invest, invest, invest."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
