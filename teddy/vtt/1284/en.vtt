00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was excited, with this phone call.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I went to bed that night pretty excited.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Not sure of all the details, but excited.
