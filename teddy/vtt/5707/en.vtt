00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.055
Have you ever seen something

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:05.795
and you wish you could have said something

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.076
but you didn't?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.010
A second question I have is:
Has something ever happened to you

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.226
and you never said anything about it,

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:18.698
though you should have?

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.895
I'm interested in this idea of action,

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.526
of the difference between
seeing something,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.526
which is basically passively observing,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.805
and the actual act of bearing witness.
