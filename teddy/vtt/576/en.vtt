00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.167
I'm an historian.

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:06.208
And what I love about being an historian
is it gives you perspective.

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:11.206
Today, I'd like to bring that perspective
to education in the United States.

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.493
About the only thing people can agree on

00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:18.374
is that the most strategic time
for a child to start learning

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:19.871
is early.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.270
Over 50 years ago,

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:24.784
there was a watershed moment
in early education in the US

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.120
called "Head Start."

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:28.668
Now, historians love watersheds

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:31.899
because it makes it so easy
to talk about what came before
