his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.071
He would make many melancholy reflections

00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.261
upon the precariousness of human life,

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.275
and when all these humane sentiments

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:10.118
had been once fairly expressed,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.519
with the same ease and tranquility

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.611
as if no such accident had happened.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.432
but provided he never saw them,

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:24.870
he would snore with the most profound security

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.779
over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.682
