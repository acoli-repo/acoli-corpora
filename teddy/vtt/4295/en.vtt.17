00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.504
But just those arguments had to be made,

00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:34.253
and they were, in centuries past.

00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:36.005
SP: Are you saying that people needed

00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:38.053
a step-by-step argument to grasp

00:08:38.053 --> 00:08:40.112
why something might be a wee bit wrong

00:08:40.112 --> 00:08:41.890
with burning heretics at the stake?

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.807

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.384
and other sects say that they are.

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:52.657
Who shall be judge?

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.095
If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:58.114
But then, why does he write so
many books about manifest truth?

00:08:58.114 --> 00:09:00.650
In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics
