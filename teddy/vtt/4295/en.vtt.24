00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.387
that will not hold more strongly for the other,

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.820
if all men are born free,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.209
how is it that all women are born slaves,

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:06.637
as they must be if being subjected

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:08.675
to the inconstant, uncertain,

00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:11.195
unknown, arbitrary will of men

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:14.095
be the perfect condition of slavery?

00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:16.028
RNG: That sort of co-option

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:18.594
is all in the job description of reason.

00:12:18.594 --> 00:12:20.769
One movement for the expansion of rights

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:24.659
inspires another because the logic is the same,

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:26.558
and once that's hammered home,

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:29.092
it becomes increasingly uncomfortable

00:12:29.092 --> 00:12:31.286
to ignore the inconsistency.
