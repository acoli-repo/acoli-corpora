00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.893
As far as empathy is concerned,

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:34.426
ugly outsiders can go to hell.

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:37.829
And even our best attempts to work up sympathy

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:39.813
for those who are unconnected with us

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:44.012
fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:46.566
that was pointed out by Adam Smith.

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:48.347
Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.962
of China was suddenly swallowed
up by an earthquake,

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:53.552
and let us consider how a 
man of humanity in Europe

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.254
would react on receiving intelligence

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.317
of this dreadful calamity.

00:05:57.317 --> 00:05:59.534
He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:02.194
his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.
