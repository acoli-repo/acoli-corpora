Perhaps reason is overrated.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.438
Many pundits have argued that a good heart

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.388
and steadfast moral clarity

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:09.626
are superior to triangulations
of overeducated policy wonks,

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:12.291
like the best and brightest and that dragged us

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.153
into the quagmire of Vietnam.

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:15.975
And wasn't it reason that gave us the means

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.705
to despoil the planet

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.726
and threaten our species with
weapons of mass destruction?

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.965
In this way of thinking, 
it's character and conscience,

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:27.091
not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.956
Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.
