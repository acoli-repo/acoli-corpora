Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.597
that respond to other people's actions

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:04.664
the same way they respond to our own.

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.391
Empathy emerges early in life,

00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:08.274
perhaps before the age of one.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.917
Books on empathy have become bestsellers,

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.931
like "The Empathic Civilization"

00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:14.111

But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.347
for making moral progress.

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:24.534
For one thing, it's innately biased

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:26.660
toward blood relations, babies

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.494
and warm, fuzzy animals.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.893
As far as empathy is concerned,
