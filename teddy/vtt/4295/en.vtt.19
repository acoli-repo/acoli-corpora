00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:31.802
that surround them, become hardened,

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:34.647
and after a hundred years of cruel punishments,

00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:36.839
breaking on the wheel causes no more fear

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.983
than imprisonment previously did.

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:41.030
For a punishment to achieve its objective,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.770
it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.829
outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:48.937
and into this calculation ought to be factored

00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:50.603
the certainty of punishment

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:51.741
and the loss of the good

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.376
that the commission of the crime will produce.

00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.168
Everything beyond this is superfluous,

00:09:56.168 --> 00:09:58.119
and therefore tyrannical.

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.469
