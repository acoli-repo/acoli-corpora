00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.438
a momentous historical development

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.305
that I spoke about five years ago here at TED?

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.950
Namely, we seem to be getting more humane.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.310
Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.570
as a form of popular entertainment.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.449
Knights waged constant war on each other

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.615
by trying to kill as many of each
other's peasants as possible.

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:49.290
Governments executed people for frivolous reasons,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.700
like stealing a cabbage

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.948
or criticizing the royal garden.

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:55.201
The executions were designed to be as prolonged

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.139
and as painful as possible, like crucifixion,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.233
disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.
