00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:30.679
But this practice produces not pain of any kind

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.313
to anyone.

00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:34.779
SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.638
for the arguments of these great thinkers

00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:40.043
to trickle down and infiltrate
the population as a whole.

00:13:40.043 --> 00:13:42.522
It kind of makes you wonder about our own time.

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:44.491
Are there practices that we engage in

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.286
where the arguments against
them are there for all to see

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:49.575
but nonetheless we persist in them?

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:52.567
RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:55.782
will they be as appalled by some of our practices

00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:59.441
as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,

00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:02.529
wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?
