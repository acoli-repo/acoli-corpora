00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.486
We all care passionately

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.750
about our own well-being.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.583
The second condition is that reasoners

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.068
are members of a community of reasoners

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:10.142
who can affect one another's well-being,

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:11.655
can exchange messages,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:14.483

and loquatious species,

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.337
well endowed with the instinct for language.

00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:24.659
SP: Well, that sounds good in theory,

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.673
but has it worked that way in practice?

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.507
In particular, can it explain

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.438
a momentous historical development
