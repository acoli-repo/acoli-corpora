By the very act of trying to
reason us into your position,

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:05.366
you're conceding reason's potency.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.372
Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:09.770
You show up for that debate

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.612
and you've already lost it.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.327
SP: But can reason lead us in directions

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.999
that are good or decent or moral?

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.510
After all, you pointed out that reason

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.284
is just a means to an end,

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.750
and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.317
Reason can lay out a road
map to peace and harmony

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.173
if the reasoner wants peace and harmony,

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:32.000
but it can also lay out a road
map to conflict and strife
