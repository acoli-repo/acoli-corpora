00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.233
disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:02.299
Respectable people kept slaves.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.272
For all our flaws, we have abandoned

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:05.765
these barbaric practices.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.533
RNG: So, do you think it's
human nature that's changed?

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:11.318
SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.917
that can erupt in violence,

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:17.287
like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.286
But we also have instincts that can steer us away,

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:23.778
like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:25.054
what Abraham Lincoln called

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:26.643
the better angels of our nature.

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:28.685
RNG: So if human nature didn't change,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.684
what invigorated those better angels?
