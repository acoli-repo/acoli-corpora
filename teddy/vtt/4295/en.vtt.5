00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:32.000
but it can also lay out a road
map to conflict and strife

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.677
if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.

00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:37.003
Can reason force the reasoner to want

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.312
less cruelty and waste?

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:42.584
RNG: All on its own, the answer is no,

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:45.345
but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:47.699
You need two conditions:

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.258
The first is that reasoners all care

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:51.968
about their own well-being.

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:54.864
That's one of the passions that has to be present

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:57.068
in order for reason to go to work,

00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:58.956
and it's obviously present in all of us.

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.486
We all care passionately
