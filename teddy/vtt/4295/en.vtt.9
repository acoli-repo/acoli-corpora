00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.684
what invigorated those better angels?

00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:32.217
SP: Well, among other things,

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:34.359
our circle of empathy expanded.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:36.806
Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:39.279
only of their family and people in their village.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.081
But with the expansion of literacy and travel,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.007
people started to sympathize

00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:45.672
with wider and wider circles,

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:48.553
the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:51.508
and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.

00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:53.714
RNG: Can hard-headed scientists

00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:56.735
really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.416
SP: They can and do.

00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:00.417
Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain
