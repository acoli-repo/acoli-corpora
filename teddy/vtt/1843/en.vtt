00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:03.057
I'm going to talk about consciousness.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.537
Why consciousness?

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.363
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject,

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:10.927
both in our scientific
and our philosophical culture.

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.199
Now why is that curious?

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.709
Well, it is the most important
aspect of our lives

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.667
for a very simple, logical reason,

00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.064
namely, it's a necessary
condition on anything

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:22.541
being important in our lives
that we're conscious.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:25.700
You care about science, philosophy,
music, art, whatever --

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:29.178
it's no good if you're
a zombie or in a coma, right?

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.522
So consciousness is number one.
