00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.816
to also control them?

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.816
So, first of all I would like to tell you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.080
that actually mosquitoes mate
in what we call swarms.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.856
Male mosquitoes usually congregate

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.080
in clusters around the horizon,
usually after sunset.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.616
The males go there for a dance,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.296
the females fly into that dance

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.056
and select a male mosquito
of their choice,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.856
usually the best-looking
male in their view.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.256
They clump together
and fall down onto the floor.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.936
If you watch this, it's beautiful.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.976
It's a fantastic phenomenon.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.216
This is where our mosquito-catching
work gets really interesting.
