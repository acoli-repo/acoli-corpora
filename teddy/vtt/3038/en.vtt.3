30 kilometers south
of Ifakara town across the river.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.136
Every evening we went into the villages
with flashlights and siphons.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.720
We rolled up our trousers,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.696
and waited for mosquitoes
that were coming to bite us

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.296
so we could collect them

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.178
to check if they were carrying malaria.

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:47.216
(Laughter)

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.416
My colleague and myself
selected a household,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.280
and we started inside and outside,
swapping positions every half hour.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.200
And we did this for 12 hours every night
for 24 consecutive nights.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.576
We slept for four hours every morning
