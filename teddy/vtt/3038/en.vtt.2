00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.176
My home institution,
Ifakara Health Institute,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.176
began in this valley in the 1950s

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280
to address priority health needs
for the local communities.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.480
In fact, the name Ifakara
refers to a place you go to die,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.696
which is a reflection
of what life used to be here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320
in the days before
organized public health care.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.496
When I first moved here,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.016
my primary role was to estimate

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.560
how much malaria transmission
was going on across the villages

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.920
and which mosquitoes
were transmitting the disease.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.096
So my colleague and myself came

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.200
30 kilometers south
of Ifakara town across the river.
