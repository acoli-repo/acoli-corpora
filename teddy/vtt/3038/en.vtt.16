00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.216
to control many other diseases,
including, of course, the malaria,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.816
but also those other diseases
that mosquitoes transmit

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.040
like dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.936
And this is why my colleagues,
for example --

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.216
we have looked at the fact

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.816
that some mosquitoes
like to bite you on the leg region.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.800
And we've now created
these mosquito repellent sandals

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.960
that tourists and locals can wear
when they're coming.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.896
And you don't get bitten --

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.920
this gives you 'round the clock protection

00:08:24.944 --> 00:08:27.096
until the time you go under your bednet.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.976
(Applause)

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.576
My love-hate relationship
with mosquitoes continues.
