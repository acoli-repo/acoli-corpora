Once we identified these substances,
we created a concoction,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.496
kind of a mixture,
a blend of synthetic substances

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.176
that are reminiscent
of what you produce from your body.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.376
And we made a synthetic blend

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.480
that was attracting three to five times
more mosquitoes than a human being.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.696
What can you do with this?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.976
You put in a trap, lure a lot
of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.456
And of course, you can also
use it for surveillance.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.256
At Ifakara

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.360
we wish to expand our knowledge
on the biology of the mosquito;

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.216
to control many other diseases,
including, of course, the malaria,
