00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.936
that we can use together
with things such as bednets

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.256
to be able to get to zero.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.456
And I'm going to share
with you a few examples

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.680
of the things that
my colleagues and myself do.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.216
Take this, for example.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.080
Mosquitoes breed in small pools of water.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.016
Not all of them are easy to find --

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.296
they can be scattered across villages,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.840
they can be as small as hoofprints.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.616
They can be behind your house
or far from your house.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.216
And so, if you wanted
to control mosquito larvae,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.640
it can actually be
quite difficult to get them.
