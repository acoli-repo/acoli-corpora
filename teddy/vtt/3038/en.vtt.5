00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.360
But I do this mostly to improve
people's lives and well-being.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.576
This has been called by some people
the most dangerous animal on earth --

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.656
which unfortunately is true.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.240
But what do we really
know about mosquitoes?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.760
It turns out we actually know very little.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.416
Consider the fact that at the moment
our best practice against malaria

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.216
are bednets --
insecticide treated bednets.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.816
We know now that across Africa

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.776
you have widespread resistance
to insecticides.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.536
And these are the same insecticides,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.000
the pyrethroid class,
that are put on these bednets.
