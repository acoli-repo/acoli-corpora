00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.000
the pyrethroid class,
that are put on these bednets.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.656
We know now that these bednets
protect you from bites

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.560
but only minimally kill
the mosquitoes that they should.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.216
What it means is that we've got to do more
to be able to get to zero.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.760
And that's part of our duty.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.256
At Ifakara Health Institute

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.456
we focus very much
on the biology of the mosquito,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.176
and we try to do this
so we can identify new opportunities.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.536
A new approach.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.416
New ways to try and get new options

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.936
that we can use together
with things such as bednets
