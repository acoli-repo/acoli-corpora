That's 2,555 infectious bites every year.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.976
When I was in college,
I moved to the Kilombero River valley

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.656
in the southeastern part of Tanzania.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.816
This is historically
one of the most malarious zones

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.536
in the world at that time.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000
Life here was difficult.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.776
In its later stages

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600
malaria manifested with extreme seizures
locally known as degedege.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.056
It's killed both women and men,
adults and children,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.856
without mercy.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.176
