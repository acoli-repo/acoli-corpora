00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.576
that we can use
in addition to what we have now

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.256
to eventually go to zero.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.936
This is important.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.936
Now, of course people always ask us --

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.296
which is a common question,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.376
I guess you're going
to ask this as well --

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.456
"What happens if you
eliminate mosquitoes?"

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.096
KK: I won't ask then, you answer.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.176
FO: OK. In respect to this,
I would just like to remind my colleagues

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.616
that we have 3,500
mosquito species in this world.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.936
Maybe more than that.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.976
About 400 of these are Anophelenes,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.856
and only about 70 of them
have any capacity to transmit malaria.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.656
In Africa, we're having to deal with
three or four of these as the major guys.
