What my colleagues
and I have decided to do

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.216
is to think about what if
we used mosquitoes themselves

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.336
to carry the insecticides
from a place of our choice

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.256
to their own breeding habitats

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.880
so that whichever eggs
they lay there shall not survive.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.055
This is Dickson Lwetoijera.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.776
This is my colleague
who runs this show at Ifakara.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.056
And he has demonstrated cleverly
that you can actually get mosquitoes

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.816
to come to the place
where they normally come to get blood

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.896
to pick up a dose
of sterilants or insecticide,
