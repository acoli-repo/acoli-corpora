mosquitoes actually smell you.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.256
And they have developed

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.320

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.440
They can smell from as far

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.536
They know who you are

sweat and body odor.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.776

is to identify what it is in your skin,
your body, your sweat or your breath

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.766
that these mosquitoes like.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.336
Once we identified these substances,
we created a concoction,
