00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.576
We slept for four hours every morning

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.096
and worked the rest of the day,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.136
sorting mosquitoes, identifying them
and chopping off their heads

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.896
so they could be analyzed in the lab

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.175
to check if they were
carrying malaria parasites

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.776
in their blood mouthparts.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.776
This way we were able to not only know
how much malaria was going on here

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.696
but also which mosquitoes
were carrying this malaria.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.976
We were also able to know

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.776
whether malaria was mostly
inside houses or outside houses.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.960
Today, ladies and gentlemen,
I still catch mosquitoes for a living.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.360
But I do this mostly to improve
people's lives and well-being.
