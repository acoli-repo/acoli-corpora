00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.896
to pick up a dose
of sterilants or insecticide,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.056
carry this back
to their own breeding habitat

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.680
and kill all their progeny.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.136
And we have demonstrated
that you can do this

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.440
and crush populations very, very rapidly.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.160
This is beautiful.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.720
This is our mosquito city.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.256
It is the largest mosquito farm

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.560
available in the world
for malaria research.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.056
Here we have large-scale self-sustaining
colonies of malaria mosquitoes

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.696
that we rear in these facilities.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.536
Of course, they are disease-free.
