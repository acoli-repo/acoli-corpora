00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.216
This is where our mosquito-catching
work gets really interesting.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.936
What we have seen, when we go
swarm hunting in the villages,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.496
is that these swarm locations
tend to be at exactly the same location

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.976
every day, every week, every month,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.536
year in, year out.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.736
They start at exactly
the same time of the evening,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.176
and they are at exactly
the same locations.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.456
What does this tell us?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.736
It means that if we can map
all these locations across villages,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.376
we could actually

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.536
crush these populations
by just a single blow.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.520
Kind of, you know, bomb-spray them
or nuke them out.
