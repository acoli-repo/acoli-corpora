In Africa, we're having to deal with
three or four of these as the major guys.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.496
They carry most -- like 99 percent
of all the malaria we have.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.416
If we were to go out
with gene editing like CRISPR,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.136
if we were to go out
with gene drives to control malaria,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.256
we would be going after only one or two.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.776
I don't see a diversity problem with that.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.176
But that's personal view.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.416
I think it's OK.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.696
And remember, by the way,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.416
all these years we've been trying
to eliminate these mosquitoes effectively

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.496
by spraying them -- our colleagues
in America have sprayed with --

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.136
really bomb-spraying
these insects out of the villages.
