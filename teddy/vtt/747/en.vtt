When I was 11,

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:06.966
I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.437
My father was listening to BBC News

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:13.611
on his small, gray radio.

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:16.487
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:20.458
because the news mostly depressed him.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:25.343
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:27.931
I didn't know what it meant,

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:33.117
but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
