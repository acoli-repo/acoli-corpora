00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.735
If you remember that first decade of the web,

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.990
it was really a static place.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.235
You could go online, you could look at pages,

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:09.748
and they were put up either by organizations

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:11.269
who had teams to do it

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.498
or by individuals who were really tech-savvy

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:15.235
for the time.

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:16.810
And with the rise of social media

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.209
and social networks in the early 2000s,

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:21.358
the web was completely changed

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:24.966
to a place where now the vast majority of content

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.278
we interact with is put up by average users,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.975
either in YouTube videos or blog posts
