The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one translation of which is, "The world is sound."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So you are, in fact, a chord --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
each of you an individual chord.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One definition of health may be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that that chord is in complete harmony.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Your ears can't hear that chord;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Incidentally, we see just one octave.
