00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:32.765
It's hard to explain, but you enter
a different mode when you head out there.

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.750
Your boat is your entire world,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.595
and what you take with you
when you leave is all you have.

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:40.612
If I said to you all now,
"Go off into Vancouver

00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:44.348
and find everything you will need for
your survival for the next three months,"

00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:46.116
that's quite a task.

00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:48.554
That's food, fuel, clothes,

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:50.969
even toilet roll and toothpaste.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.432
That's what we do,

00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:54.336
and when we leave we manage it

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:58.000
down to the last drop of diesel
and the last packet of food.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.833
No experience in my life

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.740
could have given me a better understanding
of the definition of the word "finite."
