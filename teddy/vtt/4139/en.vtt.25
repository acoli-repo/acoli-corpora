00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.598
For the first time on this new journey,
I could see exactly where we were headed.

00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:37.382
If we could build an economy that would
use things rather than use them up,

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.610

could work in the long term.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.514
I was excited.

00:12:42.514 --> 00:12:44.673
This was something to work towards.

00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:48.450
We knew exactly where we were headed.
We just had to work out how to get there,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.380
and it was exactly with this in mind

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.095
that we created the Ellen MacArthur

Many schools of thought fed our thinking
and pointed to this model:

00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:03.968
industrial symbiosis, performance economy,
sharing economy, biomimicry,
