00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:03.351
The speed I so desperately needed
brought with it danger.

00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:07.575
We all know what it's like driving a car
20 miles an hour, 30, 40.

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.454
It's not too stressful.
We can concentrate.

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.242
We can turn on the radio.

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:16.700
Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through
to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.974
Now you have white knuckles
and you're gripping the steering wheel.

00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:22.537
Now take that car off road at night

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:24.873
and remove the windscreen wipers,
the windscreen,

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:26.498
the headlights and the brakes.

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.704
That's what it's like
in the Southern Ocean.

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.192
(Laughter) (Applause)
