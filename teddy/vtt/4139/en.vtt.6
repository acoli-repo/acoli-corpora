00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.131
She was a multihull.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.892
When we built her, no one had ever
made it solo nonstop

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.191
around the world in one,
though many had tried,

00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.063
but whilst we built her, a Frenchman
took a boat 25 percent bigger than her

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:14.852
and not only did he make it,
but he took the record from 93 days

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:17.348
right down to 72.

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.155
The bar was now much, much higher.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:22.105
And these boats were exciting to sail.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:25.472
This was a training sail
off the French coast.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:29.187
This I know well because I was one
of the five crew members on board.

00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:33.538
Five seconds is all it took
from everything being fine
