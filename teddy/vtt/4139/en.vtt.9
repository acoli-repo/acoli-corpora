00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.584
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:35.370
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.296
which was far too much wind
for the boat and I to cope with.

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:41.337
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,

00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:43.427
and the spray from the breaking crests

00:04:43.427 --> 00:04:46.492
was blown horizontally
like snow in a blizzard.

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:50.370
If we didn't sail fast enough,
we'd be engulfed by that storm,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.527
and either capsized or smashed to pieces.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.314
We were quite literally
hanging on for our lives

00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:59.518
and doing so on a knife edge.

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:03.351
The speed I so desperately needed
brought with it danger.
