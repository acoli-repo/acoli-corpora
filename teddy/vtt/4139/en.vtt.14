There is no more.

00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:10.891
And never in my life had I ever
translated that definition of finite

00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:14.211
that I'd felt on board
to anything outside of sailing

00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.809
until I stepped off the boat at
the finish line having broken that record.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.955
(Applause)

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:26.935
Suddenly I connected the dots.

00:07:26.935 --> 00:07:29.164
Our global economy is no different.

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:32.276
It's entirely dependent
on finite materials
