00:11:57.353 --> 00:12:00.557
It's an economy that fundamentally
can't run in the long term,

00:12:00.557 --> 00:12:03.590
and if we know that we
have finite materials,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.919
why would we build an economy
that would effectively use things up,

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.777
that would create waste?

00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:11.702
Life itself has existed
for billions of years

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:15.324
and has continually adapted
to use materials effectively.

00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:18.645
It's a complex system,
but within it, there is no waste.

00:12:18.645 --> 00:12:20.874
Everything is metabolized.

00:12:21.244 --> 00:12:24.783
It's not a linear economy
at all, but circular.

00:12:25.934 --> 00:12:28.931
And I felt like the child in the garden.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.598
For the first time on this new journey,
I could see exactly where we were headed.
