00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:33.260
through something they have
absolutely no control over.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.390
And the more I learned, the more
I started to change my own life.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.849
I started traveling less,
doing less, using less.

00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:42.390
It felt like actually doing less
was what we had to do.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.740
But it sat uneasy with me.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.862
It didn't feel right.

00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:48.358
It felt like we were
buying ourselves time.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.250
We were eking things out a bit longer.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.477
Even if everybody changed,
it wouldn't solve the problem.

00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:55.521
It wouldn't fix the system.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:58.562
It was vital in the transition,
but what fascinated me was,

00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:02.951
in the transition to what?
What could actually work?
