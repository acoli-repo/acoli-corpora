00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:01.721
with this freezing Southern Ocean air
burning the back of my throat.

00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:04.276
But out there, those lowest of the lows

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:07.596
are so often contrasted
with the highest of the highs.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:11.659
A few days later, we came out
of the back of the low.

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.397
Against all odds, we'd been able
to drive ahead of the record

00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:17.464
within that depression.

00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:20.250
The sky cleared, the rain stopped,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.569
and our heartbeat, the monstrous
seas around us were transformed

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.168
into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.

00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:32.765
It's hard to explain, but you enter
a different mode when you head out there.
