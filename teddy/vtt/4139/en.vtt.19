00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:30.121
And it made me make a decision
I never thought I would make:

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.466
to leave the sport
of solo sailing behind me

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.531
and focus on the greatest challenge
I'd ever come across:

00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:37.861
the future of our global economy.

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.570
And I quickly realized it wasn't
just about energy.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.613
It was also materials.

00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:44.772
In 2008, I picked up a scientific study

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.816
looking at how many years we have

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:49.532
of valuable materials
to extract from the ground:

00:09:49.532 --> 00:09:53.921
copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.

00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:57.937
These figures couldn't be exact,
but we knew those materials were finite.

00:09:57.937 --> 00:09:59.674
We only have them once.

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:03.208
And yet, our speed that we've used
these materials has increased rapidly,
