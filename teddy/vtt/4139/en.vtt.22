00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:02.951
in the transition to what?
What could actually work?

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:07.246
It struck me that the system itself,
the framework within which we live,

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:09.545
is fundamentally flawed,

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:12.804
and I realized ultimately

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:15.837
that our operating system,
the way our economy functions,

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:19.320
the way our economy's been built,
is a system in itself.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.222
At sea, I had to understand
complex systems.

00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:24.100
I had to take multiple inputs,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.612
I had to process them,

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:28.500
and I had to understand the system to win.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.233
I had to make sense of it.
