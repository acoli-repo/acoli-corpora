It's entirely dependent
on finite materials

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.864
we only have once
in the history of humanity.

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:38.638
And it was a bit like seeing something
you weren't expecting under a stone

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:40.147
and having two choices:

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.701
I either put that stone to one side

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:46.114
and learn more about it,
or I put that stone back

00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:49.876
and I carry on with my dream job
of sailing around the world.

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.128
I chose the first.

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:55.611
I put it to one side and I began
a new journey of learning,

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:59.117
speaking to chief executives,
experts, scientists, economists

00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:02.739
to try to understand just how
our global economy works.
