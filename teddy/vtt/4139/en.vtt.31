00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:31.255
Is it actually possible?

00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:32.765
I believe yes.

00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:36.944
When you look at the lifetime of
my great-grandfather, anything's possible.

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:41.310
When he was born, there were only
25 cars in the world;

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.740
they had only just been invented.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.671
When he was 14, we flew
for the first time in history.

00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:50.160
Now there are 100,000 charter flights

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.106
every single day.

00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:56.100
When he was 45, we built
the first computer.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.257
Many said it wouldn't catch on,
but it did, and just 20 years later

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:01.278
we turned it into a microchip
