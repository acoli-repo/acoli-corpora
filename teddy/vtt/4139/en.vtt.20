00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:03.208
And yet, our speed that we've used
these materials has increased rapidly,

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:04.950
exponentially.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.806
With more people in the world
with more stuff,

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:10.580
we've effectively seen
100 years of price declines

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.425
in those basic commodities
erased in just 10 years.

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.212
And this affects all of us.

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.232
It's brought huge volatility in prices,

00:10:17.232 --> 00:10:20.081
so much so that in 2011,

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:22.619
your average European car manufacturer

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:25.173
saw a raw material price increase

00:10:25.173 --> 00:10:27.379
of 500 million Euros,

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:29.701
wiping away half their operating profits

00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:33.260
through something they have
absolutely no control over.
