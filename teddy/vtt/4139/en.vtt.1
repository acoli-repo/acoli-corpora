00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.488
But the most amazing feeling
was the feeling of freedom,

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:35.226
the feeling that I felt
when we hoisted her sails.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.600
As a four-year-old child,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.449
it was the greatest sense of freedom
that I could ever imagine.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.792
I made my mind up there and then
that one day, somehow,

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.850
I was going to sail around the world.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.360
So I did what I could in my life
to get closer to that dream.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.426
Age 10, it was saving my school
dinner money change.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:59.344
Every single day for eight years,
I had mashed potato and baked beans,

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:01.997
which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.
