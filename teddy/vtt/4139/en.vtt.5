00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.750
I'd loved it, so much so
that within six months

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.326
I decided to go around the world again,
but this time not in a race:

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:40.214
to try to be the fastest person ever
to sail solo nonstop around the world.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.650
Now for this, I needed a different craft:

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.244
bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:50.959
Just to give that boat some scale,
I could climb inside her mast

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.863
all the way to the top.

00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:55.973
Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:58.372
I affectionately called her Moby.

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.131
She was a multihull.
