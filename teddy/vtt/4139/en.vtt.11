00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.192
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.041
You could imagine

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:36.831
it would be quite difficult
to sleep in that situation,

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:38.511
even as a passenger.

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:40.306
But you're not a passenger.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.705
You're alone on a boat
you can barely stand up in,

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.213
and you have to make
every single decision on board.

00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:48.487
I was absolutely exhausted,
physically and mentally.

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:50.600
Eight sail changes in 12 hours.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.130
The mainsail weighed
three times my body weight,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.827
and after each change,

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:57.124
I would collapse on the floor
soaked with sweat

00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:01.721
with this freezing Southern Ocean air
burning the back of my throat.
