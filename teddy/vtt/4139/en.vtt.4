00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:01.299
From that first meeting
to the finish line of the race,

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.597
it was everything I'd ever imagined.

00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:07.498
Just like in my dreams, there were
amazing parts and tough parts.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.658
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:12.931
Nine times, I climbed to the top
of her 90-foot mast.

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.300
We were blown on our side
in the Southern Ocean.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.272
But the sunsets, the wildlife,
and the remoteness

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.597
were absolutely breathtaking.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.504
After three months at sea, age just 24,

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:26.799
I finished in second position.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.750
I'd loved it, so much so
that within six months
