00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.531
I was approaching a part in the ocean

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:05.432
which was 2,000 miles away
from the nearest town.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.311
The nearest land was Antarctica,
and the nearest people

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.180
would be those manning
the European Space Station above me.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.560
(Laughter)

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.369
You really are in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.180
If you need help,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.736
and you're still alive,

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:21.731
it takes four days
for a ship to get to you

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.145
and then four days for that ship
to get you back to port.

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:27.466
No helicopter can reach you out there,

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.310
and no plane can land.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.584
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.
