which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:05.014
Every day I would pile up the change
on the top of my money box,

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.604
and when that pile reached a pound,
I would drop it in

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:12.167
and cross off one of the 100 squares
I'd drawn on a piece of paper.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:15.418
Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:19.381
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden
dreaming of my goal.

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:22.500
I read every book I could on sailing,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.495
and then eventually,
having been told by my school

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.771
I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.454
left school age 17 to begin
my apprenticeship in sailing.
