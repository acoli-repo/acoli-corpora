00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.842
I went to the World
Coal Association website,

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:03.164
and there in the middle
of the homepage, it said,

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:06.322
"We have about 118 years of coal left."

00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:09.456
And I thought to myself, well,
that's well outside my lifetime,

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:12.335
and a much greater figure
than the predictions for oil.

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:15.400
But I did the math, and I realized
that my great-grandfather

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.974
had been born exactly 118 years
before that year,

00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:22.737
and I sat on his knee
until I was 11 years old,

00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:24.641
and I realized it's nothing

00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:26.963
in time, nor in history.

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:30.121
And it made me make a decision
I never thought I would make:
