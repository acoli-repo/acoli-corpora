WEBVTT

00:09:56.585 --> 00:10:00.584
but it started six years ago
with passionate community members

00:10:00.608 --> 00:10:03.108
gathered around an elder's kitchen table.

00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:07.528
Since then, we have created
weekend learning experiences

00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:09.299
aimed at multigenerational learning,

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:12.260
where we focus on passing
language and culture on to children.

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:16.116
We use traditional games,
songs, foods and activities to do that.

00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:17.791
We have classes

00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:20.022
at both the beginner
and intermediate levels

00:10:20.046 --> 00:10:21.312
offered right here.

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:23.934
We've partnered with
school boards and libraries

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.878
to have resources and language
in place in formal education.

00:10:28.807 --> 00:10:30.482
The possibilities are just endless,
