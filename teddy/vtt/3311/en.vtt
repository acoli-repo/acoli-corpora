Dene Elder Paul Disain said,

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:04.578
"Our language and culture

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.999
is the window through which
we see the world."

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:08.174
And on Turtle Island,

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:10.433
what is now known as North America,

00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:14.220
there're so many unique
and wonderful ways to see the world.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:16.172
As a person of Indigenous heritage,

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.283
I'm interested in learning
Anishinaabemowin,

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:19.768
which is my heritage language,

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.387
because it lets me see the world
through that window.

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.037
It lets me connect with my family,

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:25.942
my ancestors, my community, my culture.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.958
And lets me think
about how I can pass that on

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:30.449
to future generations.
