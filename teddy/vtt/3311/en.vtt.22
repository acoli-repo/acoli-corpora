WEBVTT

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:00.643
is incorporated meaningfully
into education,

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.731
both on and off reserve.

00:11:02.755 --> 00:11:05.771
On reserve, education is funded
at significantly lower levels

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.334
than it is off reserve.

00:11:07.358 --> 00:11:08.680
And off reserve,

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:11.168
Indigenous language education
is often neglected,

00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:12.704
because people assume

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:15.625
that Indigenous people
are not present in provincial schools,

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:18.933
when actually, around 70 percent
of Indigenous people in Canada today

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:20.129
live off reserve.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:24.329
Those children have equal right
to access their language and culture.

00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:27.884
Beyond policy, we need support.

00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:30.869
And that doesn't just mean
financial support.
