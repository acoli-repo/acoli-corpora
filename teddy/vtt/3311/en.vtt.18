00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:01.243
you'll see a little "r"
right next to that language right there.

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:02.958
That language is Mi'kmaq.

00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:05.776
Mi'kmaq has undergone
significant revitalization

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.363
because of the adoption
of a self-government agreement

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:10.752
that led to culture
and language-based education,

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:12.680
and now there are Mi'kmaq children

00:09:12.704 --> 00:09:15.149
who have Mi'kmaq as their first language.

00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:17.029
There's so much that we can do.

00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:18.502
These children are students

00:09:18.526 --> 00:09:21.490
in the Mnidoo Mnising
Anishinabek Kinoomaage,

00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:23.578
an immersion school on Manitoulin island,

00:09:23.602 --> 00:09:25.996
where they learn in Anishinaabemowin.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.125
They arrived at school
in junior kindergarten

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:30.871
speaking very little,
if any, Anishinaabemowin.
