00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:30.869
And that doesn't just mean
financial support.

00:11:30.893 --> 00:11:33.948
We need space where we can
carry out activities,

00:11:33.972 --> 00:11:39.130
classes and interaction
with nonindigenous populations as well.

00:11:39.623 --> 00:11:41.116
We need support

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.853
that looks like people
wanting to learn the language.

00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:47.404
We need support where people talk
about why these languages are important.

00:11:48.004 --> 00:11:50.180
And to achieve that, we need education.

00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:53.418
We need access to immersion
education primarily,

00:11:53.442 --> 00:11:56.410
as that is most certainly
the most effective way

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.856
to ensure the transmission
of Indigenous languages.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.598
But we also need education
in provincial schools,
