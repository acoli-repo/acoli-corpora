Rocks are marked as animate,

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.705
and that tells us really interesting
things about grammar,

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.903
and it also tells us
really interesting things

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:07.680
about how Anishinaabemowin speakers

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.417
relate to and understand
the world around them.

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.429
Now, the sad part of that

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:15.601
is that Indigenous languages
are in danger.

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:19.600
Indigenous languages that posses
so much knowledge of culture,

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:20.776
of history,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.784
of ways to relate to one another,

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:24.894
of ways to relate to our environment.

00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:27.116
Having been on this land
since time immemorial,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.117
these languages have developed here

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.815
and they contain priceless
environmental knowledge
