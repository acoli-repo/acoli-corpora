00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.498
Here's the situation that we're in.

00:08:31.522 --> 00:08:35.252
Of the 60 currently spoken
Indigenous languages in Canada,

00:08:35.276 --> 00:08:39.509
all but six are considered endangered
by the United Nations.

00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:44.834
So, the six that aren't are Cree,
Anishinaabemowin,

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.969
Stoney, Mi'kmaq,

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:49.824
Dene and Inuktitut.

00:08:50.374 --> 00:08:52.198
And that sounds really dire.

00:08:52.222 --> 00:08:55.413
But if you go on to the Atlas
of the World's Languages in Danger

00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:57.977
through the UNESCO website,

00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:01.243
you'll see a little "r"
right next to that language right there.
