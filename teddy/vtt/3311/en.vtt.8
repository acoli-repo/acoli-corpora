Duncan Campbell Scott

for Indigenous children in 1920, he said,

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.482
"I want to get rid of the Indian problem.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.137
Our objective is to continue

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.686
until there is not
a single Indian in Canada

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.491
that has not been absorbed
into the body politic

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.840
and there is no Indian question,
and no Indian Department;

00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:29.526
that is the whole object of this Bill."
