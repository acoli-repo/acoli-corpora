And now, in grade three and grade four,

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:36.910
they're testing at intermediate
and fluent levels.

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:38.252
At the same time,

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:41.299
they have beautifully high self-esteem.

00:09:41.323 --> 00:09:43.458
They are proud to be Anishinaabe people,

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.805
and they have strong learning skills.

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:50.498

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:51.672
In our local community,

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:54.213
we have the Kingston
Indigenous Language Nest.

00:09:54.712 --> 00:09:56.561

but it started six years ago
with passionate community members
