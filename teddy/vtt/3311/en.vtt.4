00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:01.593
one that was "goluboy,"
which is light blue,

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:03.369
one that is "siniy," dark blue.

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:05.282
And those are seen as different colors.

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:07.330
If you were speakers of Anishinaabemowin,

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.731
you would have seen slides
that were Ozhaawashkwaa

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.636
or Ozhaawashkozi,
which means either green or blue.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.255
It's not that speakers
don't see the colors,

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:20.125
it's that the way they categorize them
and the way that they understand shades

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:21.307
is different.

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.497
At the same time,

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:26.117
there are universals in the ways
that humans categorize color,

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:28.073
and that tells us about how human brains

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:31.030
understand and express
what they're seeing.
