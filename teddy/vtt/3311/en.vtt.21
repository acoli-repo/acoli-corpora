00:10:28.807 --> 00:10:30.482
The possibilities are just endless,

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:33.363
and I'm so grateful
for the work that has been done

00:10:33.387 --> 00:10:36.361
to allow me to pass language
and culture on to my son

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.577
and to other children
within our community.

00:10:39.045 --> 00:10:42.319
We've developed a strong,
beautiful, vibrant community as well,

00:10:42.343 --> 00:10:44.474
as a result of this shared effort.

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:48.656
So what do we need moving forward?

00:10:49.173 --> 00:10:51.331
First of all, we need policy.

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.371
We need enacted policy
with attached funding

00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:57.755
that will ensure that Indigenous language

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:00.643
is incorporated meaningfully
into education,
