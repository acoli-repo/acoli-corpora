But we also need education
in provincial schools,

00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:04.062
we need education
for the nonindigenous populations

00:12:04.086 --> 00:12:06.554
so that we can come to a better
mutual understanding

00:12:06.578 --> 00:12:08.751
and move forward in a better way together.

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:13.971
I have this quote hanging
in a framed picture on my office wall.

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:17.437
It was a gift from a settler ally student
that I taught a few years ago,

00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:18.779
and it reminds me every day

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:22.434
that we can achieve great things
if we work together.

00:12:23.002 --> 00:12:25.280
But if we're going to talk
about reconciliation,

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:26.510
we need to acknowledge

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:29.558
that a reconciliation that does not result

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:33.307
in the survivance and continuation
of Indigenous languages and cultures
