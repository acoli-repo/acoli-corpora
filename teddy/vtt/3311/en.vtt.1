00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:30.449
to future generations.

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:32.054
As a linguist,

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:35.213
I'm interested in how language
functions generally.

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:37.142
I can look at phonetics and phonology --

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.355
speech sounds.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.141
I can look at morphology,
or the structure of words.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:42.333
I can look at syntax,

00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:44.816
which is the structure
of sentences and phrases,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.308
to learn about how humans
store language in our brains

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:51.047
and how we use it to communicate
with one another.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.093
For example,

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:57.132
Anishinaabemowin,
like most Indigenous languages,

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.005
is what's called polysynthetic,

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.206
which means that there are
very, very long words,
