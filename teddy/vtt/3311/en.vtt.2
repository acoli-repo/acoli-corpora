00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.206
which means that there are
very, very long words,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.234
composed of little tiny pieces
called morphemes.

00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:09.651
So I can say, in Anishinaabemowin,
"niwiisin," "I eat,"

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:10.903
which is one word.

00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:14.710
I can say "nimino-wiisin," "I eat well,"

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:15.918
which is still one word.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:21.152
I can say "nimino-naawakwe-wiisin,"
"I eat a good lunch,"

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:23.510
which is how many words in English?

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.671
Five words in English,
a single word in Anishinaabemowin.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.662
Now, I've got a bit of a quiz for you.
