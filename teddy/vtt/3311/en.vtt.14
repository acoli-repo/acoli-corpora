00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:02.445
The TRC also gifted us
with 94 calls to action,

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.874
beacons that can lead the way forward
as we work to reconciliation.

00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:10.707
Several of those pertain directly
to language and culture.

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:14.525
The TRC calls us to ensure
adequate, funded education,

00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:16.426
including language and culture.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.561
To acknowledge Indigenous rights,
including language rights.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.601
To create an Aboriginal Languages Act

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.625
aimed at acknowledging and preserving
Indigenous languages,

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:26.577
with attached funding.

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.783
To create a position
for an Aboriginal Languages Commissioner

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.879
and to develop postsecondary
language programs
