00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.815
and they contain priceless
environmental knowledge

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.064
that helps us relate well
to the land on which we live.

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:39.751
But they are, in fact, in danger.

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:42.831
The vast majority of Indigenous
languages in North America

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.387
are considered endangered,

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.339
and those that are not
endangered are vulnerable.

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:49.402
That is by design.

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:52.984
In our laws, in our policies,

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:55.291
in our houses of governance,

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:58.117
there have been stated attempts

00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.711
to eliminate Indigenous languages
and cultures in this country.
