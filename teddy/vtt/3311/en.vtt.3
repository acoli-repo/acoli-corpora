00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.662
Now, I've got a bit of a quiz for you.

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:33.717
In a one-word answer,
what color is that slide?

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:35.321
Audience: Green.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.305
Lindsay Morcom: What color is that slide?

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.493
Audience: Green.

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:39.942
LM: What color is that slide?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.172
Audience: Blue.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:42.895
LM: And what color is that slide?

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.117
(Audience murmurs)

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.557
Not trick questions, I promise.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.589
For you as English speakers,

00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:50.812
you saw two green slides
and two blue slides.

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:54.479
But the way that we categorize colors
varies across languages,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:56.265
so if you had been Russian speakers,

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.504
you would have seen two slides
that were different shades of green,

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:01.593
one that was "goluboy,"
which is light blue,
