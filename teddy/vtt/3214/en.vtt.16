00:07:57.922 --> 00:08:01.199
So confessing may seem like
the best option to most teens,

00:08:01.223 --> 00:08:05.403
who are less focused on that long-term
risk of conviction and punishment

00:08:05.427 --> 00:08:06.583
down the road

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:08.276
as a result of that confession.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.838
I think we can all agree
that thoughtful, long-term planning

00:08:11.862 --> 00:08:14.651
is not a strength of most
teenagers that we know.

00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:17.975
And by and large,
the legal system seems to get

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.646
that young victims and witnesses
should be treated differently than adults.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.725
But when it comes to young suspects,
it's like the kid gloves come off.

00:08:26.487 --> 00:08:29.576
And treating juveniles as though
they're adults in interrogations

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.758
is a problem,
