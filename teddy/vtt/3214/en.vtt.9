We know that youth are especially
vulnerable to providing false confessions.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.328
In one study of exonerations, for example,

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.746
only eight percent of adults
had falsely confessed,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.098
but 42 percent of juveniles had done so.

00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:46.193
Of course, if we're just looking
at wrongful convictions and exonerations,

00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:48.152
we're only getting part of the story.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:53.188
Left out, for instance, are the many cases
that are resolved by guilty pleas,

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:54.362
not trials.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.685
From TV and news headlines,

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:59.805
you may think that trials are the norm
in our legal system,

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:03.415
but the reality is that 97 percent
of legal cases in the US
