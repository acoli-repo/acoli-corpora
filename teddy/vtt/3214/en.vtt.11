00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:31.532
In our research, we found alarming rates
of false confession among teenagers.

00:05:31.942 --> 00:05:36.019
We interviewed almost 200
incarcerated 14-to-17-year-olds,

00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:37.819
and 17 percent of them reported

00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:40.674
that they'd made at least
one false confession to police.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.784
What's also shocking to most is that,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.121
in interrogations in the US,

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:50.468
police are allowed to interrogate
juveniles just like adults.

00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:52.040
So they can lie to them --

00:05:52.607 --> 00:05:56.472
blatant lies like, "We have
your fingerprints,

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:57.665
we have your DNA;

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.654
your friend is down the hall
saying that this was all your idea."
