00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.260
in approximately 25 percent
of wrongful convictions

00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:03.297
of people later exonerated
by DNA evidence.

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.017
Turns out, they were innocent.

00:04:05.634 --> 00:04:08.827
These cases are crystal clear
because we have the DNA.

00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:10.901
So they didn't do the crime,

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.106
and yet one-quarter of them
confessed to it anyway.

00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:18.030
And at this point,
from countless research studies,

00:04:18.054 --> 00:04:21.380
we have a pretty good sense
of why people falsely confess,

00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:22.858
and why some people,

00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:24.483
like Brendan Dassey,

00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:26.892
are at greater risk for doing so.

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:33.106
We know that youth are especially
vulnerable to providing false confessions.
