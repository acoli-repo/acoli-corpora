00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:03.415
but the reality is that 97 percent
of legal cases in the US

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.044
are resolved by pleas, not trials.

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.021
Ninety-seven percent.

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.678
Also left out will be confessions
to more minor types of crimes

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:14.926
that don't typically involve DNA evidence

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.272
and aren't usually reviewed
or appealed following a conviction.

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:20.276
So for this reason,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.506
many refer to the false confessions
we actually do know about

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.045
as the tip of a much larger iceberg.

00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:31.532
In our research, we found alarming rates
of false confession among teenagers.
