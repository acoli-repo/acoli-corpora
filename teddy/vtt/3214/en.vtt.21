In our research, only seven percent
of incarcerated teens,

00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:33.166
most of whom had had numerous
encounters with police,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.187
had ever had a parent or attorney
in the room with them

00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:38.300
when they were questioned as a suspect.

00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:42.285
Few had ever asked for a parent
or attorney to be present.

00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:45.946
And you see this

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.108
We did a mock interrogation
experiment in our lab here at FIU --

00:10:50.132 --> 00:10:52.476
with parent permission
for all minors, of course,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.055
and all the appropriate ethical approvals.

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:59.673
We falsely accused teens and adults
of cheating on a study task --

00:10:59.697 --> 00:11:01.332
an academic dishonesty offense --
