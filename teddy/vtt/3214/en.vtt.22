an academic dishonesty offense --

00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:04.477
that we told them was as serious
as cheating in a class.

00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:07.907
In reality, participants
had witnessed a peer cheat,

00:11:07.931 --> 00:11:10.345

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.621
and was allegedly on academic probation.

00:11:13.136 --> 00:11:15.314
And we gave everyone a tough choice:

who will probably be expelled
because of his academic probation status.

00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:27.078
Of course, in reality, none of these

and we fully debriefed
all of the participants afterward.

00:11:29.858 --> 00:11:33.874
But most teenagers --
59 percent of them --
