More than 70 percent
of the teens in our study said

00:07:00.143 --> 00:07:02.298
that the police had tried
to "befriend" them

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:06.175
or indicate a desire to help them out
during the interrogation.

00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:09.655
These are referred to
as "minimization strategies,"

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.725
and they're designed to convey
sympathy and understanding to the suspect,

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.839
and they imply that a confession
will result in more lenient treatment.

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:21.899
So in the classic
good-cop-bad-cop oversimplification

00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:23.272
of police interrogations,

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.622
this is "good cop."

00:07:24.646 --> 00:07:28.323
(Video) P1: Honesty here, Brendan,
is the thing that's going to help you, OK?

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.529
No matter what you did,

00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:31.971
we can work through that, OK?
