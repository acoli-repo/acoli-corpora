00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.758
is a problem,

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:32.039
because literally hundreds

00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:34.123
of psychological
and neuroscientific studies

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:36.767
tell us that juveniles
do not think like adults,

00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:38.637
they do not behave like adults,

00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.926
and they're not built like adults.

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:44.577
Adolescent brains are different
from adult brains --

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:45.928
even anatomically.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.575
So there are important changes happening

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:52.201
in the structure and function
of the brain during adolescence,

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:55.237
especially in the prefrontal cortex
and the limbic system,

00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:59.631
and these are areas that are crucial
for things like self-control,

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:01.005
decision-making,
