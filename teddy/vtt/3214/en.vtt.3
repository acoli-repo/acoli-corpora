P1: That's what she said,
because she thinks you know more, too.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.148
P2: We're in your corner.

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:38.938
P1: We already know what happened,
now tell us exactly. Don't lie.

00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:43.093
Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan
that honesty would "set him free,"

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:46.024
but they were completely
convinced of his guilt at that point.

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:48.413
So by honesty, they meant a confession,

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:51.982
and his confession would definitely not
end up setting him free.

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:54.747
They eventually got
a confession from Brendan

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.352
that didn't really make sense,

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:58.970
didn't match much of the physical
evidence of the crime

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.415
and is widely believed to be false.
