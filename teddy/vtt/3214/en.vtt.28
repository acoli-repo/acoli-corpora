00:13:59.747 --> 00:14:02.927
Now, no one -- and certainly not
me -- wants to prevent police

00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:05.212
from doing the very important
investigative work

00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:07.143
that they do every day.

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:11.478
But we need to make sure that they have
appropriate training for talking to youth.

00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:13.707
As a parent and as a researcher,

00:14:13.731 --> 00:14:15.293
I think we can do better.

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:19.713
I think we can take steps to prevent
another Brendan Dassey,

00:14:19.737 --> 00:14:22.982
while still getting the crucial
information that we need

00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:24.162
from children and teens

00:14:24.186 --> 00:14:25.459
to solve crimes.

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.096
Thank you.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.148
