00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:01.451
and to be honest with you,
I've seen worse.

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:05.399
So I understand the public
outcry about injustice

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:08.034
in Brendan Dassey's individual case.

00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:12.593
But let's not forget that approximately
one million or so of his peers

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:14.920
are arrested every year
in the United States

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.411
and may be subjected to similar
interrogation techniques,

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:22.143
techniques that we know increase
the risk for false confession.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.108
And I know many people are going
to struggle with that term,

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:27.315
"false confession,"

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:31.060
and with believing that false
confessions actually occur.
