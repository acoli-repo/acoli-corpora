00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.191
and if you haven't,
you should definitely watch it.

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:34.446
The Dassey case is also unique

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.380
because it led to such
intense public outrage.

00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:40.409
People were very angry about
how Brendan was questioned,

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:44.448
and many assumed that his interrogation
had to have been illegal.

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:46.500
It wasn't illegal.

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:48.622
As someone who's a researcher in this area

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:51.487
and is familiar with police
interrogation training manuals,

00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:53.748
I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.669
The fact is, Dassey's interrogation itself
is actually not all that unique,

00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:01.451
and to be honest with you,
I've seen worse.
