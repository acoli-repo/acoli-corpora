and with believing that false
confessions actually occur.

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:32.253
And I get that.

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:35.812
It's very shocking and counterintuitive:

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:40.765
Why would someone confess
and even give gruesome details

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.065
about a horrifying crime
like rape or murder

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.980
if they hadn't actually done it?

00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:47.488
It makes no sense.

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:50.516
And the fact is, we can never
know precisely

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.464
how often false confessions occur.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.925
But what we do know is that false
confessions or admissions were present

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.260
in approximately 25 percent
of wrongful convictions
