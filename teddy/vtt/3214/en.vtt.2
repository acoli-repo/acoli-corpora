00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:03.080
So here's just a brief snippet
of his four-hour interrogation.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.924
(Video) Police 1: Brendan, be honest.

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.284
I told you before that's the only thing
that's going to help you here.

00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:10.058
We already know what happened, OK?

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:12.152
Police 2: If we don't get honesty here --

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.402
I'm your friend right now,

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.689
but I've got to believe in you,

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:19.184
and if I don't believe in you,

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:20.784
I can't go to bat for you.

00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:23.050
OK? You're nodding.

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:24.293
Tell us what happened.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.663
P1: Your mom said you'd be honest with us.

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.770
P2: And she's behind you 100 percent
no matter what happens here.

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:32.806
P1: That's what she said,
because she thinks you know more, too.
