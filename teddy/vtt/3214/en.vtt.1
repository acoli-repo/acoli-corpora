00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.774
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist,

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.804
and I study these types of cases.

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:36.253
As a researcher,

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:37.448
a professor

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:38.781
and a new parent,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.702
my goal is to conduct scientific research
that helps us understand

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.954
how kids function in a legal system
that was designed for adults.

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:49.246
In March of 2006,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.563
police interrogated Brendan Dassey,

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:55.507
a 16-year-old high school student
with an IQ around 70,

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.476
putting him in the range
of intellectual disability.

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:03.080
So here's just a brief snippet
of his four-hour interrogation.
