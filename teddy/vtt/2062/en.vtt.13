00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that talking is not agreeing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
as we should,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that they must respect minority rights,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
if we don't accept majority rights?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Because they may turn out to be a majority.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
How can we escape [having] a double-standard,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
if we at the same time preach democracy

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and at the same time

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
don't want to deal with the groups that are representative?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
How will we ever be interlocutors?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now my diplomats are instructed

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to talk to all these groups.
