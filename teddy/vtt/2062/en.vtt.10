00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But if you don't talk,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you can't engage the other side.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the other side which you're going to engage

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
"You don't make peace with your friends,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you make peace with your enemies."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It's hard, but it is necessary.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Let me go one step further.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This is Tahrir Square.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
There's a revolution going on.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The Arab Spring is heading into fall

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and is moving into winter.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It will last for a long, long time.
