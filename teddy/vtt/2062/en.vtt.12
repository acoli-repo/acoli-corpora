00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the dictate of the authoritarian leaders

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
to stay away from these different groups,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because they were terrorists.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So now that they are emerging in the street

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and we salute the democratic revolution,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we find out how little we know.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Right now, the discussion goes,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Should we talk to Hamas?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I think that is wrong.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that talking is not agreeing.
