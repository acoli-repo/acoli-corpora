00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we think of financial and economic primarily --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the ones that concern me most

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the deficit of political dialogue --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
our ability to address modern conflicts

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as they are,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to go to the source of what they're all about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and to understand the key players

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and to deal with them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We who are diplomats,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I can tell you, our agenda is full.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There is trade, there is disarmament,
