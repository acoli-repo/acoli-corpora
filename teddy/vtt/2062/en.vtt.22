00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
by engaging with civil society.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
All of a sudden,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but they were taking [them] into the negotiations,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And they brought their knowledge.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And there was an interaction

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is perhaps a first element

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of a change.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
In the future, I believe,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
we should draw examples from these different illustrations,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
not to have diplomacy

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
which is disconnected from people and civil society.
