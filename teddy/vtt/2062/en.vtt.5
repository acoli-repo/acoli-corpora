00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And who would talk to terrorists?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The West, as I would see it,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
comes out of that decade weakened,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
because we didn't understand the group.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So we've spent more time

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
on focusing on why we should not talk to others

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
than finding out how we talk to others.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now I'm not naive.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And there are times you should walk.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And sometimes military intervention is necessary.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.
