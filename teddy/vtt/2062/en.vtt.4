00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They need political solutions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we, therefore, have a problem,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because they escape traditional diplomacy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And we have among states

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a reluctance in dealing with them.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Plus, during the last decade,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we've been in the mode

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
where dealing with groups

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
was conceptually and politically dangerous.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
After 9/11,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
either you were with us or against us.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It was black or white.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And groups are very often

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
immediately label terrorists.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And who would talk to terrorists?
