00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
not to have diplomacy

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
which is disconnected from people and civil society.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And we have to go also

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
beyond traditional diplomacy

as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
but when we move toward something
