00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
by also these broader forces of societies

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that we now very loosely call groups?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The good thing is that we are not powerless.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We have never had

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
means of including.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The diplomatic toolbox

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is actually full of different tools we can use

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
to strengthen our communication.
