00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let me show you a slide here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which illustrates the character of conflicts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
since 1946 until today.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You see the green

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is a traditional interstate conflict,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the ones we used to read about.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The red is modern conflict,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
conflicts within states.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These are quite different,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and they are outside the grasp

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of modern diplomacy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And the core of these key actors

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
are groups

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
who represent different interests
