00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
inside the Palestinian population,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
between the peoples of Palestine and Israel.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And as we try to understand this broad movement

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
across the Arab world,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
we are not powerless.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
We need to improve the necessary skills,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and we need the courage to use them.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
In my country,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I have seen how the council of Islamist groups

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and Christian groups

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
came together, not as a government initiative,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
but they came together on their own initiative

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to establish contact and dialogue

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in times where things were pretty low-key tension.
