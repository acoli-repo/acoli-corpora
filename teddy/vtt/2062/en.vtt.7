00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I met the commander of ISAF,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the international troops.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We just have to persevere."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Now four COM ISAF's later,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
we hear a different message:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
"This cannot be won militarily.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We need military presence,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but we need to move to politics.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We can only solve this through a political solution.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And it is not us who will solve it;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Afghans have to solve it."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But then they need a different political process
