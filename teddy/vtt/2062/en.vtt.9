00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We didn't grasp what was going on.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is talking to everyone,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and it is doing so because it is neutral.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And that's one reason why

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that organization probably

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is the best informed key player

My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And you don't have to agree

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when you sit down with the other side.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you can always walk.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But if you don't talk,
