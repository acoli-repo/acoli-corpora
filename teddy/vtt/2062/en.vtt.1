There is trade, there is disarmament,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
there is cross-border relations.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But the picture is changing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we are seeing that there are new key players

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
coming onto the scene.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We loosely call them "groups."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They may represent social, religious,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
political, economic, military realities.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And we struggle with how to deal with them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The rules of engagement:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
how to talk, when to talk,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and how to deal with them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let me show you a slide here
