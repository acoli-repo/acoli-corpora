00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The alternative is a strategy

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of engagement and principled dialogue.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in modern diplomacy,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
not only between states,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but also within states.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We are seeing some new signs.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We could never have done

the convention against anti-personnel landmines

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and the convention that is banning cluster munitions

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
unless we had done diplomacy differently,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
by engaging with civil society.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
All of a sudden,
