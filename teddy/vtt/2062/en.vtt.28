00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in times where things were pretty low-key tension.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And when tension increased,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
they already had that dialogue,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and that was a strength to deal with different issues.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Our modern Western societies

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
are more complex than before,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in this time of migration.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We"

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to deal with our issues

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
if we don't improve our skills of communication?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So there are many reasons,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and for all of these reasons,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
this is time and this is why we must talk.
