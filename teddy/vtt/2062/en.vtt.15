00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
we will further radicalization,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I believe.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We will make the road from violent activities into politics

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
harder to travel.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that if you move towards democracy,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
if you move towards taking part

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in civilized and normal standards among states,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there are some rewards on the other side.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The paradox here

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is that the last decade probably was a lost decade

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
for making progress on this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising --
