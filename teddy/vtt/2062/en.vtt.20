00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
my opinions and my values.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I cannot do that

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
unless I send the signals that I will be open

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to listen to the other side's signals.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We need a lot more training on how to do that

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and a lot more practice

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
on how that can take problem-solving forward.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We know from our personal experiences

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that it's easy sometimes

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
just to walk,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and sometimes you may need to fight.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Sometimes you have to.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.
