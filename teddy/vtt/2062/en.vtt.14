00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now my diplomats are instructed

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to talk to all these groups.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But talking can be done in different ways.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and talking at the political level.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There's a big array

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of the ways of dealing with this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So if we refuse

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to talk to these new groups

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that are going to be dominating the news in years to come,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
we will further radicalization,
