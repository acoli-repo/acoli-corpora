00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
are groups

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
who represent different interests

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
inside countries.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So in a way, it is everybody's business.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
recent years,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is that very few

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
can be solved militarily.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They may have to be dealt with with military means,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but they cannot be solved by military means.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They need political solutions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we, therefore, have a problem,
