00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and actually all the way down into the sewer

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because I want to talk about diarrhea.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in particular, I want to talk about

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the design of diarrhea.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
they really mean design by natural selection.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And that brings me to the title of the talk,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.
