Thank you.

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:44.487
SRK: I think as an idea, genuinely,
it’s a great thought.

00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:49.487

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:55.223
MP: For me, science
is not bookish knowledge.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:58.303

00:06:58.327 --> 00:07:02.623
There is a child in all your hearts and,
that child is very curious.
