00:01:57.247 --> 00:02:02.143
There I saw a blood testing machine
that cost 60,000 rupees,

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.223
that ran on electricity,

00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:06.263
lying by the door.

00:02:06.287 --> 00:02:08.703
That village had never seen electricity.

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:12.247
That’s when I recalled
these rotating toys.

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:17.543
I started thinking about this
ordinary looking toy,

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.902
it’s probably the oldest toy in the world.

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:25.663
Yet until now, nobody has
ever asked how it works.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:29.143
So we started doing research on this

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:34.367
and after months of hard work
we came up with a simple formula.
