The cost of making this
instrument is 100 rupees,

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:09.287
but it challenges microscopes
that cost hundred times hundred to make.

00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:19.223
In 2014, Jim and I decided to
share these microscopes with people.

00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:22.745
We sent fifty thousand such microscopes

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:25.158
to children in 130 countries
across the world.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:29.263
This led to a Citizen Scientist Network.
