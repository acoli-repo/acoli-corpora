00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:34.367
and after months of hard work
we came up with a simple formula.

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:38.433
This formula tells us

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.263
how by changing its dimensions

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:47.423
you can convert this toy into a
20-rupee mobile centrifuge.

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.783
It’s called a "Paperfuge,"

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:53.053
and with this centrifuge we can
separate the parasites from the blood

00:02:53.053 --> 00:02:58.383
in malaria, TB and for many such diseases,
to detect the illness.

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:05.143
Now, in this small toy
I will place a drop of my blood.
