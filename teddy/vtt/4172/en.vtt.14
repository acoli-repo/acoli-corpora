00:06:58.327 --> 00:07:02.623
There is a child in all your hearts and,
that child is very curious.

00:07:02.647 --> 00:07:04.543
He wants to know: "Why?"

00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:06.983
If you have ever spoken to a little child,

00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:11.103
he will drive you crazy in ten minutes.
Why? Why? Why?

00:07:11.127 --> 00:07:14.183
There is a scientist
in all of you; we suppress him

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:17.903
because we think if we don’t have
the answer, we will look bad.

00:07:17.927 --> 00:07:21.223
I don’t know much, but what I do know is

00:07:21.247 --> 00:07:24.703
that if I want the answer
to some question,

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:28.087
I will be at it until I find the answer.

00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:31.177
