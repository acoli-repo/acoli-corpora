In 2011, with my student Jim,

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:36.933
I decided to use this paper
to build a microscope.

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.332
These bits of paper that you can see

00:04:40.332 --> 00:04:47.332
can be folded by a 10 year old
in five minutes to make a microscope.

00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:50.503
We named it "Foldscope."

00:04:50.527 --> 00:04:56.167
The pictures you are seeing behind me
were all shot by this foldscope.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:03.183
The cost of making this
instrument is 100 rupees,
