This was an awesome thing to find,

00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:04.301
but here's the secret:

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:07.084
for the last 60 years,

00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:09.397
most of the antibiotics on the market

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.630
have come from similar soil bacteria.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.294
Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room

00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:17.060
and on this planet,

00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:21.503
are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics.

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:24.898
Where you used to see dirt,

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:26.853
now think of medication.

00:08:28.402 --> 00:08:31.048
Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues
