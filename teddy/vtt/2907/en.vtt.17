Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues

00:08:31.072 --> 00:08:33.968
who are studying
a pond scum microorganism,

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:37.611
which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in.

00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:42.346
It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.892
except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice,

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.967
it vaccinates against PTSD.

00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:51.746
It vaccinates against fear.

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:56.640
Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope.

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.481
There are so many more microbial examples
