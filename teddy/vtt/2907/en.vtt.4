We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:06.515
But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.755
on this planet.

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:14.270
The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems,

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:19.758
but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems.

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.880
I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers

00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:26.180
at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.798
to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us,
