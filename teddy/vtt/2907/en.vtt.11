I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small

00:05:33.173 --> 00:05:34.331
or only has one cell

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:35.674
can do anything powerful,

00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:37.035
but they can.

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.904
These creatures
are microscopic alchemists,

00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:42.786
with the ability to transform
their environment

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.129
with an arsenal of chemical tools.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.908
This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.319
and they can eat whatever
food is around them.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:56.861
This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:02.590
and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power
