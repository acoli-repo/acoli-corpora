00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.674
and smell of mildew.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:36.189
You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:37.859
that live on our skin.

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:42.359
They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating,

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:44.645
producing the smells of body odor.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.479
You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria

00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:52.163
that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet,

00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:55.311
or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:57.794
and sprayed onto you
with your last shower.

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.817
Sorry.

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.309
(Laughter)
