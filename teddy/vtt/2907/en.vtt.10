00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:01.008
In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards,

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:04.712
investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us,

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:07.272
I'd never made clear
my true mission to him.

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:10.360
My goal is not to find technology

00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:12.784
to kill the new microscopic
life around us.

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:17.447
My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:25.247
The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species.

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:29.239
It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems.
