00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.467
How's it feel? Gross?

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:32.871
In desperate need of soap or bleach?

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:35.986
That's how you feel now,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.622
but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:41.379
For the last 100 years,

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:43.380
we've had an adversarial relationship

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:46.019
with the microscopic life nearest us.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.165
If I told you there was
a bug in your house

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.423
or bacteria in your sink,

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:51.774
there was a human-devised
solution for that,

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.934
a product to eradicate, exterminate,

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.251
disinfect.

00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:00.718
We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now.
