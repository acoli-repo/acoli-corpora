Most of the life around us
remains unknown.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.333
I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.851
It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:11.100
It's white and fluffy,

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:13.668
and I named it "mucor nidicola,"

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.695
meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another.

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:20.796
This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.917
because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool.

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:27.002
At the time, I was in graduate school,

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:30.748
and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form.
