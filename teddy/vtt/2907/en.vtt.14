with a unique ability:

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:03.010
it could make beer.

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:07.411
This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:10.296
In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.823
likely came from one of only
three microorganism species.

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.811
Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey,

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:22.238
and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer.

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.876
In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp,

00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:29.904
it could make a valuable sour beer

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:33.387
better than any other species
on this planet.
