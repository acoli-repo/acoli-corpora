00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.481
There are so many more microbial examples

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:02.649
that I don't have time
to talk about today.

00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:08.506
I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.876
but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.173
might be able to do.

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:18.079
In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.065
or smarter

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:22.912
or perhaps live longer.

00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:26.635
So I want you to look
at your finger again.

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.471
Think about all those
microscopic creatures

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:30.942
that are unknown.
