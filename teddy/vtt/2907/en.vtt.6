00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:00.564
are armed with Q-tips and tweezers

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:02.454
and advanced DNA techniques

00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:05.070
to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us.

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:10.282
In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:12.206
that live in USA homes,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.727
everything from spiders and cockroaches

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.319
to tiny mites that cling to feathers.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.415
And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.454
that live in our dust bunnies,

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:29.012
thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers.
