00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:31.870
We've gone further still,

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:33.610
and we looked at the microorganisms

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:37.762
that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.918
In each bug, for example, a wasp,

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:46.152
we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate,

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:49.453
a world of hundreds of vibrant species.

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:51.930
Behold the biological cosmos!

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.960
So many of the species
you're looking at right now

00:03:55.984 --> 00:03:57.211
don't yet have names.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.726
Most of the life around us
remains unknown.
