I want you to touch your face.

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.857
Go on.

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:06.989
What do you feel?

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:08.896
Soft? Squishy?

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:12.103
It's you, right? You're feeling you?

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.812
Well, it's not quite true.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.632
You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:21.197
that live on our face and fingers.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.203
You're feeling some of the fungi

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.107
that drifted down
from the air ducts today.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.098
They set off our allergies

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.674
and smell of mildew.
