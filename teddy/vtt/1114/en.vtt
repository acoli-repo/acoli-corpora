00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I was born

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on the last day

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the last year of the '70s.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(cheering)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
hip-hop --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Cheering)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My parents were radicals --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
who became,
