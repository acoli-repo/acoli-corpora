I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in African countries,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the same rate as United States.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And you'll find Madagascar,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and you'll find a lot of African countries

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
about as low as the rest of the world.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and things go on in one way in Africa.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We have to stop that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to think that way.
