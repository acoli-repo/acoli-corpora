00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because people still die.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
all people are not reached by treatment,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's not realistic with lifelong treatment

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for everyone in the poorest countries.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But it's very good that what is done is being done.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But focus now is back on prevention.
