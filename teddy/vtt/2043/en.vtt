(Applause)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
These Gapminder bubbles show you

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or how we estimate that it was.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What we are showing here is --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.
