00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that shows how many are infected in each country,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the color is the continent.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, you can see United States, in 1983,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
had a very low percentage infected,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There were quite many people infected in the United States.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And, up there, you see Uganda.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They had almost five percent infected,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.
