00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and this is what happened there.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They started low, they skyrocketed,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
they peaked up there in 2003,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and now they are down.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But they are falling only slowly,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they can manage to treat people.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
These percentages won't come down

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because people can survive 10 to 20 years.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So there's some problem with these metrics now.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,
