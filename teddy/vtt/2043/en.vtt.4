00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Look, India got many infected,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but had a low level.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And almost the same happens here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Russia went to one percent.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In the last two to three years,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
25 years it took.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's just that they have stopped getting worse.
