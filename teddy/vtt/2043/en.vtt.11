00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they have two, three percent infected,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There are now studies clearly showing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, is it poverty?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Well if you look at the macro level,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it seems more money, more HIV.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But that's very simplistic,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so let's go down and look at Tanzania.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I will split Tanzania in five income groups,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
from the highest income to the lowest income,
