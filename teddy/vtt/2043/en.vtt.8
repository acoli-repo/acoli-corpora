00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But focus now is back on prevention.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It is only by stopping the transmission

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that the world will be able to deal with it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but the drugs are very costly for the poor.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Not the drug in itself, but the treatment

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and the care which is needed around it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So, when we look at the pattern,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
one thing comes out very clearly:

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you see the blue bubbles

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and people say HIV is very high in Africa.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.
