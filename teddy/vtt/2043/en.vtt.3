00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
(Laughter)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Applause)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So, ready, steady, go!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
They went upwards like this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
they reached one to two percent.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then, Uganda started to turn back,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.
