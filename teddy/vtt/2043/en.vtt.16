00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
about the spread of HIV.

It could be concurrency.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It could be some virus types.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It could be that there is other things

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
behave tonight and so on.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.
