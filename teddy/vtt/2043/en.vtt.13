00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I've split Kenya in its provinces.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Here it goes.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
See the difference within one African country --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
it goes from very low level to very high level,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, what is it then?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Well, it is more common with multiple partners,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there is less condom use,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and there is age-disparate sex --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men
