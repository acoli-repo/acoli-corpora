00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
from the highest income to the lowest income,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and here we go.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
they have higher HIV.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and it is even bigger among women.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
done by African institutions and researchers

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Look here at Kenya.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I've split Kenya in its provinces.
