00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:31.711
If light were made of tiny, solid balls,

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.642
then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:37.385
would crash into some of the particles from Beam B.

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.879
If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.210
would bounce off in random directions.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.687
But, that doesn't happen.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:45.627
The beams of light pass right through each other

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:46.677
as you can check for yourself

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.939
with two laser pointers and some chalk dust.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.444
For another thing, light makes interference patterns.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:54.946
Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:57.981
when two wave patterns occupy the same space.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.531
They can be seen when two objects

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.755
disturb the surface of a still pond,
