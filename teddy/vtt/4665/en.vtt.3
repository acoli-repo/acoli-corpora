00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.589
and has traveled millions of miles across empty space

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:35.404
before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye,

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:37.616
which is pretty cool when you think about it.

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:40.413
But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:42.134
and how do we see it?

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.885
Is it a particle, like atoms,

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:47.518
or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond?

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.377
Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.658
figuring out the answer to this question.

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:54.429
Isaac Newton was one of the earliest.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.186
Newton believed that light is made up

00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.108
of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles.
