00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.108
of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles.

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:03.984
Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light.

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.378
For example, refraction,

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.738
which is how a beam of light appears to bend

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.744
as it passes from air into water.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:13.865
But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.683
In the 19th century, long after Newton died,

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.788
scientists did a series of experiments

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:21.372
that clearly showed that light can't be made up

00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:23.965
of tiny, atom-like particles.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.900
For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.344
don't interact with each other at all.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:31.711
If light were made of tiny, solid balls,
