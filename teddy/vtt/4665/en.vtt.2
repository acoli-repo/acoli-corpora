00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.176
they simply collect the light that falls into them.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.321
Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.566
that the Greek's couldn't easily explain:

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.893
why it gets dark sometimes.

00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:10.795
The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.109
The special, light-emitting objects,

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.091
like the sun

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.937
or a lightbulb,

00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:17.506
are known as sources of light.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:18.724
Most of the things we see,

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.330
like that pencil on your desk,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.895
are simply reflecting light from a source

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:24.770
rather than producing their own.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.785
So, when you look at your pencil,

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.610
the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.589
and has traveled millions of miles across empty space
