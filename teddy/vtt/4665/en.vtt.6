00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.755
disturb the surface of a still pond,

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.205
and also when two point-like sources of light

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.394
are placed near each other.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.136
Only waves make interference patterns,

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:09.636
particles don't.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.992
And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.992
leads naturally to an explanation of what color is

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:17.695
and why that pencil looks yellow.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:21.036
So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right?

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:22.687
Not so fast!

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:25.378
In the 20th century, scientists did experiments

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:28.432
that appear to show light acting like a particle.

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:31.144
For instance, when you shine light on a metal,
