00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.044
The ancient Greeks were the first

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:31.758
to think more or less scientifically

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:34.401
about what light is and how vision works.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.284
Some Greek philosophers,

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:37.428
including Plato and Pythagoras,

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:39.334
thought that light originated in our eyes

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:41.936
and that vision happened when little, invisible probes

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:44.848
were sent to gather information about far-away objects.

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:46.182
It took over a thousand years

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:48.405
before the Arab scientist, Alhazen,

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:52.119
figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.923
In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:57.012
invisible, intelligence-gathering probes,

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.176
they simply collect the light that falls into them.
