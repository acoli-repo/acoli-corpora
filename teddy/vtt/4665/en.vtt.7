00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:31.144
For instance, when you shine light on a metal,

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.402
the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:37.099
in discrete packets called quanta.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.801
But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either.

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:43.166
So these quanta of light aren't at all like

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.999
the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.752
This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:51.142
and sometimes behaves like a wave,

00:03:51.142 --> 00:03:53.402
led to a revolutionary new physics theory called

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:55.652
quantum mechanics.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.599
So, after all that, let's go back to the question,

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.075
"What is light?"
