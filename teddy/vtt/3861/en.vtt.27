00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.246
But nonetheless, I am devoting
the rest of my life

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.620
to finding another Earth.

00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:38.511
And I can guarantee

00:13:38.535 --> 00:13:40.918
that in the next generation
of space telescopes,

00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:42.482
in the second generation,

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:47.912
we will have the capability
to find and identity other Earths.

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:50.610
And the capability
to split up the starlight

00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:52.187
so that we can look for gases

00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:55.697
and assess the greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,

00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:57.319
estimate the surface temperature,

00:13:57.343 --> 00:13:59.101
and look for signs of life.

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:01.157
But there's more.
