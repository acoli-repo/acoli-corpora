00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:01.353
And actually, I just finished
leading a two-year project

00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:03.465
in this very special phase

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:06.143
of a concept we call the starshade.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:09.120
And the starshade
is a very specially shaped screen

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:11.011
and the goal is to fly that starshade

00:11:11.035 --> 00:11:14.129
so it blocks out the light of a star

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:17.092
so that the telescope
can see the planets directly.

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:19.509
Here, you can see myself
and two team members

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:21.722
holding up one small part
of the starshade.

00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:23.326
It's shaped like a giant flower,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.833
and this is one of the prototype petals.

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:31.368
The concept is that a starshade
and telescope could launch together,
