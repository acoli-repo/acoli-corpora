00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.072
I'm here to tell you
about the real search for alien life.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:07.906
Not little green humanoids
arriving in shiny UFOs,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.654
although that would be nice.

00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:12.955
But it's the search for planets
orbiting stars far away.

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:15.759
Every star in our sky is a sun.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:17.164
And if our sun has planets --

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:19.685
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:22.145
surely those other stars
should have planets also,

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.431
and they do.

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:24.867
And in the last two decades,

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.788
astronomers have found
thousands of exoplanets.

00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:31.313
Our night sky is literally
teeming with exoplanets.
