00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:30.779
by intelligent aliens or by trees,

00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:32.013
or a swamp,

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:34.898
or even just by simple,
single-celled microbial life.

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.091
So working on the models

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:38.766
and thinking about biochemistry,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.987
it's all well and good.

00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.896
But a really big challenge
ahead of us is: how?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.082
How are we going to find these planets?

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:47.310
There are actually many ways
to find planets,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.829
several different ways.

00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:52.712
But the one that I'm most focused on
is how can we open a gateway

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:53.973
so that in the future,

00:10:53.997 --> 00:10:55.846
we can find hundreds of Earths.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.203
We have a real shot
at finding signs of life.

00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:01.353
And actually, I just finished
leading a two-year project
