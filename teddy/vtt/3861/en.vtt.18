00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.372
And that's one of the main things
I'm working on now,

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:02.689
I have a theory about this.

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.001
It reminds me that nearly every day,

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.677
I receive an email or emails

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:11.328
from someone with a crazy theory
about physics of gravity

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:13.184
or cosmology or some such.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:16.541
So, please don't email me
one of your crazy theories.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:17.779
(Laughter)

00:09:17.803 --> 00:09:19.981
Well, I had my own crazy theory.

00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:21.989
But, who does the MIT professor go to?

00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:26.914
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate
in Physiology or Medicine

00:09:26.938 --> 00:09:28.911
and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.934
So I brought my two biochemistry friends
