00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:02.124
This star is called Kepler-186f.

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.727
It's a system of about five planets.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.576
And by the way, most of these exoplanets,
we don't know too much about.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.583
We know their size, and their orbit
and things like that.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:15.569
But there's a very special planet
here called Kepler-186f.

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.697
This planet is in a zone
that is not too far from the star,

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.980
so that the temperature
may be just right for life.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.035
Here, the artist's conception
is just zooming in

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.329
and showing you what that planet
might be like.
