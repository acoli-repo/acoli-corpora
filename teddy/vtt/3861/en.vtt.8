I have a different way
to try to explain to you

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:03.757
some of the things
that we're thinking about exoplanets.

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:04.947
Here's a travel poster:

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.291
"Kepler-186f:

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.029
Where the grass is always redder
on the other side."

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:13.783
That's because Kepler-186f
orbits a red star,

00:04:13.807 --> 00:04:16.499
and we're just speculating
that perhaps the plants there,

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.141
if there is vegetation
that does photosynthesis,

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:21.108
it has different pigments and looks red.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.495
"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.978
a Super-Earth."

00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.159
This planet is more massive than Earth
