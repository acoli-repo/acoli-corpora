00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:00.006
and the variety
is just simply astonishing,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.160
we mostly want to find the planets
that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.101
Not too big, not too small,

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.972
not too hot, not too cold --

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:10.345
but just right for life.

00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:12.776
But to do that,
we'd have to be able to look

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.134
at the planet's atmosphere,

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.954
because the atmosphere
acts like a blanket trapping heat --

00:06:16.978 --> 00:06:18.314
the greenhouse effect.

00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:21.158
We have to be able to assess
the greenhouse gases

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:22.332
on other planets.

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.288
Well, science fiction
got some things wrong.

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:27.186
The Star Trek Enterprise

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.837
had to travel vast distances
at incredible speeds
