So, many people have this
romantic notion of astronomers

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.256
going to the telescope
on a lonely mountaintop

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.829
and looking at the spectacular night sky
through a big telescope.

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:47.225
But actually, we just work
on our computers like everyone else,

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.074
and we get our data by email
or downloading from a database.

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:53.621
So instead of coming here to tell you

00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:56.776
about the somewhat tedious nature
of the data and data analysis

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.866
and the complex computer models we make,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.088
I have a different way
to try to explain to you
