00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:01.711
But what's so awesome to consider

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.784
is that if there are intelligent aliens

00:13:04.808 --> 00:13:08.762
orbiting on a planet
around a star near to us

00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:10.831
and they build complicated
space telescopes

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:12.782
of the kind that we're trying to build,

00:13:12.806 --> 00:13:15.306
all they'll see is this pale blue dot,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.615
a pinprick of light.

00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:20.522
And so sometimes, when I pause to think

00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:24.799
about my professional struggle
and huge ambition,

00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:26.816
it's hard to think about that

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.259
in contrast to the vastness
of the universe.
