This planet is more massive than Earth

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:31.905
and has a higher surface gravity.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.230
"Relax on Kepler-16b,

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.150
where your shadow always has company."

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:39.134
(Laughter)

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:43.340
We know of a dozen planets
that orbit two stars,

00:04:43.364 --> 00:04:45.483
and there's likely many more out there.

00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:47.468
If we could visit one of those planets,

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:49.379
you literally would see two sunsets

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:50.658
and have two shadows.

00:04:51.484 --> 00:04:53.901
So actually, science fiction
got some things right.

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:55.134
Tatooine from Star Wars.

00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:58.342
And I have a couple of other
favorite exoplanets

00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.563
to tell you about.

00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.119
This one is Kepler-10b,
