The second question
that we often think about is:

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.030
Are we alone?

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.299
Is there life out there?

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.601
Who is out there?

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:10.789
You know, this question has been around
for thousands of years,

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:13.230
since at least the time
of the Greek philosophers.

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:15.801
But I'm here to tell you
just how close we're getting

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.706
to finding out the answer
to this question.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.945
It's the first time in human history
that this really is within reach for us.

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:26.273
Now when I think about the possibilities
for life out there,

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:30.384
I think of the fact that our sun
is but one of many stars.
