as well as some spacecraft
that are also orbiting our sun.

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:36.332
Now if we can imagine going
to the West Coast of North America,

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.482
and looking out at the night sky,

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.784
here's what we'd see on a spring night.

00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:42.818
And you can see
the constellations overlaid

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:45.111
and again, so many stars with planets.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:49.329
There's a special patch of the sky
where we have thousands of planets.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:53.043
This is where the Kepler Space Telescope
focused for many years.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:58.250
Let's zoom in and look
at one of the favorite exoplanets.

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:02.124
This star is called Kepler-186f.
