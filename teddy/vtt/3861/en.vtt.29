00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:30.973
Thank you.

00:14:30.997 --> 00:14:37.508
(Applause)

00:14:37.532 --> 00:14:39.632
June Cohen: And I give you,
for a question,

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:41.384
Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.

00:14:41.817 --> 00:14:43.848
Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through

00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:47.659
that the technology
to actually look at the spectrum

00:14:47.683 --> 00:14:50.312
of an exoplanet like Earth
is not there yet.

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.223
When do you expect this will be there,

00:14:52.247 --> 00:14:53.515
and what's needed?

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:58.154
Actually, what we expect is what we call
our next-generation Hubble telescope.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:00.872
And this is called the James Webb
Space Telescope,
