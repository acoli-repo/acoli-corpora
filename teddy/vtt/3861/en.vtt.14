taken by the shuttle Atlantis
as it was departing

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.334
after the last
human space flight to Hubble.

00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:04.244
They installed a new camera, actually,

00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:06.413
that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:11.342
And so far, we've been able to study
dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:13.490
about six of them in great detail.

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.686
But those are not
small planets like Earth.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.104
They're big, hot planets
that are easy to see.

00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:19.366
We're not ready,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.765
we don't have the right technology yet
to study small exoplanets.

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:25.264
But nevertheless,

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:29.185
I wanted to try to explain to you
how we study exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:31.874
I want you to imagine,
for a moment, a rainbow.
