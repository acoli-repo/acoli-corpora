00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, the biologists get furious
with me for saying that,

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:05.948
because we have absolutely no evidence
for life beyond Earth yet.

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:11.770
Well, if we were able to look
at our galaxy from the outside

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:14.002
and zoom in to where our sun is,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.586
we see a real map of the stars.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:19.069
And the highlighted stars
are those with known exoplanets.

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.934
This is really just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.284
Here, this animation is zooming in
onto our solar system.

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.357
And you'll see here the planets

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.214
as well as some spacecraft
that are also orbiting our sun.
