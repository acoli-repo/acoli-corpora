WEBVTT

00:09:59.948 --> 00:10:01.729
So, we went back to the drawing board

00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:05.181
and we think we have found something
very interesting in another field.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:06.625
But back to exoplanets,

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:09.928
the point is that life produces
so many different types of gases,

00:10:09.952 --> 00:10:12.164
literally thousands of gases.

00:10:12.188 --> 00:10:14.855
And so what we're doing now
is just trying to figure out

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:16.468
on which types of exoplanets,

00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:19.712
which gases could be attributed to life.

00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:24.230
And so when it comes time
when we find gases

00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:25.605
in exoplanet atmospheres

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.725
that we won't know
if they're being produced

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:30.779
by intelligent aliens or by trees,
