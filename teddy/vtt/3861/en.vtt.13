WEBVTT

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.837
had to travel vast distances
at incredible speeds

00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.590
to orbit other planets

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:36.590
so that First Officer Spock
could analyze the atmosphere

00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:38.575
to see if the planet was habitable

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.272
or if there were lifeforms there.

00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:43.235
Well, we don't need
to travel at warp speeds

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.388
to see other planet atmospheres,

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:48.196
although I don't want to dissuade
any budding engineers

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.143
from figuring out how to do that.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.459
We actually can and do study
planet atmospheres

00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:54.096
from here, from Earth orbit.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.297
This is a picture, a photograph
of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.071
taken by the shuttle Atlantis
as it was departing
