00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.119
This one is Kepler-10b,

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.126
it's a hot, hot planet.

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:06.577
It orbits over 50 times closer to its star

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.768
than our Earth does to our sun.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.372
And actually, it's so hot,

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.029
we can't visit any
of these planets, but if we could,

00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:15.027
we would melt long before we got there.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:17.380
We think the surface
is hot enough to melt rock

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:18.830
and has liquid lava lakes.

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.041
Gliese 1214b.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.164
This planet, we know the mass and the size

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.776
and it has a fairly low density.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.998
It's somewhat warm.

00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:28.737
We actually don't know
really anything about this planet,

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.266
but one possibility
is that it's a water world,
