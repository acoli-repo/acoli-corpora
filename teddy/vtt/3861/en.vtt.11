00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.266
but one possibility
is that it's a water world,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.797
like a scaled-up version
of one of Jupiter's icy moons

00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:37.304
that might be 50 percent water by mass.

00:05:37.328 --> 00:05:40.289
And in this case, it would have
a thick steam atmosphere

00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:42.169
overlaying an ocean,

00:05:42.193 --> 00:05:43.703
not of liquid water,

00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.732
but of an exotic form
of water, a superfluid --

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.746
not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.370
And under that wouldn't be rock,

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:51.990
but a form of high-pressure ice,

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:53.290
like ice IX.

00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:56.768
So out of all these planets out there,

00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:00.006
and the variety
is just simply astonishing,
