I think of the fact that our sun
is but one of many stars.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.703
This is a photograph of a real galaxy,

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:35.173
we think our Milky Way
looks like this galaxy.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:36.836
It's a collection of bound stars.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.247
But our [sun] is one
of hundreds of billions of stars

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.595
and our galaxy is one of upwards
of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.474
Knowing that small planets
are very common,

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:50.772
you can just do the math.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:55.425
And there are just so many stars
and so many planets out there,

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.139
that surely, there must be life
somewhere out there.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, the biologists get furious
with me for saying that,
