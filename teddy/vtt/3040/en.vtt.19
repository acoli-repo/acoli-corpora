00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:32.086
So I replaced them
with a more manageable technology:

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.437
magnets.

00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:38.592
Magnets made our Harvard freshman
able to wear jeans on campus,

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:40.171
because he could dress himself.

00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:42.991
Second: adjustability.

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:45.963
Pant lengths, sleeve lengths, waistbands

00:09:45.987 --> 00:09:48.726
were a challenge for so many
different-shaped bodies.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.803
So I added elastic,

00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:52.792
an internal hemming system.

00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:56.584
This way, Gianna could wear
a shirt right off the rack

00:09:56.608 --> 00:09:58.471
and just adjust the one sleeve.

00:09:59.123 --> 00:10:02.582
Last: alternate ways to get
the clothing on and off the body,
