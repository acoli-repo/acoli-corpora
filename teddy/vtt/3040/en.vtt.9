Adaptive clothing is defined as clothing
designed for people with disabilities,

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:33.169
the elderly

00:04:33.193 --> 00:04:36.922
and anyone who struggles
with dressing themselves.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.080
Adaptive clothing did exist,

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.877
but it was missing that mainstream
fashion component.

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:47.451
It was very medicinal and very functional

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:48.904
but not stylish.

00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:51.782
And that's a huge problem,

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:54.463
because what you wear matters.

00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:57.237
Clothing can affect your mood,

00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:58.412
your health

00:04:58.436 --> 00:04:59.759
and your self-esteem.
