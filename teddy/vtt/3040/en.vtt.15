00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.303
I had to truly understand
the clothing challenges

00:07:33.327 --> 00:07:35.798
of as many different people
as I possibly could.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:41.247
I met a young man who was 18
who has cerebral palsy.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.706
He was going to Harvard University.

00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:46.742
He said to me, "Can you imagine?

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.655
I got myself into Harvard,

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:53.525
but my dream is to be able
to wear jeans on campus,

00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:55.338
like the other freshmen will wear."

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:58.160
I met a little girl named Gianna,

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:01.903
who was missing
her left forearm and her hand.
