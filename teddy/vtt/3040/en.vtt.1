When I was younger,

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.439
I wanted to be Betsey Johnson.

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:36.806
I thought we were kindred,
crazy-hair spirits together.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.373
I did go to fashion design,

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:41.956
I worked in the industry for years

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.237
and loved it.

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.112
I married,

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:46.701
I had three kids.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:51.439
But life can be heartbreakingly ironic.

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:58.549
My middle child, Oliver, was born
with a rare form of muscular dystrophy,

00:00:58.573 --> 00:00:59.726
or MD.
