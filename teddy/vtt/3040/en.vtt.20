Last: alternate ways to get
the clothing on and off the body,

00:10:02.606 --> 00:10:05.455
outside the traditional way
of over your head.

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:08.934
So I designed a way to go in arms first.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.814
This, for somebody like Eric,

00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:15.023
could actually take five steps
off his dressing process

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:18.381
and give him back the gift of time.

00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:21.544
So I went out,

00:10:21.568 --> 00:10:23.763
I bought clothing right off the rack,

00:10:23.787 --> 00:10:26.820
I sat at my kitchen table,
ripped them apart,

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:32.542
did prototype after prototype,
until I felt I had great modifications.
