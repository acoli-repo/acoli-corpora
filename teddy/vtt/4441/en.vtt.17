00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:32.993
in which over 100,000 Japanese Americans
had been interned in camps.

00:08:33.017 --> 00:08:35.414
My favorite person
to challenge this scheme

00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:36.748
was Gordon Hirabayashi,

00:08:36.772 --> 00:08:38.942
a University of Washington student.

00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:41.125
He turned himself in to the FBI,

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:43.304
who said, "Look,
you're a first-time offender,

00:08:43.328 --> 00:08:44.506
you can go home."

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.705
And Gordon said,

00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:49.831
"No, I'm a Quaker,
I have to resist unjust laws,"

00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:52.426
and so they arrested him
and he was convicted.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.084
Gordon's case made it
to the Supreme Court.

00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:56.887
And again, I'm going to do that thing

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.363
where I quash any sense
of anticipation you have,

00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:01.164
and tell you what happened.
