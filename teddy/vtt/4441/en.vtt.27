00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:31.853
me, a child of a man who came here
with eight dollars in his pocket,

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:34.750
could stand in the Supreme Court
of the United States

00:13:34.774 --> 00:13:37.107
on behalf of a detested foreigner,

00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:39.358
like Osama bin Laden's driver,

00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:40.573
and win.

00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:41.953
And it made me realize,

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:44.596
even though I may have lost the case,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.720
I was right about the Muslim ban too.

00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:48.577
No matter what the court decided,

00:13:48.601 --> 00:13:50.116
they couldn't change the fact

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.653
that immigrants
do strengthen this country.

00:13:52.677 --> 00:13:56.955
Indeed, in many ways,
immigrants love this country the most.

00:13:56.979 --> 00:13:59.315
When I read Ann Coulter's words,

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.371
I thought about the glorious
words of our Constitution.
