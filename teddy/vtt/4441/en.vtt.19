His staff begged the Solicitor General,

00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:37.688
"Tell the truth, don't suppress evidence."

00:09:37.712 --> 00:09:39.490
What did the Solicitor General do?

00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:40.696
Nothing.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.282
He went in and told
the "military necessity" story.

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:48.631
And so the Court upheld
Gordon Hirabayashi's conviction.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:52.933
And the next year, upheld
Fred Korematsu's interment.

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:55.231
Now why was I thinking about that?

00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:57.374
Because nearly 70 years later,

00:09:57.398 --> 00:09:59.434
I got to hold the same office,

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.704
Head of the Solicitor General's Office.
