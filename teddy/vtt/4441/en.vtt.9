00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.633
I knew I had to avoid emotion.

00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:32.823
Displays of emotion fail.

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:36.260
It's kind of like writing an email
in all bold and all caps.

00:04:36.284 --> 00:04:37.776
It persuades no one.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.990
It's then about you, the speaker,

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:42.410
not about the listener or the receiver.

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:46.291
Now look, in some settings,
the solution is to be emotional.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:47.903
You're arguing with your parents,

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.871
and you use emotion and it works.

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.045
Why?

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.514
Because your parents love you.

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:54.704
But Supreme Court justices don't love you.

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.546
They don't like to think of themselves

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.571
as the type of people
persuaded by emotion.

00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:00.988
And I reverse engineered that insight too,
