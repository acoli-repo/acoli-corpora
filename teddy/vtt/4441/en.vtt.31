00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.256
I'm not telling you how to win arguments
for the sake of winning arguments.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.906
This isn't a game.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.128
I'm telling you this
because even if you don't win right now,

00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:39.854
if you make a good argument,
history will prove you right.

00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:42.934
I think back to that acting
coach all the time.

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.434
And I've come to realize

00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:48.448
that the hand I was holding
was the hand of justice.

00:15:48.472 --> 00:15:51.377
That outstretched hand will come for you.

00:15:51.401 --> 00:15:54.563
It's your decision to push it away

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:55.762
or to keep holding it.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.539
Thank you so much for listening.
