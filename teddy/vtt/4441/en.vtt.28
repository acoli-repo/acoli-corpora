00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.371
I thought about the glorious
words of our Constitution.

00:14:02.395 --> 00:14:03.704
The First Amendment.

00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:07.529
Congress shall make no law
establishing religion.

00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:09.831
I thought about our national creed,

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:11.570
"E plurbis unum,"

00:14:11.594 --> 00:14:13.667
"out of many come one."

00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:15.720
Most of all, I realized,

00:14:15.744 --> 00:14:19.125
the only way you can truly
lose an argument

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:20.545
is by giving up.

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:23.641
So I joined the lawsuit by the US Congress

00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:28.923
challenging President Trump's addition
of a citizenship question to the census.

00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:31.352
A decision with huge implications.
