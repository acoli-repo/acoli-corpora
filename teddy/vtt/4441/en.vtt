00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:02.286
Fourteen years ago,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.476
I stood in the Supreme Court
to argue my first case.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.889
And it wasn't just any case,

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.744
it was a case that experts called

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:12.400
one of the most important cases
the Supreme Court had ever heard.

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:16.021
It considered whether Guantanamo
was constitutional,

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:19.542
and whether the Geneva Conventions
applied to the war on terror.

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.709
It was just a handful of years
after the horrific attacks

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.933
of September 11.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.331
The Supreme Court
had seven Republican appointees

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:29.204
and two Democratic ones,

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.770
and my client happened to be
Osama bin Laden's driver.
