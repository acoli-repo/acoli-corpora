WEBVTT

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:01.141
it includes these other people too."

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:04.067
Now I thought we had
the killer answer to that.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.831
I won't bore you with the details,

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.855
but the thing is, we lost.

00:08:09.163 --> 00:08:10.933
Five votes to four.

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.322
And I was devastated.

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:15.733
I was worried my powers
of persuasion had waned.

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:17.744
And then, two things happened.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:18.990
The first was,

00:08:19.014 --> 00:08:22.574
I noticed a part of the Supreme
Court's travel ban opinion

00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:25.312
that discussed the Japanese
American interment.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.670
That was a horrific moment in our history,

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:32.993
in which over 100,000 Japanese Americans
had been interned in camps.
