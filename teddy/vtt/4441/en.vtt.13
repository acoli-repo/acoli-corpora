00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:30.498
By methodically building the case,

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:32.791
and getting into the justices' heads,

00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:36.300
we were able to quite literally
change the world.

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:38.256
Sounds easy, right?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.901
You can practice a lot,

00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:41.376
avoid displays of emotion,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.400
and you, too, can win any argument.

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:46.355
I'm sorry to say, it's not that simple,

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.315
my strategies aren't foolproof,

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:50.812
and while I've won
more Supreme Court cases

00:06:50.836 --> 00:06:52.193
than most anyone,

00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:54.233
I've also lost a lot too.

00:06:54.257 --> 00:06:56.709
Indeed, after Donald Trump was elected,

00:06:56.733 --> 00:07:00.468
I was, constitutionally
speaking, terrified.
