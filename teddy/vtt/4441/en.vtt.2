00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.045
How?

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.772
Today, I'm going to talk
about how to win an argument,

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.796
at the Supreme Court or anywhere.

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:09.463
The conventional wisdom
is that you speak with confidence.

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.133
That's how you persuade.

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:13.095
I think that's wrong.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.367
I think confidence
is the enemy of persuasion.

00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:18.815
Persuasion is about empathy,

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.839
about getting into people's heads.

00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:23.172
That's what makes TED what it is.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:25.387
It's why you're listening to this talk.

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.347
You could have read it on the cold page,

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.529
but you didn't.

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:30.712
Same thing with Supreme Court arguments --
