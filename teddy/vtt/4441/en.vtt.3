00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:30.712
Same thing with Supreme Court arguments --

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:33.768
we write written briefs with cold pages,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.537
but we also have an oral argument.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.543
We don't just have a system
in which the justices write questions

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:40.871
and you write answers.

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.085
Why?

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.529
Because argument is about interaction.

00:01:44.553 --> 00:01:48.066
I want to take you behind the scenes
to tell you what I did,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.479
and how these lessons are generalizable.

00:01:50.503 --> 00:01:53.129
Not just for winning an argument in court,

00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:55.153
but for something far more profound.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:58.387
Now obviously,
it's going to involve practice,

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.291
but not just any practice will do.
