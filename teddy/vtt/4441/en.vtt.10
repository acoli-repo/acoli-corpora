00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:00.988
And I reverse engineered that insight too,

00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:05.020
setting a trap for my opponent
to provoke his emotional reaction,

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:08.567
so I could be seen as the calm
and steady voice of the law.

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:10.415
And it worked.

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.569
And I remember sitting in the courtroom
to learn that we had won.

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:17.418
That the Guantanamo tribunals
were coming down.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:21.236
And I went out onto the courthouse steps
and there was a media firestorm.

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.855
Five hundred cameras,
and they're all asking me,

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.164
"What does the decision mean,
what does it say?"

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:28.474
Well, the decision was 185 pages long.

00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:30.696
I hadn't had time to read it, nobody had.
