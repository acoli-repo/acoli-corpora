00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.770
and my client happened to be
Osama bin Laden's driver.

00:00:33.147 --> 00:00:36.131
My opponent was the Solicitor General
of the United States,

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:38.028
America's top courtroom lawyer.

00:00:38.052 --> 00:00:39.974
He had argued 35 cases.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:42.268
I wasn't even 35 years old.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.847
And to make matters worse,

00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:47.045
the Senate, for the first time
since the Civil War,

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:51.869
passed a bill to try and remove the case
from the docket of the Supreme Court.

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:53.520
Now the speaking coaches say

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:56.700
I'm supposed to build tension
and not tell you what happens.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:58.847
But the thing is, we won.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.045
How?
