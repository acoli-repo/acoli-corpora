00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.388
And he came into my office one day
wearing a billowy white shirt

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:35.420
and a bolo tie,

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:38.944
and he looked at me
with my folded arms and said,

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:40.926
"Look, Neal, I can tell

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.983
that you don't think
this is going to work,

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.316
but just humor me.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.617
Tell me your argument."

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.283
So I grabbed my legal pad,

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:49.340
and I started reading my argument.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:50.799
He said, "What are you doing?"

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.672
I said, "I'm telling you my argument."

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:54.664
He said, "Your argument is a legal pad?"

00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:57.526
I said, "No, but my argument
is on a legal pad."

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.772
He said, "Neal, look at me.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.003
Tell me your argument."
