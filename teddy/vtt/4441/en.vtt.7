00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:30.442
And I realized, "Wow, that's connection.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.728
That's the power of how to persuade."

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:34.307
And it helped.

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.780
But truthfully, I still got nervous
as the argument date approached.

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:39.923
And I knew that even though argument

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:42.201
was about getting
into someone else's shoes

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:43.458
and empathizing,

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:46.243
I needed to have a solid core first.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.760
So I did something
outside of my comfort zone.

00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:51.058
I wore jewelry -- not just anything,

00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:54.336
but a bracelet that my father
had worn his whole life,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.598
until he passed away,
just a few months before the argument.

00:03:57.622 --> 00:03:58.783
I put on a tie

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.315
that my mom had given me
just for the occasion.
