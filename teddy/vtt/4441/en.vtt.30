00:14:58.661 --> 00:15:00.463
and bends, often, slowly,

00:15:00.487 --> 00:15:03.209
but it bends so long as we bend it.

00:15:03.598 --> 00:15:07.636
And I've realized the question
is not how to win every argument.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:11.152
It's how to get back up when you do lose.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.533
Because in the long run,

00:15:12.557 --> 00:15:15.014
good arguments will win out.

00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:16.760
If you make a good argument,

00:15:16.784 --> 00:15:19.101
it has the power to outlive you,

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.156
to stretch beyond your core,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.500
to reach those future minds.

00:15:23.828 --> 00:15:26.256
And that's why all of this
is so important.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.256
I'm not telling you how to win arguments
for the sake of winning arguments.
