00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:33.363
banning immigration from seven countries
with overwhelmingly Muslim populations.

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.990
My legal team and others
went into court right away and sued,

00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:39.839
and got that first travel ban struck down.

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:41.252
Trump revised it.

00:07:41.276 --> 00:07:43.871
We went into court again
and got that struck down.

00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:45.925
He revised it again,

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:48.276
and changed it, adding North Korea,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.482
because we all know,

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:53.328
the United States had a tremendous
immigration problem with North Korea.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:56.756
But it did enable his lawyers
to go to the Supreme Court and say,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.034
"See, this isn't discriminating
against Muslims,

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:01.141
it includes these other people too."
