00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.291
but not just any practice will do.

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:02.476
My first practice session for Guantanamo,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.668
I flew up to Harvard

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:08.243
and had all these legendary professors
throwing questions at me.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.783
And even though I had read everything,
rehearsed a million times,

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:14.014
I wasn't persuading anyone.

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:16.164
My arguments weren't resonating.

00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:17.387
I was desperate.

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:18.903
I had done everything possible,

00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:21.347
read every book,
rehearsed a million times,

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.129
and it wasn't going anywhere.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.272
So ultimately, I stumbled on this guy --

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:27.582
he was an acting coach,
he wasn't even a lawyer.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.836
He'd never set foot in the Supreme Court.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.388
And he came into my office one day
wearing a billowy white shirt
