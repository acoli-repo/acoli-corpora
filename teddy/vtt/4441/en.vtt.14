00:06:56.733 --> 00:07:00.468
I was, constitutionally
speaking, terrified.

00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:03.087
Please understand,
this is not about Left versus Right,

00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.405
or anything like that.

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.206
I'm not here to talk about that.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.837
But just a week in
to the new president's term,

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.528
you might remember
those scenes at the airports.

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:15.679
President Trump had campaigned
on a pledge, saying, quote,

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:19.580
"I, Donald J. Trump am calling
for a complete and total shutdown

00:07:19.604 --> 00:07:22.596
of all Muslim immigration
to the United States."

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.793
And he also said, quote,
"I think Islam hates us."

00:07:25.817 --> 00:07:27.642
And he made good on that promise,

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:33.363
banning immigration from seven countries
with overwhelmingly Muslim populations.
