00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.958
It took emotion outside the courtroom
to get me back in.

00:12:08.982 --> 00:12:13.180
When I read Coulter's words, I was angry.

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.451

00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:19.930
that being a first-generation American
would disqualify me.

00:12:19.954 --> 00:12:23.193
I rebel against the idea
that mass immigration

00:12:23.217 --> 00:12:24.788

instead of recognizing that as literally
the rock on which this country was built.
