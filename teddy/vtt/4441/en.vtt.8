00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.315
that my mom had given me
just for the occasion.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:05.768
And I took out my legal pad
and wrote my children's names on it,

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.926
because that's why I was doing this.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.577
For them, to leave the country better
than I had found it.

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.887
I got to court, and I was calm.

00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:17.221
The bracelet, the tie,
the children's names

00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:18.791
had all centered me.

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:21.902
Like a rock climber
extending beyond the precipice,

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:25.101
if you have a solid hold,
you can reach out.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:28.609
And because argument is about persuasion,

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.633
I knew I had to avoid emotion.
