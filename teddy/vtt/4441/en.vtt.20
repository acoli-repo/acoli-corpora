00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.704
Head of the Solicitor General's Office.

00:10:01.728 --> 00:10:03.895
And I got to set the record straight,

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:08.117
explaining that the government
had misrepresented the facts

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:10.623
in the Japanese interment cases.

00:10:10.647 --> 00:10:14.204
And when I thought about the Supreme
Court's travel ban opinion,

00:10:14.228 --> 00:10:15.744
I realized something.

00:10:15.768 --> 00:10:17.475
The Supreme Court, in that opinion,

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:22.185
went out of its way
to overrule the Korematsu case.

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:25.820
Now, not only had the Justice
Department said

00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:28.193
the Japanese interment was wrong,

00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:30.920
the Supreme Court said so too.
