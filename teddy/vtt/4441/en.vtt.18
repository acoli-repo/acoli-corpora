00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:01.164
and tell you what happened.

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:02.490
Gordon lost.

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:04.886
But he lost because of a simple reason.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:06.784
Because the Solicitor General,

00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:09.434
that top courtroom lawyer
for the government,

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:11.213
told the Supreme Court

00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:15.467
that the Japanese American internment
was justified by military necessity.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.314
And that was so,

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:19.798
even though his own staff had discovered

00:09:19.822 --> 00:09:23.628
that there was no need
for the Japanese American interment

00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:27.088
and that the FBI
and the intelligence community

00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:28.533
all believed that.

00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:31.810
And indeed, that it was motivated
by racial prejudice.
