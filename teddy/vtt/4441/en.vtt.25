00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.317
When I read Coulter,

00:12:31.341 --> 00:12:34.110
I thought about so many things in my past.

00:12:34.134 --> 00:12:35.499
I thought about my dad,

00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:38.133
who arrived here
with eight dollars from India,

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:41.667
and didn't know whether to use
the colored bathroom or the white one.

00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:45.495
I thought about his first job offer,
at a slaughter house.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.272
Not a great job for a Hindu.

00:12:47.296 --> 00:12:51.634
I thought about how, when we moved
to a new neighborhood in Chicago

00:12:51.658 --> 00:12:53.625
with one other Indian family,

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:56.249
that family had a cross 
burned on its lawn.

00:12:56.273 --> 00:12:58.066
Because the racists aren't very good

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.939
at distinguishing between
African Americans and Hindus.
