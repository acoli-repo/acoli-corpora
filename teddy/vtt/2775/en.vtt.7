00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.515
growing off the basalt of this
massive undersea mountain,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.903
and the dark sort of stuff,
those are fossilized corals,

00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:37.238
and we're going to talk
a little more about those

00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:38.610
as we travel back in time.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.515
To do that, we need
to charter a research boat.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.579
This is the James Cook,
an ocean-class research vessel

00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:45.873
moored up in Tenerife.

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.229
Looks beautiful, right?

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:49.384
Great, if you're not a great mariner.

00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:52.206
Sometimes it looks
a little more like this.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.429
This is us trying to make sure
that we don't lose precious samples.

00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:58.270
Everyone's scurrying around,
and I get terribly seasick,

00:03:58.294 --> 00:04:01.288
so it's not always a lot of fun,
but overall it is.
