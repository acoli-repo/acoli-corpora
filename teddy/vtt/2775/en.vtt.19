00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:31.060
during this transition from the glacial
to the interglacial.

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:32.291
We don't really know why,

00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:34.864
but we think it's something
to do with the food source

00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:36.845
and maybe the oxygen in the water.

00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:38.873
So here we are.

00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:41.945
I'm going to illustrate what I think
we've found about climate

00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:43.929
from those corals in the Southern Ocean.

00:09:43.953 --> 00:09:47.228
We went up and down sea mountains.
We collected little fossil corals.

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:48.778
This is my illustration of that.

00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:50.207
We think back in the glacial,

00:09:50.231 --> 00:09:52.254
from the analysis
we've made in the corals,

00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:55.364
that the deep part of the Southern Ocean
was very rich in carbon,

00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:58.077
and there was a low-density
layer sitting on top.

00:09:58.101 --> 00:10:00.894
That stops carbon dioxide
coming out of the ocean.
