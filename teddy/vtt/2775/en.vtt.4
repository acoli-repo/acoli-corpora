00:01:58.153 --> 00:02:01.384
And we know this from ice cores,
because if you drill down into ice,

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:04.679
you find annual bands of ice,
and you can see this in the iceberg.

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:06.694
You can see those blue-white layers.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:10.344
Gases are trapped in the ice cores,
so we can measure CO2 --

00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:12.733
that's why we know CO2
was lower in the past --

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.750
and the chemistry of the ice
also tells us about temperature

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:17.249
in the polar regions.

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:20.952
And if you move in time
from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:22.785
you see that temperature increased.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.434
It didn't increase smoothly.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.236
Sometimes it increased very rapidly,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.504
then there was a plateau,

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:28.793
then it increased rapidly.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.841
It was different in the two polar regions,
