00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.462
Two dimensions, such as this
beautiful two-dimensional image

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:35.080
of the sea surface temperature.

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:39.128
This was taken using satellite,
so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:42.764
The overall features are extremely
easy to understand.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:46.452
The equatorial regions are warm
because there's more sunlight.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:49.162
The polar regions are cold
because there's less sunlight.

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:52.107
And that allows big icecaps
to build up on Antarctica

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:53.941
and up in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.717
If you plunge deep into the sea,
or even put your toes in the sea,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.684
you know it gets colder as you go down,

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.687
and that's mostly because the deep waters
that fill the abyss of the ocean
