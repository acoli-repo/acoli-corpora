00:06:58.121 --> 00:07:00.414
this is about 100 microns across.

00:07:00.763 --> 00:07:03.254
And Brendan took some analyses
across this coral --

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:05.084
you can see the marks --

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:08.067
and he's been able to show
that these are actual annual bands,

00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.004
so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:12.796
corals can record seasonal changes,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.552
which is pretty spectacular.

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:18.374
But 4,000 years is not enough to get
us back to our last glacial maximum.

00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:19.556
So what do we do?

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.587
We go in for these fossil specimens.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.111
This is what makes me really unpopular
with my research team.

00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:26.285
So going along,

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.927
there's giant sharks everywhere,

00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.449
there are pyrosomes,
there are swimming holothurians,
