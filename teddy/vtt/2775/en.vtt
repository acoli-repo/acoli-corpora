00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:02.199
Well, I'm an ocean chemist.

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:04.342
I look at the chemistry
of the ocean today.

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.366
I look at the chemistry
of the ocean in the past.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.454
The way I look back in the past

00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:12.629
is by using the fossilized remains
of deepwater corals.

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:15.295
You can see an image of one
of these corals behind me.

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.745
It was collected from close to Antarctica,
thousands of meters below the sea,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.857
so, very different
than the kinds of corals

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.668
you may have been lucky enough to see
if you've had a tropical holiday.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.748
So I'm hoping that this talk will give you

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.565
a four-dimensional view of the ocean.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.462
Two dimensions, such as this
beautiful two-dimensional image
