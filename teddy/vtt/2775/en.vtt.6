00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:00.392
This is some spectacular footage
coming from a seamount

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:02.605
about a kilometer deep
in international waters

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.609
in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:08.682
You're amongst the first people
to see this bit of the seafloor,

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:10.348
along with my research team.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.084
You're probably seeing new species.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:14.260
We don't know.

00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:17.944
You'd have to collect the samples
and do some very intense taxonomy.

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:19.861
You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:22.139
There are brittle stars
growing on these corals.

00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:25.219
Those are things that look
like tentacles coming out of corals.

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:28.115
There are corals made of different forms
of calcium carbonate

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.515
growing off the basalt of this
massive undersea mountain,
