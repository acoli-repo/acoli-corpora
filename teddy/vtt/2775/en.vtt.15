00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.449
there are pyrosomes,
there are swimming holothurians,

00:07:30.473 --> 00:07:31.744
there's giant sponges,

00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:34.363
but I make everyone go down
to these dead fossil areas

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.943
and spend ages kind of shoveling
around on the seafloor.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:41.332
And we pick up all these corals,
bring them back, we sort them out.

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:43.651
But each one of these is a different age,

00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:45.576
and if we can find out how old they are

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.112
and then we can measure
those chemical signals,

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:49.558
this helps us to find out

00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:52.065
what's been going on
in the ocean in the past.

00:07:52.558 --> 00:07:54.262
So on the left-hand image here,

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:57.318
I've taken a slice through a coral,
polished it very carefully

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.312
and taken an optical image.

00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:00.488
On the right-hand side,
