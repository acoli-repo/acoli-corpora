00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:33.392
over part of the ocean that would
look featureless on a big-scale map,

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:36.673
but actually some of these mountains
are as big as Everest.

00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:38.626
So with the maps that we make on board,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.642
we get about 100-meter resolution,

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:43.555
enough to pick out areas
to deploy our equipment,

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:45.493
but not enough to see very much.

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.239
To do that, we need to fly
remotely-operated vehicles

00:04:48.263 --> 00:04:50.477
about five meters off the seafloor.

00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.716
And if we do that, we can get maps
that are one-meter resolution

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.834
down thousands of meters.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.675
Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.010
a research-grade vehicle.
