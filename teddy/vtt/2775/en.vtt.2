00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.687
and that's mostly because the deep waters
that fill the abyss of the ocean

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.876
come from the cold polar regions
where the waters are dense.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:10.951
If we travel back in time
20,000 years ago,

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.835
the earth looked very much different.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.326
And I've just given you a cartoon version
of one of the major differences

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.605
you would have seen
if you went back that long.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.311
The icecaps were much bigger.

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:23.962
They covered lots of the continent,
and they extended out over the ocean.

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:26.479
Sea level was 120 meters lower.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.047
Carbon dioxide [levels] were very
much lower than they are today.
