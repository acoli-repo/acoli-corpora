00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:32.133
we can then go back,
collect fossil specimens,

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:35.301
and reconstruct what the ocean
used to look like in the past.

00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:38.761
And here you can see us collecting
that coral with a vacuum system,

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:41.386
and we put it into a sampling container.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.469
We can do this very
carefully, I should add.

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:45.878
Some of these organisms live even longer.

00:06:45.902 --> 00:06:49.304
This is a black coral called Leiopathes,
an image taken by my colleague,

00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:52.590
Brendan Roark, about 500
meters below Hawaii.

00:06:52.614 --> 00:06:54.657
Four thousand years is a long time.

00:06:54.962 --> 00:06:58.097
If you take a branch from one
of these corals and polish it up,

00:06:58.121 --> 00:07:00.414
this is about 100 microns across.
