00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.047
Carbon dioxide [levels] were very
much lower than they are today.

00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:33.715
So the earth was probably about three
to five degrees colder overall,

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.559
and much, much colder
in the polar regions.

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:39.362
What I'm trying to understand,

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:42.188
and what other colleagues of mine
are trying to understand,

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:44.671
is how we moved from that
cold climate condition

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.591
to the warm climate condition
that we enjoy today.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.674
We know from ice core research

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:52.778
that the transition from these
cold conditions to warm conditions

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:57.550
wasn't smooth, as you might predict
from the slow increase in solar radiation.

00:01:58.153 --> 00:02:01.384
And we know this from ice cores,
because if you drill down into ice,
