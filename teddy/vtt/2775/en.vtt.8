00:03:58.294 --> 00:04:01.288
so it's not always a lot of fun,
but overall it is.

00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:03.898
So we've got to become
a really good mapper to do this.

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:07.661
You don't see that kind of spectacular
coral abundance everywhere.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.725
It is global and it is deep,

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.063
but we need to really find
the right places.

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:16.253
We just saw a global map,
and overlaid was our cruise passage

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:17.482
from last year.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.386
This was a seven-week cruise,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.434
and this is us, having made our own maps

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:25.529
of about 75,000 square kilometers
of the seafloor in seven weeks,

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:28.075
but that's only a tiny fraction
of the seafloor.

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.868
We're traveling from west to east,

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:33.392
over part of the ocean that would
look featureless on a big-scale map,
