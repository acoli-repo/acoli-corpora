00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:31.961
So I want to leave you
with this last slide.

00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:35.908
It's just a still taken out of that first
piece of footage that I showed you.

00:10:35.932 --> 00:10:38.044
This is a spectacular coral garden.

00:10:38.068 --> 00:10:40.626
We didn't even expect
to find things this beautiful.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.534
It's thousands of meters deep.

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:43.932
There are new species.

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:46.315
It's just a beautiful place.

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:47.720
There are fossils in amongst,

00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:50.435
and now I've trained you
to appreciate the fossil corals

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.674
that are down there.

00:10:51.698 --> 00:10:54.564
So next time you're lucky enough
to fly over the ocean

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:55.997
or sail over the ocean,

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:58.688
just think -- there are massive
sea mountains down there

00:10:58.712 --> 00:11:00.579
that nobody's ever seen before,
