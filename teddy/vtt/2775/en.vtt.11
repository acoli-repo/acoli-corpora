00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:31.065
This is a swimming holothurian --
it's a small sea slug, basically.

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.276
This is slowed down.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.689
Most of the footage I'm showing
you is speeded up,

00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:36.641
because all of this takes a lot of time.

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:40.413
This is a beautiful holothurian as well.

00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:43.969
And this animal you're going to see
coming up was a big surprise.

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:47.405
I've never seen anything like this
and it took us all a bit surprised.

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.017
This was after about 15 hours of work
and we were all a bit trigger-happy,

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:53.778
and suddenly this giant
sea monster started rolling past.

00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:56.908
It's called a pyrosome
or colonial tunicate, if you like.

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.719
This wasn't what we were looking for.

00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:01.389
We were looking for corals,
deep sea corals.
