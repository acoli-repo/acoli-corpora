00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:01.389
We were looking for corals,
deep sea corals.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.492
You're going to see a picture
of one in a moment.

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:07.151
It's small, about five centimeters high.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:10.493
It's made of calcium carbonate,
so you can see its tentacles there,

00:06:10.517 --> 00:06:12.648
moving in the ocean currents.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.291
An organism like this probably lives
for about a hundred years.

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:19.855
And as it grows, it takes in
chemicals from the ocean.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.085
And the chemicals,
or the amount of chemicals,

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:24.783
depends on the temperature;
it depends on the pH,

00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:26.353
it depends on the nutrients.

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:29.611
And if we can understand how
these chemicals get into the skeleton,

00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:32.133
we can then go back,
collect fossil specimens,
