00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:01.004
is really one of the strongest
currents in the world

00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:03.235
coming through here,
flowing from west to east.

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.608
It's very turbulently mixed,

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:07.504
because it's moving over those
great big undersea mountains,

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:12.009
and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange
with the atmosphere in and out.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:15.540
And essentially, the oceans are breathing
through the Southern Ocean.

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:22.329
We've collected corals from back and forth
across this Antarctic passage,

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:25.380
and we've found quite a surprising thing
from my uranium dating:

00:09:25.404 --> 00:09:27.907
the corals migrated from south to north

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:31.060
during this transition from the glacial
to the interglacial.
