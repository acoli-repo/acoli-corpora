00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.010
a research-grade vehicle.

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:02.516
You can see an array
of big lights on the top.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.595
There are high-definition cameras,
manipulator arms,

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:08.532
and lots of little boxes and things
to put your samples.

00:05:09.087 --> 00:05:12.805
Here we are on our first dive
of this particular cruise,

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.535
plunging down into the ocean.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.432
We go pretty fast to make sure
the remotely operated vehicles

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.179
are not affected by any other ships.

00:05:19.203 --> 00:05:20.401
And we go down,

00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:22.599
and these are the kinds of things you see.

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:26.123
These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.

00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:31.065
This is a swimming holothurian --
it's a small sea slug, basically.
