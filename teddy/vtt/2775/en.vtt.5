It was different in the two polar regions,

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.594
and CO2 also increased in jumps.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:37.854
So we're pretty sure the ocean
has a lot to do with this.

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:40.244
The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,

00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:42.822
about 60 times more
than is in the atmosphere.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:46.048
It also acts to transport heat
across the equator,

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:49.841
and the ocean is full of nutrients
and it controls primary productivity.

00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:53.126
So if we want to find out
what's going on down in the deep sea,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.743
we really need to get down there,

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:55.933
see what's there

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:57.361
and start to explore.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:00.392
