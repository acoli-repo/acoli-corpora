00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:32.036
and that tells us exactly
how old the fossils are.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:34.934
This beautiful animation
of the Southern Ocean

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.093
I'm just going to use illustrate
how we're using these corals

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:42.188
to get at some of the ancient
ocean feedbacks.

00:08:42.212 --> 00:08:44.638
You can see the density
of the surface water

00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:47.060
in this animation by Ryan Abernathey.

00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:49.518
It's just one year of data,

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:52.152
but you can see how dynamic
the Southern Ocean is.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.907
The intense mixing,
particularly the Drake Passage,

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:58.368
which is shown by the box,

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:01.004
is really one of the strongest
currents in the world
