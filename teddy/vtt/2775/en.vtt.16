00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:00.488
On the right-hand side,

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.612
we've taken that same piece of coral,
put it in a nuclear reactor,

00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:04.788
induced fission,

00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:06.443
and every time there's some decay,

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:08.449
you can see that marked out in the coral,

00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:10.362
so we can see the uranium distribution.

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:11.537
Why are we doing this?

00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:13.848
Uranium is a very poorly regarded element,

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:15.031
but I love it.

00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:18.267
The decay helps us find out
about the rates and dates

00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.830
of what's going on in the ocean.

00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:21.752
And if you remember from the beginning,

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:24.789
that's what we want to get at
when we're thinking about climate.

00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:26.564
So we use a laser to analyze uranium

00:08:26.588 --> 00:08:29.373
and one of its daughter products,
thorium, in these corals,

00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:32.036
and that tells us exactly
how old the fossils are.
