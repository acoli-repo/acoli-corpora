Locusts are similar to shrimp.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.864
Crickets, some people say,
have an aroma of popcorn.

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:38.587
Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact

00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:40.365
than livestock farms do

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.361
because insects emit
far less greenhouse gas

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.288
and use up less space, water, and food.

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:48.511
Socioeconomically, bug production

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.641
could uplift people
in developing countries

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.099
since insect farms can be small scale,

00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:57.049
highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep.

00:03:57.073 --> 00:04:00.529
Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock
