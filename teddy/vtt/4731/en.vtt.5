00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:30.657
In fact, scientists say entomophagy
could be a cost-effective solution

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.503
for developing countries
that are food insecure.

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.466
Insects can contain up to 80% protein,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.313
the body's vital building blocks,

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.856
and are also high in energy-rich fat,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.264
fiber, and micronutrients
like vitamins and minerals.

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:47.228
Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:50.223
or even more mineral iron than beef,

00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:54.670
making them a huge, untapped resource
when you consider that iron deficiency

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:58.398
is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world?

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.555
The mealworm
is another nutritious example.
