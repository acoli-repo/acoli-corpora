00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.333
Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent.

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:04.646
And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.084
attitudes changed,

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:09.530
rippling outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world.

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:10.839
As farming took off,

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:13.940
people might have spurned
bugs as mere pests

00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.508
that destroyed their crops.

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:18.367
Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized,

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.168
weakening connections
with our foraging past.

00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:23.627
People simply forgot
their bug-rich history.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.663
Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy,

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:28.256
bugs are just an irritant.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.216
They sting and bite and infest our food.
