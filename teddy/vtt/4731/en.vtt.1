00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:31.507
As we evolved and bugs
became part of our dietary tradition,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.368
they fulfilled the role
of both staple food and delicacy.

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:39.250
In ancient Greece, cicadas
were considered luxury snacks.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.016
And even the Romans found
beetle larvae to be scrumptious.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.125
Why have we lost our taste for bugs?

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.971
The reason for our rejection
is historical,

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:49.541
and the story probably begins

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.773
around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent,

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:54.248
a place in the Middle East

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.757
that was a major birthplace
of agriculture.

00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.333
Back then, our once-nomadic ancestors
began to settle in the Crescent.
