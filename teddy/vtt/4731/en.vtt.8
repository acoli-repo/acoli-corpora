Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:02.735
and can be reared on organic waste,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.108
like vegetable peelings,

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:06.998
that might otherwise
just end up rotting in landfills.

00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:08.640
Feeling hungry yet?

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:12.777
Faced with a plate of fried crickets,
most people today would still recoil,

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:16.774
imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.028
But think of a lobster.

00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:22.383
It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers galore

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.587
that was once regarded
as an inferior, repulsive food.

00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:27.596
Now, lobster is a delicacy.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.392
Can the same paradigm shift
happen for bugs?
