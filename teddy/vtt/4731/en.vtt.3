They sting and bite and infest our food.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.692
We feel an "ick factor"
associated with them

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:37.118
and are disgusted
by the prospect of cooking insects.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:40.441
Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food,

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.542
forming a big part of everyday diets

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.334
for two billion people around the world.

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:48.386

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:57.870
that make them easy to harvest.

00:01:58.124 --> 00:01:59.855
Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.320
where huge tarantulas are gathered,
