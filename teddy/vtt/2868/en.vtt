00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:05.342
(Music)

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.151
Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.894
but ...

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.202
we can see you really clearly --

00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:13.266
(Laughter)

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.763
So you have to dance with us.

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.193
And we have this, like,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.703
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do --

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:20.938
Betta Lemme: Really easy.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.779
SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.439
and you're going to do it with us.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.434
And you can also stand up.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:30.984
