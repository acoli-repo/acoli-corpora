00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:06.589
When I was 14,

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:10.781
my parents intended to marry me off
to a man of their choosing.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.660
I refused.

00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.366
That choice to defy my family
shaped everything in my life

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.330
and set me on the path
to become who I am today.

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:24.094
But it was very painful at times
and continues to be so.

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:29.289
My parents were raised in traditional,
uneducated Moroccan families

00:00:29.313 --> 00:00:33.564
where a girl's main value
is measured by her virginity.
