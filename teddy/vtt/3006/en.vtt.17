It's kind of "Las Vegas, baby," for me.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.381
(Laughter)

00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:35.079
We spend so many hours, so much resources,

00:08:35.103 --> 00:08:38.691
so much time trying to get
those compounds ready,

00:08:38.715 --> 00:08:40.759
and then we test them.

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:43.235
And most of the time, nothing happens.

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:44.970
Nothing at all.

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:46.488
But once in a while --

00:08:46.512 --> 00:08:48.063
just once in a while,

00:08:48.087 --> 00:08:52.349
we get that particular compound
that has absolutely amazing effects.

00:08:52.373 --> 00:08:53.671
That's the jackpot.

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:56.236
And when I'm saying that, actually,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.752
I should take out something
else from my pocket --

00:08:58.776 --> 00:09:00.395
be afraid, be very afraid.
