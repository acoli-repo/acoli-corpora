I can tell you those guys
actually are producing

00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:03.111
very, very interesting compounds.

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:06.324
And I'm going to tell you
more about that in a second,

00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:10.263
but first, I would like to tell you more
about this "we are looking into it."

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.490
How does one look into it?

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:17.592
Well, first of all, my students and I
have to capture a lot of spiders.

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:19.533
So how do we do that?

00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:21.740
Well, you'd be surprised.

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:25.705
Once one starts to look,
one finds a lot of spiders.

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:28.438
They actually live everywhere around us.

00:06:28.462 --> 00:06:29.850
Within a couple of hours,

00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:34.396
we are capable of catching maybe
two, three, four hundred spiders,
