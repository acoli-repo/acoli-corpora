00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:34.396
we are capable of catching maybe
two, three, four hundred spiders,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.958
and we bring them back to my laboratory,

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:40.373
and we house each of them
in its own individual home.

00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:42.832
And we give each of them a little meal.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:45.285
So now I know what you're thinking:

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:46.460
"This guy's nuts.

00:06:46.484 --> 00:06:48.310
He has a spider B&amp;B at work ..."

00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:50.310
(Laughter)

00:06:50.334 --> 00:06:52.179
No, no it's not exactly that,

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.312
and it's not the kind of venture
I would advise you to start.

00:06:57.184 --> 00:07:00.272
No, once we're done with that,
we wait a few days,
