00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:31.989
you could consider that 10 to 15
new kinds of antibiotics

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:34.417
would hit the market
every couple of years.

00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:38.260
Do you know how many of them
hit the market in the past five years?

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:39.672
Two.

00:10:39.696 --> 00:10:43.092
The reality is
that if we continue this way,

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:47.220
we are a few decades away
from being completely helpless

00:10:47.244 --> 00:10:49.203
in front of infections,

00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:53.106
just like we were before the discovery
of penicillin 90 years ago.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:56.772
So you see, the reality
is that we are at war

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:58.524
against an invisible enemy

00:10:58.548 --> 00:11:02.184
that adapts and evolves
a lot quicker than we do.
