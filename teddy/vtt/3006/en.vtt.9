00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:30.088
that are available to us,

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:33.793
that are produced by hundreds
of thousands of live creatures.

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.118
And --

00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:39.214
Oh, sorry, she just wants
to go for a little walk.

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:40.388
(Laughter)

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:44.636
Spiders alone are actually
thought to produce

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.799
over 10 million different
kinds of compounds

00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:51.263
with potential therapeutic application.

00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.437
10 million.

00:04:52.954 --> 00:04:56.480
And do you know how many scientists
actually have managed to study so far?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.118
About 0.01 percent.

00:04:59.915 --> 00:05:04.982
So that means that there is still
99.99 percent of all those compounds
