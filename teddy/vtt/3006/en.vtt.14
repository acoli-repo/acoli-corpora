No, once we're done with that,
we wait a few days,

00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:02.787
and then, we anesthetize those spiders.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.316
Once they're asleep, we run a tiny
little electric current through their body

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.729
and that contracts their venom glads.

00:07:10.753 --> 00:07:15.221
Then, under a microscope, we can see
a tiny little droplet of venom appearing.

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:18.913
So we take a hair-thin
glass tube, a capillary,

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.552
and we collect that tiny droplet.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:24.307
Then, we take the spider
and we put it back into its home,

00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:26.066
and we start again with another one.

00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:31.007
Because spiders are completely
unharmed during the process,
