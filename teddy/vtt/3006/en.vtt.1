She's far too leggy, she's far too hairy,

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.711
and she's far too big to ever be trusted.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:38.216
But to me, Sophie is a fantastic
feat of bioengineering.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.082
You see, Sophie is a testimony
to all those creatures

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:45.454
that have managed to survive
since the beginning of time;

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:49.399
all those animals
that have managed to have offspring

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:52.279
generation after generation,
until this day.

00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.953
You see, over one billion years ago,

00:00:55.977 --> 00:01:00.008
the first primitive cells
started to evolve on this planet.
