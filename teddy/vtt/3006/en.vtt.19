that are giving us so much trouble,

00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:32.781
that are often making media headlines.

00:09:33.455 --> 00:09:35.797

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:38.875
(Laughter)

00:09:39.804 --> 00:09:42.138
But that little spider,

00:09:42.162 --> 00:09:46.717

Multiply that by 365,

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:05.843
and you're reaching the staggering number
of 700,000 people dead every single year
