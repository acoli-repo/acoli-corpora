00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:31.007
Because spiders are completely
unharmed during the process,

00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:32.609
it means that a few days later,

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:36.111
once they've produced a little bit
of venom again and they've recovered,

00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:38.038
we can release them back into the wild.

00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:41.791
It takes literally hundreds of spiders

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:45.597
to just produce the equivalent
of one raindrop of venom.

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:49.551
So that drop is incredibly precious to us.

00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:52.101
And once we have it, we freeze it,

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:53.904
and we then pass it in a machine

00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:59.698
that will separate and purify every
chemical compound that is in that venom.

00:07:59.722 --> 00:08:01.464
We're speaking about tiny amounts.
