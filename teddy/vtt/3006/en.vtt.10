So that means that there is still
99.99 percent of all those compounds

00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:07.342
that are out there, completely unknown,

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:09.975
and are just waiting
to be harvested and tested,

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.213
which is fantastic.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:15.329
You see, so far, scientists
have concentrated their efforts

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:19.381
on very charismatic,
very dangerous animals --

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:23.053
vipers and cobras or scorpions
and black widows.

00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:28.374
But what about all those little bugs
that we actually have all around us?

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.575
You know, like that spider
that lives behind your couch?
