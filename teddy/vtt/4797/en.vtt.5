00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.467
it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling.

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.954
According to the National Institute
of Mental Health,

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.847
it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:41.138
over ten years to ask for help.

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:43.115
But there are very effective treatments.

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:47.611
Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals.

00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.631
In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy,

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.553
which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain,

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.668
is also very helpful.

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:56.989
Other promising treatments,

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.621
like transcranial magnetic stimulation,

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.799
are being investigated, too.
