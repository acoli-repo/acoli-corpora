00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:31.492
Almost everyone feels down
from time to time.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:32.711
Getting a bad grade,

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:33.808
losing a job,

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:34.831
having an argument,

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.064
even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness.

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:39.891
Sometimes there's no trigger at all.

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.006
It just pops up out of the blue.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.549
Then circumstances change,

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.206
and those sad feelings disappear.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.419
Clinical depression is different.

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:49.896
It's a medical disorder,

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:52.778
and it won't go away 
just because you want it to.

00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:55.180
It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.783
and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work,

00:00:58.783 --> 00:00:59.590
play,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.996
or love.
