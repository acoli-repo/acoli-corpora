It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait,

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:33.516
and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:36.866
anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm.

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:39.461
If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself,

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.804
avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:46.977
Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:49.599
can make them feel guilty for struggling.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.936
Even just talking about 
depression openly can help.

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:57.315
For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:59.814
actually reduces their suicide risk.

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:03.766
Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma
