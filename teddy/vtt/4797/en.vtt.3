00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:31.292
And it's not just behavioral symptoms.

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:35.406
Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain.

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:36.511
First of all,

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.092
there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.510
and X-ray vision.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.783
These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes.

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:46.871
On a more microscale,

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.351
depression is associated 
with a few things:

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.241
the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters,

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.870
especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.628
blunted circadian rhythms,

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:03.338
or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle,
