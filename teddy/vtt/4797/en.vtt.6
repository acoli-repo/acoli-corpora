00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.799
are being investigated, too.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.405
So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression,

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:08.777
encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options.

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:11.176
You might even offer to help
with specific tasks,

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.291
like looking up therapists in the area,

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.026
or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor.

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:17.689
To someone with depression,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.741
these first steps can seem insurmountable.

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.026
If they feel guilty or ashamed,

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.590
point out that depression 
is a medical condition,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.641
just like asthma or diabetes.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.274
It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait,
