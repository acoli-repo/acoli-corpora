00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:03.338
or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle,

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.303
and hormone abnormalities,

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:10.187
such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.950
But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.101
of what causes depression.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:20.075
It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment,

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:21.839
but we don't have a diagnostic tool

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:26.112
that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.619
And because depression symptoms
are intangible,

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.467
it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling.
