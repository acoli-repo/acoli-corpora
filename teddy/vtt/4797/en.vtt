Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.382
In the United States,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.683
close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.358
But because it's a mental illness,

00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:21.598
it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:25.390
One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.963
and just feeling depressed.

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:31.492
Almost everyone feels down
from time to time.
