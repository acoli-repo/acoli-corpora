00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.438
So then we come along,

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.524
we implant some mammalian cells
that you can see in blue.

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:35.756
What happens is,
these guys start multiplying

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.774
and they fill up this entire scaffold.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:40.222
As weird as this is,

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:44.931
it's actually really reminiscent
of how our own tissues are organized.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.208
And we found in our pre-clinical work

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.628
that you can implant
these scaffolds into the body,

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:52.335
and the body will send in cells
and a blood supply

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.574
and actually keep these things alive.

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:58.445
This is the point
when people started asking me,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.016
"Andrew, can you make
body parts out of apples?"
