This is just a place where people can come

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.446
and ask fascinating questions
and find answers.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.335
And I realized a long time ago

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.601
that if I challenge people
to build the equipment they need

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.738
out of the garbage I find,

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.525
it's a great way to foster creativity.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.700
And what happened

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:19.605
was that artists and scientists
from around the world

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.645
started coming to my lab.

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.878
And it's not just because
we value unconventional ideas,

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:27.220
it's because we test and validate them

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:28.671
with scientific rigor.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.521
So one day I was hacking something,
I was taking it apart,
