So one day I was hacking something,
I was taking it apart,

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.402
and I had this sudden idea:

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:38.865
Could I treat biology like hardware?

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.140
Could I dismantle a biological system,

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:42.587
mix and match the parts

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:45.565
and then put it back together
in some new and creative way?

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:48.030
My lab started working on this,

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:49.947
and I want to show you the result.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.291
Can any of you guys
tell me what fruit this is?

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:56.429
Audience: Apple!

00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.610
Andrew Pelling:
That's right -- it's an apple.

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.643
Now, I actually want you to notice as well
