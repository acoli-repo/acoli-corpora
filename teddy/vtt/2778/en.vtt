00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.556
I've got a confession.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.138
I love looking through people's garbage.

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:07.717
Now, it's not some creepy thing.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.907
I'm usually just looking
for old electronics,

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.357
stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.020
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:18.653
Each one's got three different motors,

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:20.614
so now you can build things that move.

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:23.353
There's switches so you can
turn things on and off.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.235
There's even a freaking laser,

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.035
so you can make a cool robot
into an awesome robot.
