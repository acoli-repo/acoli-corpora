00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.316
Yeah, I know.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.373
(Laughter)

00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:35.115
It's a good lab, man.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.600
(Laughter)

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:38.331
And then we grew cells on them.

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.393
And this is the result.

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:46.349
Listen, my lab is not
in the ear-manufacturing business.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:51.114
People have actually been working
on this for decades.

00:03:51.138 --> 00:03:52.786
Here's the issue:

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.216
commercial scaffolds can be
really expensive and problematic,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.841
because they're sourced
from proprietary products,

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.968
animals or cadavers.
