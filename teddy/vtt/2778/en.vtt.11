00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:31.981
then maybe we can use asparagus
to form new connections

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.862
between the ends of damaged
and severed nerves.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.430
Or maybe even a spinal cord.

00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:39.412
Don't get me wrong --

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:41.440
this is exceptionally challenging

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:43.059
and really hard work to do,

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.701
and we are not the only ones
working on this.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:49.056
But we are the only ones using asparagus.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.587
(Laughter)

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.178
Right now, we've got
really promising pilot data.

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:57.085
And we're working with tissue engineers

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.275
and neurosurgeons

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:00.195
to find out what's actually possible.
