Now, I actually want you to notice as well

00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:03.461
that this is a lot redder
than most apples.

00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:07.020
And that's because
we grew human cells into it.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:11.222
We took a totally innocent
Macintosh apple,

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.265
removed all the apple cells and DNA

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.308
and then implanted human cells.

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:19.381
And what we're left with
after removing all the apple cells

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.146
is this cellulose scaffold.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.307
This is the stuff that gives plants
their shape and texture.

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.303
And these little holes that you can see,

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:28.728
this is where all
the apple cells used to be.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.438
So then we come along,
