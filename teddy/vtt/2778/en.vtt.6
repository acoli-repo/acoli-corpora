00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.016
"Andrew, can you make
body parts out of apples?"

00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:06.025
And I'm like, "You've come
to the right place."

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.326
(Laughter)

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.900
I actually brought this up with my wife.

00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:11.658
She's a musical instrument maker,

00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:13.995
and she does a lot
of wood carving for a living.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.260
So I asked her,

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:20.102
"Could you, like,
literally carve some ears

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:21.658
out of an apple for us?"

00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:23.133
And she did.

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:25.929
So I took her ears to the lab.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.706
We then started preparing them.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.316
Yeah, I know.
