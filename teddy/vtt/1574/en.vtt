I love trees, and I'm very lucky,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because we live near a wonderful arboretum,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now, with my four-year-old,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second school I was at had big trees too,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
around it, around the playing fields.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
