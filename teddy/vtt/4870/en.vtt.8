00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:02.643
it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:06.682
Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4,

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:09.433
we can subtract that from 10 to get 6.

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:12.653
Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place:

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:13.654
6 zeroes,

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:14.656
2 ones,

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:15.641
1 two,

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.749
0 threes,

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:17.854
0 fours,

00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:18.996
0 fives,

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.196
1 six,

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:21.365
0 sevens,

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:22.597
0 eights,

00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:24.903
and 0 nines.

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.183
The safe swings open, 
and inside you find...

00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:31.304
Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.
