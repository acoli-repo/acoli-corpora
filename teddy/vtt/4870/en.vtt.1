00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.391
There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common:

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.465
they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers.

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:39.979
This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.725
Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.527
indicates how many times

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:49.257
the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.210
The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.161
the second digit indicates 
the number of ones,

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.155
the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end.

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.080
The last lock takes a 10 digit number,
