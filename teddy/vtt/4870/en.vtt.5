00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:30.398
which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater.

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:34.392
Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes,

00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:40.477
every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs.

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:43.968
If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one –

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:47.191
and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum –

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:51.561
we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence,

00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.979
including that leading digit.

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.296
For example, 
if we try this with the first code,

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.621
we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits.
