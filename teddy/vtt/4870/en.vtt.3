00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.710
By adding all the digits in 1210 together,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.400
we get 4 – the total number of digits.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.462
This makes sense 
since each individual digit

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:41.876
tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.795
So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.054
must add up to ten.

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:49.453
This tells us another important thing –

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.336
the number can’t have 
too many large digits.

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:53.498
For example,

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:55.119
if it included a 6 and a 7,

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.758
then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times,

00:01:57.758 --> 00:01:59.764
and another digit 7 times–

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.115
making more than 10 digits.
