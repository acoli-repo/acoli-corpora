00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.621
we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits.

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:02.775
Now, if we subtract one,

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:07.762
we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit –

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.857
two, in our example.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.701
Why go through all that?

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.322
Well, we now know something important:

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:19.465
the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.598
is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one.

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.701
And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.043
than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together?
