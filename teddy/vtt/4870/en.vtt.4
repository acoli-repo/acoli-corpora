00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.115
making more than 10 digits.

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:04.741
We can conclude 
that there can be no more

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.573
than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence.

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.404
So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9,

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.646
only one – if any-- will make the cut.

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.641
And there will be zeroes in the positions

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.524
corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:25.697
So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes –

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:30.398
which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater.
