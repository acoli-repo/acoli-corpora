00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.043
than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together?

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.538
The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2,

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.274
and the rest 1s.

00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:38.590
How many 1s?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.543
Turns out there can only be two –

00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:45.536
any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:50.460
So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.479
a 2 counting the 1s,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.229
and two 1s –

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.499
one to count the 2s

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.969
and another to count the leading digit.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.402
And speaking of that,

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:02.643
it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is.
