00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.631
"Of course context is important."

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:05.894

with vast disparities in health and wealth
and income and education.

If we assume that our engineers
and inventors already know enough

00:07:15.864 --> 00:07:18.450

don't necessarily know enough about it,
