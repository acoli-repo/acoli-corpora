Another inventor, Tendekayi Katsiga,

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:08.327
was working for an NGO in Botswana
that manufactured hearing aids.

00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:13.835
Now, he noticed that
these hearing aids needed batteries

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.056
that needed replacement,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.714
very often at a cost
that was not affordable

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:19.840
for most of the users that he knew.

00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:25.240
In response, and being an engineer,
Tendekayi invented

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:28.874
a solar-powered battery charger
with rechargeable batteries,

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.217
that could be used in these hearing aids.
