through a horn.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:04.660
Now, this approach has been around
for more than a century.

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:09.169
It's very much dependent on the skill
and the experience of the midwife.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.333
Two young inventors from Uganda

00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:17.889
visited an antenatal clinic
at a local hospital a few years ago,

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.745
when they were students
in information technology.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:24.093
They noticed that quite often,

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.201
the midwife was not able
to hear any heart rate

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:29.913
when trying to listen to it
through this horn.
