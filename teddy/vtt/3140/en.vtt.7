00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:31.954
Now, the inventors that I've mentioned

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.657
integrated engineering with healthcare.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.495
This is what biomedical engineers do.

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.463
At the University of Cape Town,

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.644
we run a course called
Health Innovation and Design.

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:47.615
It's taken by many of our graduate
students in biomedical engineering.

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:51.703
The aim of the course
is to introduce these students

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:54.282
to the philosophy of the design world.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:57.327
The students are encouraged
to engage with communities

00:03:57.351 --> 00:04:00.594
as they search for solutions
to health-related problems.
