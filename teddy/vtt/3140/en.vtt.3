So they invented their own
fetal heart rate monitor.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:40.755
They adapted the horn
and connected it to a smartphone.

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:45.272
An app on the smartphone
records the heart rate, analyzes it

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:48.200
and provides the midwife
with a range of information

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:49.979
on the status of the baby.

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:52.841
These inventors --

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.087
(Applause)

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.214
are called Aaron Tushabe
and Joshua Okello.

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.954
