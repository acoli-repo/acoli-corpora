00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:03.040
This is an equipment graveyard.

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:05.292
It's a typical final resting place

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:08.102
for medical equipment
from hospitals in Africa.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.135
Now, why is this?

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.828
Most of the medical devices
used in Africa are imported,

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:18.496
and quite often, they're not suitable
for local conditions.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.345
They may require trained staff

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.024
that aren't available to operate
and maintain and repair them;

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.508
they may not be able to withstand
high temperatures and humidity;
