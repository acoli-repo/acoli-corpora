For example, their homes
and their community center

00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:03.459
were filled with echoes
that interfered with their hearing.

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:09.107
So instead of developing and designing
a new and better hearing aid,

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.814
the students did an audit
of the environment,

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:14.237
with a view to improving the acoustics.

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:19.030
They also devised a campaign
to raise awareness of hearing loss

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:22.630
and to counter the stigma
attached to wearing a hearing aid.

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:26.987
Now, this often happens
when one pays attention to the user --

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.661
in this case, the elderly --

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:30.650
and their needs and their context.
