When a client would reject a product,

00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:02.988
it was common at his company

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:06.720
to proclaim that the client
just didn't know what they wanted.

00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:10.946
Having completed the course,
the student fed back to us

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.168
that he now realized
that it was he who hadn't understood

00:06:14.192 --> 00:06:15.613
what the client wanted.

00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:18.827
Another student gave us feedback

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:21.319
that she had learned
to design with empathy,

00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:24.333
as opposed to designing for functionality,

00:06:24.357 --> 00:06:27.088
which is what her engineering
education had taught her.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.962
So what all of this illustrates is that
we're often blinded to real needs
