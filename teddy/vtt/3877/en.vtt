00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.395
When we think about mapping cities,

00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:05.200
we tend to think about roads
and streets and buildings,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000
and the settlement narrative
that led to their creation,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.984
or you might think about
the bold vision of an urban designer,

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:13.487
but there's other ways
to think about mapping cities

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:15.653
and how they got to be made.

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:17.746
Today, I want to show you
a new kind of map.

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.242
This is not a geographic map.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.373
This is a map of the relationships 
between people in my hometown

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:23.713
of Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:28.130
and what you can see here is that
each dot represents a person,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.424
each line represents a relationship
between those people,
