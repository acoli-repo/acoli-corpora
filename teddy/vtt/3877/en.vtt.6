00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.350
TEDxRio is down in the lower right,
right next to bloggers and writers.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.059
But then you also have this
tremendous diversity of people

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.333
that are interested
in different kinds of music.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.537
Even Justin Bieber fans
are represented here.

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:13.429
Other boy bands, country singers,

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.337
gospel music, funk and rap
and stand-up comedy,

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:19.376
and there's even a whole section
around drugs and jokes.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:20.862
How cool is that?

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:23.996
And then the Flamengo football team
is also represented here.

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.156
So you have that same kind of spread

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:28.871
of sports and civics
and the arts and music,

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.032
but it's represented
in a very different way,
