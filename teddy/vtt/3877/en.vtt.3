Michael Phelps, the Olympian.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.824
Under Armour, you may have heard of,
is a Baltimore company,

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:36.257
and that community of sports
acts as the only bridge

00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:38.528
between these two ends of the network.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:40.423

00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:52.892
but you also have this
very predominant group

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:57.285
of geeks and techies that are sort of
taking over the top half of the network,

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.787
and there's even a group
that's so distinct and clear

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:02.137
that we can identify it
as Twitter employees,
