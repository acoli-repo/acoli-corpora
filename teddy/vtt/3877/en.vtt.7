00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.032
but it's represented
in a very different way,

00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:34.352
and I think that maybe fits
with our understanding of Rio

00:03:34.352 --> 00:03:38.366
as being a very multicultural,
musically diverse city.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:41.984
So we have all this data.

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:45.102
It's an incredibly rich set of data
that we have about cities now,

00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:48.348
maybe even richer than any data set
that we've ever had before.

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.272
So what can we do with it?

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:53.142
Well, I think the first thing
that we can try to understand

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.480
is that segregation is a social construct.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.824
It's something that we choose to do,
and we could choose not to do it,

00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:00.756
and if you kind of think about it,
