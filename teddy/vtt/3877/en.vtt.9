00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:31.524
So if we're trying to use diversity

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:34.605
as a way to tackle some of our
more intractable problems,

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.899
we need to start to think 
about diversity in a new way.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.426
And lastly, we have the ability to create

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:44.520
interventions to start to reshape
our cities in a new way,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.120
and I believe that if
we have that capability,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.185
we may even bear some
responsibility to do so.

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:51.950
So what is a city?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.156
I think some might say that it is

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:57.316
a geographical area or a collection
of streets and buildings,

00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:00.068
but I believe that a city 
is the sum of the relationships
