00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.014
because it seems as though
we're living in a very small town.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.048
We see the same people
over and over again,

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.219
but that's because
we're not really exploring

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.081
the full depth and breadth of the city.

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.833
On the other end of the network,

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.770
you have folks who are interested
in things like hip-hop music

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.574
and they even identify with living
in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area

00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:20.990
over, say, the Baltimore city
designation proper.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.090
But in the middle, you see that there's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.573
something that connects
the two communities together,

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:26.452
and that's sports.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:29.540
We have the Baltimore Orioles,
the Baltimore Ravens football team,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.986
Michael Phelps, the Olympian.
