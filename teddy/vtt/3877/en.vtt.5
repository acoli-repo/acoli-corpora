the arts community, the music community.

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:32.070
And so it leads to things like this.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.043

00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:34.867
Somebody sent me this photo
a few weeks ago,

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.774
and it shows what is happening
on the ground in San Francisco,

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:40.158
and I think you can
actually try to understand that

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:41.860
through looking at a map like this.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.620
Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.074
I spent the last few weeks
gathering data about Rio,

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.881
and one of the things
that stood out to me about this city

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.003
is that everything's
really kind of mixed up.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:55.107
It's a very heterogenous city in a way 
that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.562
You still have the lobe of people involved

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.946
with government, newspapers,
politics, columnists.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.350
TEDxRio is down in the lower right,
right next to bloggers and writers.
