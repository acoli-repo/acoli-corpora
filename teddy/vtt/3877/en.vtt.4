00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:02.137
that we can identify it
as Twitter employees,

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:05.504
next to the geeks, in between
the gamers and the geeks,

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:08.445
at the opposite end
of the hip-hop spectrum.

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:10.162
So you can see, though,

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.843
that the tensions that we've
heard about in San Francisco

00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:15.764
in terms of people being
concerned about gentrification

00:02:15.764 --> 00:02:18.523
and all the new tech companies
that are bringing new wealth

00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:20.620
and settlement into the city are real,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.849
and you can actually see
that documented here.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.869
You can see the LGBT community

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.165
is not really getting along
with the geek community that well,

00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:30.297
the arts community, the music community.
