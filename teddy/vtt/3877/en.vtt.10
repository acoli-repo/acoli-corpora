00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:00.068
but I believe that a city 
is the sum of the relationships

00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:01.629
of the people that live there,

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:07.680
and I believe that if we can start to
document those relationships in a real way

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.413
then maybe we have a real shot

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:12.088
at creating those kinds of cities
that we'd like to have.

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:13.445
Thank you.

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.749
