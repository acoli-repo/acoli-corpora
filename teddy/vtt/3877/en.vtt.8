00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:00.756
and if you kind of think about it,

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:04.167
what we're doing with this data
is aiming a space telescope at a city

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:07.199
and looking at it as if was
a giant high school cafeteria,

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.937
and seeing how everybody arranged
themselves in a seating chart.

00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:14.250
Well maybe it's time to shake up
the seating chart a little bit.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.790
The other thing that we start to realize

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.428
is that race is a really
poor proxy for diversity.

00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:22.365
We've got people represented
from all different types of races

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:24.691
across the entire map here --

00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:27.067
only looking at race

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.785
doesn't really contribute to
our development of diversity.

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:31.524
So if we're trying to use diversity
