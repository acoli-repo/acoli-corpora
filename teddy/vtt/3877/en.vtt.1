00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.424
each line represents a relationship
between those people,

00:00:31.424 --> 00:00:34.870
and each color represents a community
within the network.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.732
Now, I'm here on the green side,
down on the far right where the geeks are,

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:43.580
and TEDx also is down 
on the far right. (Laughter)

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.157
Now, on the other side of the network,

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:49.117
you tend to have primarily
African-American and Latino folks

00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:52.707
who are really concerned about somewhat
different things than the geeks are,

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.148
but just to give some sense,

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.554
the green part of the network 
we call Smalltimore,

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:58.099
for those of us that inhabit it,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.014
because it seems as though
we're living in a very small town.
