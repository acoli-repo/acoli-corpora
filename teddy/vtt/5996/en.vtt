00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.413
And the clock starts...

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:09.954
now.

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.288
Did you miss it?

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.329
It wasn’t some bug buzzing by 
or a weird trick of the light.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.913
You just saw a hummingbird perform
astonishing aerial acrobatics,

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:26.788
eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,
and then escape a threat upside down—

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.954
all in a matter of seconds.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:34.996
So let’s slow down the action, and unpack
each step in this blazing-fast feast.
