You know what's a lot harder
than it seems like it should be?

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:06.335
Actually feeling alive.

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:11.507
And what I mean by that
is that we are all constantly doing,

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.760
or, at least, we're constantly scrolling.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.179
But we're not necessarily living.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.891
You know, we keep ourselves busy
to the point of exhaustion,

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:21.642
but we're also languishing.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.062
We feel a little bid dead inside.

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:25.980
And I think we know that, on some level.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:27.648
I think that's part of the reason

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.318
we keep ourselves so busy
and distracted to begin with.
