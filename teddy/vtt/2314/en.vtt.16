00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.478
There are many, many mathematically
consistent sets of laws.

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.917
Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.649
So this is a problem, believe it or not,

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:09.647
that reflective physicists really think a lot about,

00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:12.755
and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:14.970
say, well, maybe the set of laws

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.217
that describes our universe,

00:08:16.217 --> 00:08:17.952
it's just one set of laws

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:19.988
and it describes one part of reality,

00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:22.784
but maybe every consistent set of laws

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:24.570
describes another part of reality,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.503
and in fact all possible physical worlds

00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:30.954
really exist, they're all out there.
