00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.975
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.420
a little nugget of false vacuum

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.393
can fluctuate into existence,

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:08.375
and then, by the miracle of inflation,

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:11.460
blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.215
we see around us.

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:16.769
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.537
It's very speculative. It's fascinating.

00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:21.865
But I've got a big problem with it,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.750
and the problem is this:

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.221
It's a pseudo-religious point of view.

00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.217
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,

00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.965
but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:34.734
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.
