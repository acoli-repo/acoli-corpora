Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.244
and the most fundamental science is physics.

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:06.214
That tells us what naked reality really is,

00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:08.840
that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.830
the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.482
So maybe physics can fill this blank,

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:19.544
and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,

00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:23.207
physicists have purported to give

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:26.327
a purely scientific explanation of how

00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:29.322
a universe like ours could have popped into existence

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:31.201
out of sheer nothingness,
