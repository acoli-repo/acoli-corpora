00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:31.201
out of sheer nothingness,

00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:34.281
a quantum fluctuation out of the void.

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.339
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.645
more recently Alex Vilenkin,

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.378
and the whole thing has been popularized

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:42.571
by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.103
Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:47.229
"A Universe from Nothing,"

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.445
and Lawrence thinks that he's given —

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:51.526
he's a militant atheist, by the way,

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.150
so he's gotten God out of the picture.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.531
The laws of quantum field theory,

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:57.432
the state-of-the-art physics, can show how

00:05:57.432 --> 00:05:58.750
out of sheer nothingness,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.975
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,
