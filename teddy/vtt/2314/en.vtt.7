00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.102
and I hope you don't, because
it's not a good argument.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:34.263
So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:37.413
he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:39.843
but where did I come from?

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:42.013
(Laughter)

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.432
Whence then am I?

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.640
God speaks in a more formal English.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.629
(Laughter)

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.677
And so one theory is that God was so bored with

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:53.466
pondering the puzzle of His own existence

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.388
that He created the world just to distract himself.

00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:58.500
But anyway, let's forget about God.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.857
Take God out of the equation: We have

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.980
________ + nothing = the world.
