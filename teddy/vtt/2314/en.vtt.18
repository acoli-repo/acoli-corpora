Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,

00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:06.708
who believes that all mathematical structures exist,

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:08.845
and mathematical existence is the same thing

00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:10.612
as physical existence,

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:12.930
so we have this vastly rich multiverse

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.371
that encompasses every logical possibility.

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:19.881
Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,

00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:22.153
these physicists and also philosophers are actually

00:09:22.153 --> 00:09:24.675
reaching back to a very old idea

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:26.132
that goes back to Plato.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.330
It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.243
or the great chain of being,
