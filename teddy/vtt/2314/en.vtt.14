00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:00.407
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:01.612
in the world.

00:07:01.612 --> 00:07:03.985
They don't exist outside the world.

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:05.965
They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.960
They can't call a world into existence

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.278
out of nothingness.

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:10.809
That's a very primitive view

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.993
of what a scientific law is.

00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:14.988
And if you don't believe me on this,

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:16.790
listen to Stephen Hawking,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.825
who himself put forward a model of the cosmos

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:21.901
that was self-contained,

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:25.539
didn't require any outside cause, any creator,

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.267
and after proposing this,

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:29.681
Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:32.993
He said, this model is just equations.
