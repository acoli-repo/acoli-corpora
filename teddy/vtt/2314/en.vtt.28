00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:00.560
the question, "Why does the world exist?"

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.239
that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:03.693
with a more intimate question:

00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.776
Why do I exist? Why do you exist?

00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:10.376
you know, our existence would
seem to be amazingly improbable,

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:14.695
because there's an enormous number
of genetically possible humans,

00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:16.099
if you can compute it by looking at

00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:18.441
the number of the genes and the
number of alleles and so forth,

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.737
and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:22.892
there are about 10 to the 10,000th

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.552
possible humans, genetically.

00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:28.020
That's between a googol and a googolplex.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.636
And the number of the actual
humans that have existed

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:32.130
is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,
