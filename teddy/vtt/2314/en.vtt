00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.001
Why does the universe exist?

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.996
Why is there â€” Okay. Okay. (Laughter)

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.838
This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:13.414
Why is there a world, why are we in it,

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.293
and why is there something rather than nothing at all?

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:19.939
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.174
So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:23.730
the puzzle of existence,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.644
where we are now in addressing it,

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:28.894
and why you should care,

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.810
and I hope you do care.
