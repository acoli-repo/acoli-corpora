00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.804
So it's God + nothing = the world.

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:07.118
Okay? Now that's the equation.

00:03:07.118 --> 00:03:08.851
And so maybe you don't believe in God.

00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:10.681
Maybe you're a scientific atheist

00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:14.015
or an unscientific atheist,
and you don't believe in God,

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:15.433
and you're not happy with it.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.137
By the way, even if we have this equation,

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.039
God + nothing = the world,

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.725
there's already a problem:

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.759
Why does God exist?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.962
God doesn't exist by logic alone

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.775
unless you believe the ontological argument,

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.102
and I hope you don't, because
it's not a good argument.
