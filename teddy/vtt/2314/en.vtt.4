00:01:56.052 --> 00:02:00.274
So this question, why is there
something rather than nothing,

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:02.242
this sublime question, was posed rather late

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:04.552
in intellectual history.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:07.031
It was towards the end of the 17th century,

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.993
the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,

00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:11.736
a very smart guy, Leibniz,

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.886
who invented the calculus

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.740
independently of Isaac Newton,
at about the same time,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.342
but for Leibniz, who asked why is
there something rather than nothing,

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:21.535
this was not a great mystery.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:23.931
He either was or pretended to be

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.687
an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:29.702
and he said it's obvious why the world exists:

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.164
because God created it.
