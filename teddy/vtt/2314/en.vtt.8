00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.980
________ + nothing = the world.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.761
Now, if you're a Buddhist,

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.505
you might want to stop right there,

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:08.474
because essentially what you've got is

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.050
nothing = the world,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.563
and by symmetry of identity, that means

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:13.918
the world = nothing. Okay?

00:04:13.918 --> 00:04:16.337
And to a Buddhist, the world
is just a whole lot of nothing.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:19.443
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.

00:04:19.443 --> 00:04:21.995
And we think there's a lot of something out there

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.560
but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.271
If we let our desires melt away,

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.151
we'll see the world for what it truly is,
