00:10:57.135 --> 00:11:01.138
It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)

00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:03.881
And then there's the best of all possible worlds

00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.471
in an ethical sense.

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:06.650
You should get solemn now,

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.845
because a world in which sentient beings

00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:11.465
don't suffer needlessly,

00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:13.334
in which there aren't things like

00:11:13.334 --> 00:11:15.549
childhood cancer or the Holocaust.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.800
This is an ethical conception.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.865
Anyway, so between nothingness

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:20.498
and the fullest possible reality,

00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:22.043
various special realities.

00:11:22.043 --> 00:11:24.323
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.

00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:27.833
Then there's the most elegant possible reality.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.197
That's special.

00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:31.849
The fullest possible reality, that's special.
