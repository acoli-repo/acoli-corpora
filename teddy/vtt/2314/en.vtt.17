00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:30.954
really exist, they're all out there.

00:08:30.954 --> 00:08:33.237
We just see a little tiny part of reality

00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:35.780
that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.512
but there are many, many other worlds,

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:39.278
parts of reality that are described

00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:41.235
by vastly different theories

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.251
that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,

00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:47.996
that are inconceivably exotic.

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:49.733
Steven Weinberg, the father

00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:52.174
of the standard model of particle physics,

00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:55.000
has actually flirted with this idea himself,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.243
that all possible realities actually exist.

00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:02.332
