He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:36.784
The laws of quantum field theory for him

00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:39.395
are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."

00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:43.834
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:45.941
that they can form the abyss,

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:47.781

But that's a very primitive view of what

00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:54.108
a physical law is, right?

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:57.363
We know that physical laws are actually

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:00.407
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities
