00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:32.993
He said, this model is just equations.

00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:35.852
What breathes fire into the equations

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.774
and creates a world for them to describe?

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:39.907
He was puzzled by this,

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:43.712
so equations themselves can't do the magic,

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:45.850
can't resolve the puzzle of existence.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.763
And besides, even if the laws could do that,

00:07:48.763 --> 00:07:50.586
why this set of laws?

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.150
Why quantum field theory that describes

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.850
a universe with a certain number of forces

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.899
and particles and so forth?

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.190
Why not a completely different set of laws?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.478
There are many, many mathematically
consistent sets of laws.
