00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.243
or the great chain of being,

00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:35.110
that reality is actually as full as possible.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.811
It's as far removed from nothingness

00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.706
as it could possibly be.

00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:42.200
So we have these two extremes now.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.499
We have sheer nothingness on one side,

00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:47.997
and we have this vision of a reality

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:51.180
that encompasses every conceivable world

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.909
at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:56.802
nothingness, the simplest possible reality.

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:59.681
Now what's in between these two extremes?

00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:01.708
There are all kinds of intermediate realities
