00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.810
and I hope you do care.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.636
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:37.416
those who don't wonder about
the contingency of their existence,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:40.273
of the contingency of the world's existence,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.936
are mentally deficient.

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:45.883
That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:47.560
So this has been called the most sublime

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.854
and awesome mystery,

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:52.523
the deepest and most far-reaching question

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:53.583
man can pose.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.297
It's obsessed great thinkers.

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.901
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.231
philosopher of the 20th century,

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:01.714
was astonished that there should be a world at all.
