00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:31.849
The fullest possible reality, that's special.

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:33.365
But what are we leaving out here?

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.101
There's also just the crummy,

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:37.856
generic realities

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.477
that aren't special in any way,

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:42.029
that are sort of random.

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:44.756
They're infinitely removed from nothingness,

00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:48.682
but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.

00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:51.202
They're a mixture of chaos and order,

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:55.400
of mathematical elegance and ugliness.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.185
So I would describe these realities

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:01.312
as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,
