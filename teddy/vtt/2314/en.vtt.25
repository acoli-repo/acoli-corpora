00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.499
So I would like to propose that the resolution

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:33.335
to the mystery of existence

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:37.425
is that the reality we exist in

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.481
is one of these generic realities.

00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:42.136
Reality has to turn out some way.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.206
It can either turn out to be nothing

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:47.887
or everything or something in between.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:51.578
So if it has some special feature,

00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:53.768
like being really elegant or really full

00:12:53.768 --> 00:12:55.376
or really simple, like nothingness,

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:57.177
that would require an explanation.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.336
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,
