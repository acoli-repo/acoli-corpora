00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.164
because God created it.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:35.449
And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.960
That's how powerful God is.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.602
He doesn't need any preexisting
materials to fashion a world out of.

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:42.762
He can make it out of sheer nothingness,

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.236
creation ex nihilo.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.181
And by the way, this is what

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.020
most Americans today believe.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.734
There is no mystery of existence for them.

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.302
God made it.

00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:53.888
So let's put this in an equation.

00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.515
I don't have any slides so
I'm going to mime my visuals,

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:57.950
so use your imaginations.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.804
So it's God + nothing = the world.
