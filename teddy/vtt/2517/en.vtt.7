00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.336
We created a website
that actually does this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.376
and we launched it [...] in August,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.000
on two college campuses.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.496
And we included a unique matching system

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.456
where if Mike's first victim
had come forward,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.256
saved her record,
entered into the matching system

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.536
and named Mike,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.936
and Mike's second victim
had done the same thing

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.616
a few months later,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.976
they would have matched

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.496
and the verified contact information
of both survivors

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.256
would have been sent
to the authorities at the same time

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.320
for investigation and follow up.
