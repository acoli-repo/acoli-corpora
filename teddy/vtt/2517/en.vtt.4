00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.816
This means there's practically
no deterrent to assault

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
in the United States.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.496
Now, I'm an infectious disease
epidemiologist by training.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.616
I'm interested in systems and networks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.640
and where we can concentrate
our resources to do the most good.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.320
So this, to me, is a tragic
but a solvable problem.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.416
So when the issue of campus assault
started hitting the news a few years ago,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.816
it felt like a unique opportunity
to make a change.
