00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.320
for investigation and follow up.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.296
If a system like this had existed
for Hannah and her peers,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.856
it's more likely
that they would have reported,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.656
that they would have been believed,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.936
and that Mike would have been
kicked off campus,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
gone to jail, or at least
gotten the help that he needed.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.416
And if we were able to stop
repeat offenders like Mike

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.056
after just their second assault
following a match,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.696
survivors like Hannah
would never even be assaulted

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.000
in the first place.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.856
We could prevent
59 percent of sexual assaults
