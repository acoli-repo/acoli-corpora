00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.256
And this is not an unlikely scenario

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.336
because 90 percent of sexual assaults

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.600
are committed by repeat offenders.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.816
But with such low reporting rates,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.656
it's fairly unlikely that even
repeat perpetrators will be reported,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.216
much less anything happen if they are.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.376
In fact, only six percent
of assaults reported to the police

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.280
end with the assailant
spending a single day in prison.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.480
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance
that they'll get away with it.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.816
This means there's practically
no deterrent to assault
