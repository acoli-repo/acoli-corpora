00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.376
With the option to create
a secure, timestamped document

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.896
of what happened to them,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.960
preserving evidence
even if they don't want to report yet.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.536
And lastly, and perhaps most critically,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.576
with the ability to report their assault

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.240
only if someone else
reported the same assailant.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.056
You see, knowing that you weren't
the only one changes everything.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.416
It changes the way
you frame your own experience,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.896
it changes the way
you think about your perpetrator,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.736
it means that if you do come forward,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.800
you'll have someone else's back
and they'll have yours.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.336
We created a website
that actually does this
