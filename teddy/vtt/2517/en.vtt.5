00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.816
it felt like a unique opportunity
to make a change.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.040
And so we did.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.336
We started by talking
to college survivors.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
And what they wish they'd had
in college is pretty simple;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.416
they wanted a website,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.576
one they could use
at the time and place

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040
that felt safest to them

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.776
with clearly written information
about their reporting options,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.936
with the ability to electronically
report their assault,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.576
rather than having the first step

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.480
to go in and talk to someone
who may or may not believe them.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.376
With the option to create
a secure, timestamped document
