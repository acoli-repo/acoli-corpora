Imagine a future where nobody dies—

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.943
instead, our minds are uploaded 
to a digital world.

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:18.473
They might live on in a realistic,
simulated environment with avatar bodies,

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:23.153
and could still call in and contribute 
to the biological world.

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.244
Mind uploading has powerful appeal—

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:31.674
but what would it actually take to scan a 
person’s brain and upload their mind?
