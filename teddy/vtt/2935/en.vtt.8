Hoover ran a program
called COINTELPRO for 15 years

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.856
which was designed
to spy on and undermine civic groups

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.616
that were devoted
to things like civil rights,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.376
the Women's Rights Movement,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.136
and peace groups and anti-war movements.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.519
And the surveillance didn't stop there.

Lyndon Baines Johnson,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.696
during the election campaign,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.696
had the campaign airplane
of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.520
as part of his effort
to win that election.
