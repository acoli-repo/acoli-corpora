00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.480
and we do not have
the rules in place that we need.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.840
And we are seeing
the ramifications of that.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.456
So fusion centers
are these joint task forces

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.776
between local, state
and federal government

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.016
that are meant to ferret out
domestic terrorism.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.536
And what we've seen
is fusion center reports

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.336
that say that you might be dangerous

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.296
if you voted for a third-party candidate,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.496
or you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.280
or you watched movies that are anti-tax.
