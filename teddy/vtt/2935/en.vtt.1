00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
pro-life and pro-choice,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.336
those of us who are afraid

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.736
that our friends and neighbors
are going to be deported

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.736
or that they'll be added to lists

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.080
because they are Muslim,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.720
people who advocate for gun rights
and for gun control

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.136
and the millions of people
who joined the women's marches

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.936
all across the country this last January.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.616
(Applause)

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.736
We are all activists now,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.240
and that means that we all have something
to worry about from surveillance.
