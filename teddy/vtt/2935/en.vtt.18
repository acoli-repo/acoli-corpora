00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.376
and that means the law
is more important than ever before.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.136
The law is supposed to say

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.176
when the government
has permission to do it,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.336
and it's supposed to ensure
that there's some kind of ramification.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.856
We notice when those laws are broken

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.576
and there's some of kind of
ramification or punishment.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.016
The law is more important than ever
because we are now living in a world

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.136
where only rules
are stopping the government

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.600
from abusing this information.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.440
But the law has fallen down on the job.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.776
Particularly since September 11
the law has fallen down on the job,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.480
and we do not have
the rules in place that we need.
