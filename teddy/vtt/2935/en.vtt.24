or for an international human rights group

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.576
or for a global oil company

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.560
that your friend is a valid
foreign intelligence target?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.056
And what that means is that when
you have conversations with that friend,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.240
the US government
may be collecting that information.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.576
And when that information is collected,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.776

conversations with Americans,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.896
it can then be funneled to the FBI

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.376
where the FBI is allowed
to search through it
