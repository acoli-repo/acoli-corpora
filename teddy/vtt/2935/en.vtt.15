the license plates, the faceprints,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.136
the phone records,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.976
your address books, your buddy lists,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.416
the photos that you upload
to Dropbox or Google Photos,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.416

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.560
that's newly available
at very low expense.
