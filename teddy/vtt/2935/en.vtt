00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.960
We are all activists now.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.896
(Applause)

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.120
Thank you.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.016
I'll just stop here.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.216
(Laughter)

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
From the families who are fighting
to maintain funding for public schools,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.016
the tens of thousands of people
who joined Occupy Wall Street

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.216
or marched with Black Lives Matter

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.800
to protest police brutality
against African Americans,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.256
families that join rallies,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
pro-life and pro-choice,
