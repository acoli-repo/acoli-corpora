00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.896
Today, over 50 percent of American adults

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.320
have their faceprint
in a government database.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.216
The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.776
concocted a plan

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.336
to find out what Americans
were going to gun shows

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.856
by using license plate detectors

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.976
to scan the license plates of cars

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.240
that were in the parking lots
of these events.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.296
Today, we believe that over 70 percent
of police departments

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.416
have automatic license plate
detection technology

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.880
that they're using to track people's cars
as they drive through town.
