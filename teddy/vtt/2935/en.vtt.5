They also picked up sounds of Dr. King

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.176
having sex with women
who were not his wife,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.936
and J. Edgar Hoover
saw the opportunity here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.600
to discredit and undermine
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.016
The FBI sent a package of these recordings

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120
along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.560
and a draft of this note
was found in FBI archives years later,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.016
and the letter said,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.816
"You are no clergyman and you know it.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.400
King, like all frauds,
your end is approaching."
