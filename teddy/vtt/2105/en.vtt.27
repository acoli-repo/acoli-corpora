00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:31.530
Become politically active.

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.427
Make our democracy work the way
it's supposed to work.

00:13:34.753 --> 00:13:40.302
Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions --

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:42.341
global warming pollution --
and trading it.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:46.976
Here's why: as long as the United States
is out of the world system,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.668
it's not a closed system.

00:13:48.692 --> 00:13:52.739
Once it becomes a closed system,
with U.S. participation,

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:54.986
then everybody
who's on a board of directors --

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.999
how many people here
serve on the board of directors

00:13:58.023 --> 00:13:59.277
of a corporation?
