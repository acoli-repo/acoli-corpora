00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:31.738
on this arcane science
of carbon calculation,

00:10:31.762 --> 00:10:35.864
to construct a consumer-friendly
carbon calculator.

00:10:36.317 --> 00:10:42.526
You can very precisely calculate
what your CO2 emissions are,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.868
and then you will be given
options to reduce.

00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:49.089
And by the time the movie
comes out in May,

00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:50.976
this will be updated to 2.0,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.434
and we will have click-through
purchases of offsets.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.222
Next, consider making
your business carbon-neutral.

00:10:58.246 --> 00:10:59.854
Again, some of us have done that,

00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:01.884
and it's not as hard as you think.
