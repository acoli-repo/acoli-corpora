00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.283
what the man said -- they laughed.

00:03:30.703 --> 00:03:34.286
I gave my speech, then went back
out to the airport to fly back home.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.176
I fell asleep on the plane

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.738
until, during the middle
of the night, we landed

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:40.976
on the Azores Islands for refueling.

00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:44.476
I woke up, they opened the door,
I went out to get some fresh air,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.976
and I looked, and there was a man
running across the runway.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.055
And he was waving a piece
of paper, and he was yelling,

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.153
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.426
And I thought to myself,
in the middle of the night,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.886
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.130
what in the world could be
wrong in Washington?
