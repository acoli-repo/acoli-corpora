00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:41.184
'My wife Tipper and I have opened
a low-cost family restaurant'" --

00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:42.850
(Laughter)

00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:44.222
"'named Shoney's,

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.045
and we are running it ourselves.'"

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.389
(Laughter)

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:51.571

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.976
one of them had me
in a big white chef's hat,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.429
Tipper was saying,
"One more burger with fries!"
