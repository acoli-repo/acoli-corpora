00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.602
This was a rented Ford Taurus.

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:03.130
(Laughter)

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:05.160
It was dinnertime,

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.104
and we started looking for a place to eat.

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:09.993
We were on I-40.

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:13.214
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:16.926
We got off the exit,
we found a Shoney's restaurant.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.989
Low-cost family restaurant chain,
for those of you who don't know it.

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:26.312
We went in and sat down at the booth,
and the waitress came over,

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.322
made a big commotion over Tipper.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:30.809
(Laughter)
