what in the world could be

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.415
Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.976
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.927
But what it turned out to be,

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.262
was that my staff was extremely upset

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:21.488
because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:22.932
about my speech,

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:24.932
and it had already been printed in cities

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:27.288
all across the United States of America.

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.140
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:30.314
(Laughter)
