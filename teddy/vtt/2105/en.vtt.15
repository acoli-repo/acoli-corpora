00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.131
but I want you to put it in perspective.

00:07:32.893 --> 00:07:37.490
It's an easy, visible target of concern --

00:07:37.514 --> 00:07:38.976
and it should be --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.679
but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:45.425
than from cars and trucks.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.641
Cars and trucks are very significant,

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:51.250
and we have the lowest
standards in the world.

00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:54.300
And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:59.685
Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:04.051
Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency
