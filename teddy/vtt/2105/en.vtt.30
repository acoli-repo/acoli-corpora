I need your help on this.

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:05.868
Somebody said the test
we're facing now, a scientist told me,

00:15:05.892 --> 00:15:08.976
is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.817
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

00:15:11.947 --> 00:15:13.446
(Laughter)

00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.382
That's really true.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.560
I said the other night,
and I'll repeat now:

00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:23.749
this is not a political issue.

00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:29.312
Again, the Republicans here --
this shouldn't be partisan.

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:32.976
You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do.
