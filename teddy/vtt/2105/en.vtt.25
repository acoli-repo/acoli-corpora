00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:30.606
re-purposed, with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.700
with a generic approach,

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:35.423
and it's not just the slides,
it's what they mean.

00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:37.048
And it's how they link together.

00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:41.659
And so I'm going to be conducting
a course this summer

00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:45.518
for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.771
to come and then give it en masse,

00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:49.976
in communities all across the country,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.665
and we're going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week,

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:57.720
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:01.625
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,
somewhere in that process,
