00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:03.246
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.976
Use light rail.

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:08.287
Figure out some of the other options
that are much better.

00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.476
It's important.

00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:11.973
Be a green consumer.

00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:14.976
You have choices with everything you buy,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.607
between things that have a harsh effect,

00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:24.131
or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.702
Consider this:

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:29.978
Make a decision to live
a carbon-neutral life.
