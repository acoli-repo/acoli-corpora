00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.119
There's been kind
of a series of epiphanies.

00:03:00.143 --> 00:03:01.287
(Laughter)

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:04.976
The very next day,
continuing the totally true story,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.976
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.856
in the city of Lagos,
on the topic of energy.

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:18.097
And I began the speech
by telling them the story

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.834
of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:24.502
And I told it pretty much the same way
I've just shared it with you:

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.264
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,

00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:28.326
Shoney's, low-cost
family restaurant chain,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.283
what the man said -- they laughed.
