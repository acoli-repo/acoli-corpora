00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.249
I'm going to show some new images,

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:07.396
and I'm going to recapitulate
just four or five.

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:09.647
Now, the slide show.

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.976
I update the slide show
every time I give it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.237
I add new images,

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:17.166
because I learn more about it
every time I give it.

00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:19.774
It's like beach-combing, you know?

00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:22.976
Every time the tide comes in and out,
you find some more shells.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.983
Just in the last two days, we got
the new temperature records in January.

00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:32.017
This is just for
the United States of America.
