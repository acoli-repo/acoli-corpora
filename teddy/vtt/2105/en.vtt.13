00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:32.017
This is just for
the United States of America.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:34.779
Historical average
for Januarys is 31 degrees;

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:38.487
last month was 39.5 degrees.

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:43.745
Now, I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment --

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:44.937
I'm kidding.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:48.460
But these are the recapitulation slides,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:51.878
and then I'm going to go into new
material about what you can do.

00:06:51.902 --> 00:06:54.297
But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these.

00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:57.632
First of all, this is where
we're projected to go

00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:59.758
with the U.S. contribution
to global warming,

00:06:59.782 --> 00:07:01.566
under business as usual.
