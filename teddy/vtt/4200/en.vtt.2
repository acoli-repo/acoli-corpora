(Singing) Prahlad Tipanya: Everyone came
from one place and took the same road

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:15.829
Half way along, you fell into doubt
and it became twelve roads

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.633
This is the way of getting
to the river from the twelve paths.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:32.379
Everyone draws water from river banks
No one draws where there is no bank
