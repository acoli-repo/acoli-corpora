Everyone draws water from river banks
No one draws where there is no bank

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:44.829
No bank is like the bank of Kabir
The one who draws there he becomes pure

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.999
That is when we will understand

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.399
that we have all come from one place
and have to go back there.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.440
To this, Kabir says:

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.960
