Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle.

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:12.393
How long would it take

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.773
if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands?

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:17.159
Longer, right?

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.564
Because the pain would distract
you from the task.

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:21.025
Well, maybe not;

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:23.429
it depends on how you handle pain.

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:25.337
Some people are distracted by pain.

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.908
It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well.

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:32.705
Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain,
