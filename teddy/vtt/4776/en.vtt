00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.269
There's a common misconception

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.000
that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.573
keep your hands clean,

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:15.727
or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail,

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:19.152
you might have OCD.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:24.129
In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.348
is a serious psychiatric condition

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:28.623
that is frequently 
misunderstood by society

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:31.739
and mental health professionals alike.
