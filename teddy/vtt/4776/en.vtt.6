00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:02.236
OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder.

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:06.466
In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:10.228
are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:12.701
Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.900
variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.575
voluntary movement,

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:22.261
and emotional and motivational responses.

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:24.089
The other piece of the puzzle

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.271
is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin,

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.023
a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures
