00:03:56.726 --> 00:04:00.254
The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD,

00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:03.462
including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain

00:04:03.462 --> 00:04:06.513
by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:11.517
behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties,

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:14.660
and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive therapy,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.188
or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond
to other forms of treatment.

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:21.762
Knowing that your own brain 
is lying to you

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:26.000
while not being able 
to resist its commands can be agonizing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.105
But with knowledge and understanding
comes the power to seek help,
