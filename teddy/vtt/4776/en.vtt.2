00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.217
The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD,

00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:04.079
like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly,

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.029
may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.847
that many of us exhibit from time to time.

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:16.264
But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating.

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:20.279
People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.333
and compulsive behaviors,

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.108
which tend to be time consuming

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:28.405
and interfere with work, 
school or social life

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:31.230
to the point of causing 
significant distress.
