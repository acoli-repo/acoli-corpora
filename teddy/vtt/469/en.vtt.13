and how real change

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.815
happens for us.

00:06:34.657 --> 00:06:39.231
For me, it wasn't the mandatory
programs inside of the prison.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.725
Instead, it was listening
to the advice of elders --

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:49.262
men who have been sentenced to spend
the rest of their lives in prison.

00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:53.977
These men helped me reframe
my mindset around manhood.

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:59.678
And they instilled in me
all of their aspirations and goals,

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.073
in the hopes that I would never
return to prison,
