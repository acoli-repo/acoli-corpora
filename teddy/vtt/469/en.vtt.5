00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.809
I talked about how my sisters and I
watched our mother suffer years of abuse

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.237
at the hands of our stepfather,

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:38.362
escaping, only to find ourselves
living in a shelter.

00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:43.268
I talked about how I swore
an oath to my family

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:44.492
to keep them safe.

00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:49.386
I even explained how I didn't feel
like a teenager at 13,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.663
but more like a soldier on a mission.

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.608
And like any soldier,

00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:56.741
this meant carrying an emotional
burden on my shoulders,

00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.553
and I hate to say it,
