00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.549
I walked right back into prison.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:04.090
But thankfully, this time
it was just as a student,

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.835
to join my fellow classmates.

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:09.513
And this time,

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:12.075
I got to go home when class was over.

00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:17.124
In the next session, we talked
about what had brought each of us

00:02:17.148 --> 00:02:18.423
to this point of our lives

00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:20.022
and into the classroom together.

00:02:20.046 --> 00:02:21.734
I eventually got comfortable enough

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:23.925
to reveal my truth to everyone in the room

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.549
about where I came from.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.809
I talked about how my sisters and I
watched our mother suffer years of abuse
