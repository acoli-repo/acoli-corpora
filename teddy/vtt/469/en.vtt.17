00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.958
We presented our proposals

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:34.775
to the state Department
of Corrections commissioner

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.823
and to the Manhattan DA,

00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:40.406
at our graduation in a packed
Columbia auditorium.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.815
As a team,

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.974
I couldn't have imagined
a more memorable way

00:08:45.998 --> 00:08:48.046
to conclude our eight weeks together.

00:08:48.617 --> 00:08:51.109
And just 10 months
after coming home from prison,

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:53.733
I again found myself in a strange room,

00:08:54.942 --> 00:08:59.472
invited by the commissioner of NYPD
to share my perspective

00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:00.829
at a policing summit.
