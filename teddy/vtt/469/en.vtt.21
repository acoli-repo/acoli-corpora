00:10:30.188 --> 00:10:34.768
Our society and justice system
has convinced us

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:36.410
that we can lock up our problems

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:38.830
and punish our way
out of social challenges.

00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:40.895
But that's not real.

00:10:41.522 --> 00:10:43.217
Imagine with me for a second

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:46.742
a future where no one can become

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:48.318
a prosecutor,

00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:50.169
a judge,

00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:51.879
a cop

00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:53.950
or even a parole officer

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:56.108
without first sitting in a classroom

00:10:56.132 --> 00:10:57.966
to learn from and connect with

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.784
the very people whose lives
will be in their hands.
