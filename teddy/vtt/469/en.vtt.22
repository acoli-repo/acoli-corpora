00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.784
the very people whose lives
will be in their hands.

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:04.649
I'm doing my part to promote
the power of conversations

00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:06.522
and the need for collaborations.

00:11:07.863 --> 00:11:09.783
It is through education

00:11:09.807 --> 00:11:13.958
that we will arrive at a truth
that is inclusive and unites us all

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:15.492
in the pursuit of justice.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.237
For me, it was a brand-new conversation

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.276
and a new kind of classroom

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.426
that showed me how both my mindset

00:11:27.394 --> 00:11:29.286
and our criminal justice system

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.643
could be transformed.
