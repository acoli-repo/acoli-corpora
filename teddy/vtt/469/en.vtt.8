00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:06.125
I learned later on they attacked my sister
in a case of mistaken identity,

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:07.781
thinking she was someone else.

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:09.752
It was terrifying,

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:13.966
but clear that I wasn't trained,
nor was I qualified,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.522
to be the soldier
that I thought I needed to be.

00:04:17.776 --> 00:04:19.050
But in my neighborhood,

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:22.656
I only felt safe carrying a weapon.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.545
Now, back in the classroom,
after hearing my story,

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.388
the prosecutors could tell
I never wanted to hurt anyone.
