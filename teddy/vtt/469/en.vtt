00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.651
When I look in the mirror today,

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:06.938
I see a justice and education scholar
at Columbia University,

00:00:08.023 --> 00:00:11.649
a youth mentor, an activist

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:13.672
and a future New York state senator.

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:16.276
(Cheering)

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.379
I see all of that

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:22.148
and a man who spent
a quarter of his life in state prison --

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.269
six years, to be exact,

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.506
starting as a teenager on Rikers Island

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.791
for an act that nearly cost
a man his life.
