00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.791
for an act that nearly cost
a man his life.

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:34.798
But what got me from there to here

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.449
wasn't the punishment I faced
as a teenager in adult prison

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.431
or the harshness of our legal system.

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:46.270
Instead, it was a learning
environment of a classroom

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:49.607
that introduced me to something
I didn't think was possible for me

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:52.332
or our justice system as a whole.

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.922
A few weeks before my release on parole,

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:58.780
a counselor encouraged me to enroll
in a new college course

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.195
being offered in the prison.
