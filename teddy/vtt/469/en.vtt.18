00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:00.829
at a policing summit.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:03.601
And while speaking,

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.925
I recognized a familiar face
in the audience.

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:10.334
It was the attorney
who prosecuted my case.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.446
Seeing him,

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.987
I thought about our days in the courtroom

00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:22.332
seven years earlier,

00:09:22.356 --> 00:09:26.123
as I listened to him recommend
a long prison sentence,

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:29.027
as if my young life was meaningless

00:09:29.932 --> 00:09:31.178
and had no potential.
