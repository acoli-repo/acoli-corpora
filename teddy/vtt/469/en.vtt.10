00:04:57.744 --> 00:05:01.220
But the stories
of these individuals' lives

00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:02.982
before they commit those acts

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:06.099
were the kinds of stories
these prosecutors had never heard.

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:10.435
And when it was their turn
to speak -- the prosecutors --

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:11.859
I was surprised, too.

00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:15.093
They weren't emotionless
drones or robocops,

00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:17.224
preprogrammed to send people to prison.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.049
They were sons and daughters,

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:22.613
brothers and sisters.

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:26.256
But most of all, they were good students.

00:05:26.915 --> 00:05:29.161
They were ambitious and motivated.
