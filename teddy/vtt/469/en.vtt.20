00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:02.402
I carry all of these experiences with me,

00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:06.759
as I develop the Justice Ambassadors
Youth Council at Columbia University,

00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:10.248
bringing young New Yorkers -- some
who have already spent time locked up

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:12.697
and others who are still
enrolled in high school --

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.137
together with city officials.

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.413
And in this classroom,

00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:18.077
everyone will brainstorm ideas

00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:21.235
about improving the lives
of our city's most vulnerable youth

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:24.717
before they get tried
within the criminal justice system.

00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:28.746
This is possible if we do the work.
