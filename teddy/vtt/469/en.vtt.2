00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.195
being offered in the prison.

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.756
It was called Inside Criminal Justice.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.245
That seems pretty
straightforward, though, right?

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.426
Well, it turns out,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.363
the class would be made up
of eight incarcerated men

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:11.512
and eight assistant district attorneys.

Columbia University psychology
professor Geraldine Downey

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.307
and Manhattan Assistant DA Lucy Lang

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.553
co-taught the course,

00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:21.500
and it was the first of its kind.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:23.348
I can honestly say

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:26.461
this wasn't how I imagined
starting college.

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:29.258
My mind was blown from day one.

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:32.096
I assumed all the prosecutors
in the room would be white.
