00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:32.096
I assumed all the prosecutors
in the room would be white.

00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:36.093
But I remember walking into the room
on the first day of class

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:37.982
and seeing three black prosecutors

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:39.307
and thinking to myself,

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.476
"Wow, being a black prosecutor --

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.657
that's a thing!"

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.567
(Laughter)

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:49.895
By the end of the first session,

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:51.099
I was all in.

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:54.370
In fact, a few weeks after my release,

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.734
I found myself doing something
I prayed I wouldn't.

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:00.549
I walked right back into prison.
