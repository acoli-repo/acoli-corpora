00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:31.498
As I felt warm blood ooze down my face,

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.034
and watching him raise
his knife toward me again,

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:40.400
I turned to defend myself
and pulled that gun from my waistband

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:42.799
and squeezed the trigger.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.747
Thankfully, he didn't lose
his life that day.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.407
My hands shaking and heart racing,
I was paralyzed in fear.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:56.240
From that moment,

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:59.599
I felt regret that would never leave me.
