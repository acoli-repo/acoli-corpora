00:08:59.898 --> 00:09:01.704
and Lumiar says the following:

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:05.881
Let's divide this role
of the teacher into two.

00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:08.242
One guy, we'll call a tutor.

00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:13.217
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek
"paideia": Look after the kid.

00:09:13.217 --> 00:09:17.047
What's happening at home,
what's their moment in life, etc..

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:18.387
But please don't teach,

00:09:18.387 --> 00:09:21.797
because the little you know compared 
to Google, we don't want to know.

00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:22.949
Keep that to yourself.

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.297
(Laughter)

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:28.250
Now, we'll bring in people
who have two things:

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.617
passion and expertise, and it could be
their profession or not.
