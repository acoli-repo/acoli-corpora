Anyone who's interested
in interviewing, you will show up.

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:05.261
And then we'll see what happens
out of the intuition that rises from that,

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:09.303
instead of just filling out the little 
items of whether you're the right person.

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:11.420
And then, come back.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.481
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,
talk to anybody you want.

00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:17.542
Make sure we are the bride 
you thought we were

00:04:17.542 --> 00:04:20.605
and not all the bullshit
we put into our own ads.

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:22.681
(Laughter)

00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:26.377
Slowly we went to a process 
where we'd say things like,

00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:29.138
we don't want anyone to be
a leader in the company

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:31.281
if they haven't been 
interviewed and approved
