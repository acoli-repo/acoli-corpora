00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:32.110
It's something where we keep
the Brazilian curriculum

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.778
with 600 tiles of a mosaic,

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.915
which we want to expose these kids
to by the time they're 17.

00:11:37.915 --> 00:11:40.750
And follow this all the time
and we know how they're doing

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.790
and we say, you're not interested 
in this now, let's wait a year.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:49.036
And the kids are in groups
that don't have an age category,

00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:52.762
so the six-year-old kid
who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:55.127
that eliminates all of the gangs
and the groups

00:11:55.127 --> 00:11:59.012
and this stuff that we have 
in the schools, in general.

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:01.453
And they have a zero 
to 100 percent grading,
