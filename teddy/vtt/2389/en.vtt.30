00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:01.958
in part of those terminal days.

00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.375
And some people would say,

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:05.913
oh, so now you have this time,
these terminal days,

00:15:05.913 --> 00:15:07.771
and so you go out and do everything.

00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:10.093
No, we've been to the beaches,

00:15:10.093 --> 00:15:12.655
so we've been to Samoa and Maldives
and Mozambique,

00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:14.421
so that's done.

00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:16.530
I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.401
I've gone down 60 meters to see 
hammerhead sharks.

00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:24.952
I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel
from Chad to Timbuktu.

00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:28.943
I've gone to the magnetic 
North Pole on a dog sled.

00:15:28.943 --> 00:15:30.719
So, we've been busy.
