By the third why, you don't really know
why you're doing what you're doing.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.688
What I want to leave you with is the seed
and the thought that maybe if you do this,

00:17:06.688 --> 00:17:09.444
you will come to the question, what for?

00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:10.946
What am I doing this for?

00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.827
And hopefully, as a result of that,
and over time,

00:17:13.827 --> 00:17:16.960
I hope that with this,
and that's what I'm wishing you,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.663
you'll have a much wiser future.

00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.448
Thank you very much.

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:28.987
