00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.585
this is how you go to meetings,
this is what you say,

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:32.906
this is what you don't say,

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.412
and let's see what's left.

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:36.242
So we started this about 30 years ago,

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:38.767
and we started dealing
with this very issue.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.964
And so we said, look, the retirement,

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:44.106
the whole issue of how 
we distribute our graph of life.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:47.263
Instead of going mountain climbing
when you're 82,

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:49.436
why don't you do it next week?

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.791
And we'll do it like this,

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:55.187
we'll sell you back your Wednesdays
for 10 percent of your salary.

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:59.440
So now, if you were going to be 
a violinist, which you probably weren't,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.594
you go and do this on Wednesday.
