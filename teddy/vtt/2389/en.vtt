00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:05.178
On Mondays and Thursdays,
I learn how to die.

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:07.102
I call them my terminal days.

00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:09.936
My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,

00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:14.738
but a lot of people in my family died
of melanoma cancer

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:17.373
and my parents and grandparents had it.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:20.657
And I kept thinking, one day I could
be sitting in front of a doctor

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:22.779
who looks at my exams and says,

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.094
"Ricardo, things don't look very good.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.773
You have six months or a year to live."

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:31.019
And you start thinking about
what you would do with this time.
