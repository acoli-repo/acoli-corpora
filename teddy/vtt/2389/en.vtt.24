00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:01.453
And they have a zero 
to 100 percent grading,

00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:05.254
which they do themselves with an app
every couple of hours.

00:12:05.254 --> 00:12:09.689
Until we know they're 37 percent of the
way we'd like them to be on this issue,

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:14.584
so that we can send them out in the world
with them knowing enough about it.

00:12:14.584 --> 00:12:19.827
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,
or building a bicycle.

00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:24.098
And people will sign up for 
a 45-day course on building a bicycle.

00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:28.667
Now, try to build a bicycle without 
knowing that pi is 3.1416.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.431
You can't.
