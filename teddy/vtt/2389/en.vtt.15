00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:31.210
So our board had two seats open 
with the same voting rights,

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.328
for the first two people who showed up.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.896
(Laughter)

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:40.132
And so we had cleaning ladies voting
on a board meeting,

00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:43.228
which had a lot of other very important
people in suits and ties.

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:46.857
And the fact is that they kept us honest.

00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:50.606
This process, as we started looking
at the people who came to us,

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:52.184
we'd say, now wait a second,

00:07:52.184 --> 00:07:55.067
people come to us and they say,
where am I supposed to sit?

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:58.307
How am I supposed to work?
Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?

00:07:58.308 --> 00:08:01.386
And we looked at that and we said,
we have to start much earlier.
