if they haven't been 
interviewed and approved

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:34.132
by their future subordinates.

00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:39.009
Every six months, everyone gets 
evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.

00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:43.620
And this determines whether they should
continue in that leadership position,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.410
which is many times
situational, as you know.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.464
And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent 
of a grade, they don't stay,

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:56.803
which is probably the reason why
I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.

00:04:56.803 --> 00:05:00.699
And over time, we started asking
other questions.
