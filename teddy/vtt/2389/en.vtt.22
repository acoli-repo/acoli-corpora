Sure, for a week, try.

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:05.478
They came up with the very same
rules that we had,

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:06.869
except they're theirs.

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:09.114
And then, they have the power,

00:11:09.114 --> 00:11:14.106
which means, they can and do
suspend and expel kids

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:19.504
so that we're not playing school,
they really decide.

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:22.547
And then, in this same vein,

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:24.941
we keep a digital mosaic,

00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:28.572
because this is not constructivist
or Montessori or something.

00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:32.110
It's something where we keep
the Brazilian curriculum
