00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.194
And I will do, during those days,

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.721
whatever it is I was going to do
if I had received that piece of news.

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.094
(Laughter)

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.128
When you think about --

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:12.293
(Applause)

00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:14.770
when you think about the opposite of work,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.247
we, many times, think it's leisure.

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:20.314
And you say, ah, I need 
some leisure time, and so forth.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.851
But the fact is that,
leisure is a very busy thing.

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.250
You go play golf and tennis,
and you meet people,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.360
and you're going for lunch,
and you're late for the movies.

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:31.410
It's a very crowded thing that we do.
