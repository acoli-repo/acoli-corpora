00:04:56.803 --> 00:05:00.699
And over time, we started asking
other questions.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.215
We said things like,

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:05.544
why can't people set their own salaries?

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:07.120
What do they need to know?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.183
There's only three things 
you need to know:

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.518
how much people make inside the company,

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:14.387
how much people make somewhere
else in a similar business

00:05:14.387 --> 00:05:17.679
and how much we make in general
to see whether we can afford it.

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:20.264
So let's give people these three
pieces of information.

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:22.272
So we started having, in the cafeteria,

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:24.773
a computer where you could go in 
and you could ask

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:26.970
what someone spent, 
how much someone makes,

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.450
what they make in benefits, 
what the company makes,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.760
what the margins are, and so forth.
