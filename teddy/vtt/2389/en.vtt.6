WEBVTT

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.594
you go and do this on Wednesday.

00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:02.941
And what we found --

00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:05.478
we thought, these are the older people

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:08.077
who are going to be really interested
in this program.

00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:10.531
And the average age
of the first people who adhered

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:11.979
were 29, of course.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.337
And so we started looking,

00:03:13.337 --> 00:03:15.837
and we said, we have to do things
in a different way.

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:17.608
So we started saying things like,

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:19.982
why do we want to know
what time you came to work,

00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:21.233
what time you left, etc.?

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.587
Can't we exchange this for a contract

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:27.049
for buying something from you,
some kind of work?

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.070
Why are we building these headquarters?

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.838
Is it not an ego issue
that we want to look solid
