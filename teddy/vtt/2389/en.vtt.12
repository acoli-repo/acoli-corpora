00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.895
And more, even when we had
thousands of people, 5,000 people,

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.273
we had two people in the H.R. department,

00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:06.671
and thankfully one of them has retired.

00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:08.630
(Laughter)

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.384
And so, the question we were asking was,
how can we be taking care of people?

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.187
People are the only thing we have.

00:06:14.187 --> 00:06:17.625
We can't have a department that runs
after people and looks after people.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:23.006
So as we started finding that this worked,
and we'd say, we're looking for --

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:25.701
and this is, I think,
the main thing I was looking for

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.744
in the terminal days and in the company,

00:06:27.744 --> 00:06:31.313
which is, how do you set up for wisdom?
