00:07:58.308 --> 00:08:01.386
And we looked at that and we said,
we have to start much earlier.

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:02.409
Where do we start?

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:04.924
We said, oh, kindergarten 
seems like a good place.

00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:09.581
So we set up a foundation, which now has, 
for 11 years, three schools,

00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:11.883
where we started asking
the same questions,

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:14.795
how do you redesign school for wisdom?

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:17.724
It is one thing to say,
we need to recycle the teachers,

00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.398
we need the directors to do more.

00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:25.333
But the fact is that what we do
with education is entirely obsolete.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:27.831
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:33.478
Going from a math class, to biology,
to 14th-century France is very silly.
