00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:02.846
Things like, how do we measure
ourselves as humans?

00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:06.472
So there's a place for math and physics
and all that there.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.336
How do we express ourselves?

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:10.741
So there's a place
for music and literature, etc.,

00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:12.385
but also for grammar.

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:15.042
And then we have things
that everyone has forgotten,

00:10:15.042 --> 00:10:17.611
which are probably the most 
important things in life.

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:21.309
The very important things in life,
we know nothing about.

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:23.549
We know nothing about love,

00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:25.641
we know nothing about death,

00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:27.718
we know nothing about why we're here.

00:10:27.718 --> 00:10:32.252
So we need a thread in school that
talks about everything we don't know.
