00:10:27.718 --> 00:10:32.252
So we need a thread in school that
talks about everything we don't know.

00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:34.356
So that's a big part of what we do.

00:10:34.356 --> 00:10:39.951
(Applause)

00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:42.869
So over the years, we started going
into other things.

00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:45.031
We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:47.822
and say, sit down and come here 
and do that, and so forth.

00:10:47.822 --> 00:10:51.137
We said, let's get the kids to do 
something we call a circle,

00:10:51.137 --> 00:10:52.402
which meets once a week.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.712
And we'd say, you put the rules together

00:10:54.712 --> 00:10:57.039
and then you decide
what you want to do with it.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:59.221
So can you all hit yourself on the head?

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.543
Sure, for a week, try.
