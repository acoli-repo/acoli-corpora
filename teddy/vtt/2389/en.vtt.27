if you had made money with money
instead of sharing as you go.

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.480
But I like sharing as you go better.

I taught MBAs at MIT for a time

00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:44.664
and I ended up, one day,
at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

00:13:44.664 --> 00:13:46.608

00:13:52.044 --> 00:13:54.817
and these wonderful people 
who'd done great things

00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:58.699
and I thought, what do I want 
to be remembered for?

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:00.485
And I did another stroll around,
