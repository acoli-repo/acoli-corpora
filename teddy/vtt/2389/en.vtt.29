00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:30.438
And that did two things.

00:14:30.438 --> 00:14:35.363
One, it freed our five kids
from following in our steps, our shadow --

00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:37.019
They don't know what I do.

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:38.243
(Laughter)

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:39.552
Which is good.

00:14:39.552 --> 00:14:41.477
And I'm not going to take them somewhere

00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:43.871
and say, one day 
all of this will be yours.

00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:45.428
(Laughter)

00:14:45.428 --> 00:14:48.960
The five kids know nothing, which is good.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.641
And the second thing is,

00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:55.339
I freed myself from this anchor
of past achievement or whatever.

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:59.837
I'm free to start something new every time
and to decide things from scratch

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:01.958
in part of those terminal days.
