00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:00.485
And I did another stroll around,

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.930
and the second time,
another question came to me,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.233
which did me better, which was,

00:14:05.233 --> 00:14:08.120
why do I want to be remembered at all?

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.257
(Laughter)

00:14:10.257 --> 00:14:13.078

we had a big pit with fire,

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:23.084
and I threw everything I had ever 
done into that fire.

00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:25.471
This is a book in 38 languages,

00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:29.018
hundreds and hundreds of articles
and DVDs, everything there was.

00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:30.438
And that did two things.
