00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.838
Is it not an ego issue
that we want to look solid

00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:33.717
and big and important?

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:37.001
But we're dragging you two hours
across town because of it?

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.532
So we started asking questions one by one.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:41.925
We'd say it like this:

00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:44.207
One: How do we find people?

00:03:44.207 --> 00:03:47.390
We'd go out and try
and recruit people and we'd say,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.943
look, when you come to us,

00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:51.165
we're not going to have
two or three interviews

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:53.577
and then you're going to be
married to us for life.

00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:55.727
That's not how we do 
the rest of our lives.

00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:57.832
So, come have your interviews.

00:03:57.832 --> 00:04:01.268
Anyone who's interested
in interviewing, you will show up.
