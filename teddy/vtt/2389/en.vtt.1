00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:31.019
And you start thinking about
what you would do with this time.

00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:33.814

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:53.986

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:58.825
Every Monday and Thursday,
I'm going use my terminal days.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.194
And I will do, during those days,
