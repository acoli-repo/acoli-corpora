00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.336
This is an ecosystem,
a functioning ecosystem.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.816
It's creating soil.
It's sequestering carbon.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.736
There's pollination going on.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.720
I mean, this is really an ecosystem.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.256
So scientists have started calling
ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.856
because they're often
dominated by non-native species,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.616
and because they're just super weird.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.096
They're just unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.136
For so long, we dismissed
all these novel ecosystems as trash.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.576
We're talking about
regrown agricultural fields,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.176
timber plantations that are not
being managed on a day-to-day basis,
