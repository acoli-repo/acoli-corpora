00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.920
So let me explain.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.136
Right now, humans use half of the world

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.856
to live, to grow their crops
and their timber,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.776
to pasture their animals.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.616
If you added up all the human beings,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.880
we would weigh 10 times as much
as all the wild mammals put together.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.120
We cut roads through the forest.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.016
We have added little plastic particles
to the sand on ocean beaches.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.136
We've changed the chemistry of the soil
with our artificial fertilizers.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.376
And of course, we've changed
the chemistry of the air.
