00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.656
You can't take home the pinecones.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.585
There are so many rules and restrictions

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.576
that from a child's point of view,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400
this is, like, the worst nature ever.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.936
Because children don't want to hike

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.296
through a beautiful landscape
for five hours

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.176
and then look at a beautiful view.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200
That's maybe what we want to do as adults,

00:09:16.224 --> 00:09:19.136
but what kids want to do
is hunker down in one spot

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.376
and just tinker with it,
just work with it,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.960
just pick it up, build a house,
build a fort, do something like that.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.696
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.976
are often distant from where people live.
