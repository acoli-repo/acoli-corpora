00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.840
We are stealing nature from our children.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.896
Now, when I say this, I don't mean
that we are destroying nature

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.296
that they will have wanted us to preserve,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.976
although that is
unfortunately also the case.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.816
What I mean here is that we've started
to define nature in a way

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.856
that's so purist and so strict

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.616
that under the definition
we're creating for ourselves,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.016
there won't be any nature
left for our children

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.240
when they're adults.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.656
But there's a fix for this.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.920
So let me explain.
