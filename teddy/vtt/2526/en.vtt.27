00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.960
If we dismiss these new natures
as not acceptable or trashy or no good,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.616
we might as well just pave them over.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.176
And in a world where
everything is changing,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.000
we need to be very careful
about how we define nature.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.856
In order not to steal it
from our children,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.816
we have to do two things.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.680
First, we cannot define nature
as that which is untouched.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.936
This never made any sense anyway.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.456
Nature has not been untouched
for thousands of years.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.296
And it excludes most of the nature
that most people can visit
