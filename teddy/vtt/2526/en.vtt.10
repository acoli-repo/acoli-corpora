00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.296
They domesticate crops.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.216
They use the natural resources
to build their houses,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.496
to thatch their houses.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.536
They even make pets out of animals
that we consider to be wild animals.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.656
These people are there

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.776
and they're interacting
with the environment

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.296
in a way that's really meaningful
and that you can see in the environment.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.536
Now, I was with
an anthropologist on this trip,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.416
and he told me, as we were
floating down the river,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.096
he said, "There are
no demographic voids in the Amazon."

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.056
This statement has really stuck with me,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.936
because what it means
is that the whole Amazon is like this.
