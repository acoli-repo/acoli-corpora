I disagree with this.
I just disagree with this.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.616
I disagree with this definition of nature,
because, fundamentally, we are animals.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.456
Right? Like, we evolved on this planet

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.576
in the context of all the other animals
with which we share a planet,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.176
and all the other plants,
and all the other microbes.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.496
And so I think that nature

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.576
is not that which is untouched
by humanity, man or woman.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.736
I think that nature
is anywhere where life thrives,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.776
anywhere where there are
multiple species together,
