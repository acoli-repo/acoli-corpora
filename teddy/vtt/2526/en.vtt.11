and not just tropical forests.

People have influenced
ecosystems in the past,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.856
and they continue
to influence them in the present,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.040

untouched by humanity

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.296
or not having people in it,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.656
if all of those actually give us
a result where we don't have any nature,
