00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.896
It's awesome. National Geographic
sent me to Manú National Park,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.496
which is in the Peruvian Amazon,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.176
but it's a big chunk of rainforest,
uncleared, no roads,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.816
protected as a national park,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.536
one of the most, in fact,
biodiverse parks in the world.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.680
And when I got in there with my canoe,
what did I find, but people.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.456
People have been living there
for hundreds and thousands of years.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.336
People live there, and they don't
just float over the jungle.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960
They have a meaningful relationship
with the landscape.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.776
They hunt. They grow crops.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.296
They domesticate crops.
