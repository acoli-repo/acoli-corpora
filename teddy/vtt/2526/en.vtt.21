We've spent too much time
watching David Attenborough documentaries

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.696
where the nature is really sexy --

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.736
(Laughter)

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.696
and we've forgotten how to see the nature
that is literally right outside our door,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.656
the nature of the street tree.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.456
So here's an example: Philadelphia.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.856
There's this cool elevated railway

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.296
that you can see from the ground,
that's been abandoned.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.736
Now, this may sound like the beginning
of the High Line story in Manhattan,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.056
and it's very similar, except they haven't
developed this into a park yet,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.616
although they're working on it.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.816
So for now, it's still this little
sort of secret wilderness
