that flies under the radar,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.400
it's arguably more wild
than a national park,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.576
because national parks

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.336
in the 21st century.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.936
Crater Lake in southern Oregon,
which is my closest national park,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.136
is a beautiful example of a landscape
that seems to be coming out of the past.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.896
But they're managing it carefully.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.496
One of the issues they have now
is white bark pine die-off.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.016
White bark pine

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.056
I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora
