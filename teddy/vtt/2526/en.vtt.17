00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.535
And in a further irony,
these places that we love the most

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.256
are the places that we love
a little too hard, sometimes.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.696
A lot of us like to go there,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.256
and because we're managing
them to be stable

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.336
in the face of a changing planet,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.760
they often are becoming
more fragile over time.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.896
Which means that they're
the absolute worst places

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.856
to take your children on vacation,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.776
because you can't do anything there.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.096
You can't climb the trees.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.336
You can't fish the fish.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.976
You can't make a campfire
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.656
You can't take home the pinecones.
