00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.656
And look at this empty lot.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.456
I mean, there's, like, probably,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.416
a dozen, minimum,
plant species growing there,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.696
supporting all kinds of insect life,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.056
and this is a completely unmanaged space,
a completely wild space.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.056
This is a kind of wild nature
right under our nose,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.560
that we don't even notice.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.976
And there's an interesting
little paradox, too.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.816
So this nature,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.496
this kind of wild, untended part

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.296
of our urban, peri-urban,
suburban agricultural existence

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.696
that flies under the radar,
