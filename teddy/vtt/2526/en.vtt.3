00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.176
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,
but I think it's a helpful way

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.880
to think about the magnitude
of human influence on the planet.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.496
So where does this put nature?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
What counts as nature in a world
where everything is influenced by humans?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.576
So 25 years ago, environmental writer
Bill McKibben said

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.096
that because nature
was a thing apart from man

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.696
and because climate change meant

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.336
that every centimeter of the Earth
was altered by man,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.456
then nature was over.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.840
In fact, he called his book
"The End of Nature."
