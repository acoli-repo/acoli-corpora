00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.936
you can look over the side

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.216
and you can see a local playground
for a local school,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.176
and that's what it looks like.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.216
These children have, that --

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.696
You know, under my definition,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.096
there's a lot of the planet
that counts as nature,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.456
but this would be one of the few places
that wouldn't count as nature.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.856
There's nothing there except humans,
no other plants, no other animals.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.336
And what I really wanted to do

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.456
was just, like,
throw a ladder over the side

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.016
and get all these kids to come up with me
into this cool meadow.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.336
In a way, I feel like this is
the choice that faces us.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.960
If we dismiss these new natures
as not acceptable or trashy or no good,
