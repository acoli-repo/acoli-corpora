00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.376
And of course, we've changed
the chemistry of the air.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.256
So when you take your next breath,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.136
you'll be breathing in
42 percent more carbon dioxide

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.360
than if you were breathing in 1750.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.736
So all of these changes, and many others,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.840
have come to be kind of lumped together
under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.016
And this is a term
that some geologists are suggesting

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.856
we should give to our current epoch,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.640
given how pervasive
human influence has been over it.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.176
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,
but I think it's a helpful way
