I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.736
that grows up at high altitude --

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.736
and it's got all these problems
right now with disease.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.896
There's a blister rust
that was introduced,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.416
bark beetle.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.016
So to deal with this,
the park service has been planting

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.760
rust-resistant white bark
pine seedlings in the park,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.600
even in areas that they are
otherwise managing as wilderness.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.016
And they're also putting out
beetle repellent in key areas

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.920
as I saw last time I went hiking there.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.976
And this kind of thing is really
much more common than you would think.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.696
National parks are heavily managed.
