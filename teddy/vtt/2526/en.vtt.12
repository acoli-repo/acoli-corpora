00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.656
if all of those actually give us
a result where we don't have any nature,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.096
then maybe they're the wrong definitions.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.616
Maybe we should define it
by the presence of multiple species,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.680
by the presence of a thriving life.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.456
Now, if we do it that way,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.936
what do we get?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.336
Well, it's this kind of miracle.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.640
All of a sudden,
there's nature all around us.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.856
All of a sudden,
we see this Monarch caterpillar

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.736
munching on this plant,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.576
and we realize that there it is,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.400
and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
