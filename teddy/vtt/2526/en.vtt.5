00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.776
anywhere where there are
multiple species together,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.016
anywhere that's green and blue
and thriving and filled with life

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.240
and growing.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.496
And under that definition,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.056
things look a little bit different.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.776
Now, I understand that there
are certain parts of this nature

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.416
that speak to us in a special way.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.096
Places like Yellowstone,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.816
or the Mongolian steppe,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.176
or the Great Barrier Reef

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.696
or the Serengeti.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.736
Places that we think of
as kind of Edenic representations

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.360
of a nature before
we screwed everything up.
