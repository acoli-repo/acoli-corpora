00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.976
that led to the extinction
of a big slew of large-bodied animals,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.256
from the mastodon
to the giant ground sloth,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.536
saber-toothed cats,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.176
all of these cool animals
that unfortunately are no longer with us.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.016
And when those animals went extinct,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.616
you know, the ecosystems
didn't stand still.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.256
Massive ripple effects
changed grasslands into forests,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.080
changed the composition of forest
from one tree to another.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.656
So even in these Edens,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.496
even in these perfect-looking places

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.016
that seem to remind us
of a past before humans,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.120
we're essentially looking
at a humanized landscape.
