of a nature before
we screwed everything up.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.576
And in a way, they are less impacted
by our day to day activities.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.296
Many of these places
have no roads or few roads,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.896
so on, like such.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.696
But ultimately, even these Edens
are deeply influenced by humans.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.976
Now, let's just take
North America, for example,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.616
since that's where we're meeting.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.056
So between about 15,000 years ago
when people first came here,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.576
they started a process
of interacting with the nature

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.976
that led to the extinction
of a big slew of large-bodied animals,
