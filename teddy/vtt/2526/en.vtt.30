If we have a generation
that doesn't know how to build a fort,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.976
we'll have a generation that doesn't
know how to care about nature.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.256
And I don't want
to be the one to tell this kid,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.616
who is on a special program

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.096
that takes Philadelphia kids
from poor neighborhoods

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.536
and takes them to city parks,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.736
I don't want to be the one to tell him
that the flower he's holding

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.840
is a non-native invasive weed
that he should throw away as trash.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.936
I think I would much rather
learn from this boy

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.616
that no matter
where this plant comes from,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.816
it is beautiful, and it deserves
to be touched and appreciated.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.056
Thank you.
