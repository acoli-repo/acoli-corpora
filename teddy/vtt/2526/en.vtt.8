00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.120
we're essentially looking
at a humanized landscape.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.536
Not just these prehistoric humans,
but historical humans, indigenous people

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.800
all the way up until the moment
when the first colonizers showed up.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.256
And the case is the same
for the other continents as well.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.096
Humans have just been involved in nature

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.000
in a very influential way
for a very long time.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.216
Now, just recently, someone told me,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.096
"Oh, but there are still wild places."

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.336
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.256
And he said, "The Amazon."

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.736
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon.
I was just there.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.896
It's awesome. National Geographic
sent me to Manú National Park,
