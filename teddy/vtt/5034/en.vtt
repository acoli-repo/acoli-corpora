It was a normal Tuesday 
at the superconductor,

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:14.161
until a bug in the system created 
a small situation.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.900
Now your team is trapped in eleven 
separate pocket dimensions.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.380
Luckily for you, thereâ€™s a half-finished 
experimental teleportation robot

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.718
that may be able to get you all home,

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:30.838
if you can figure out how to work through
the quirks of its design.
