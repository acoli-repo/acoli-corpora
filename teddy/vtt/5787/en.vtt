(Video) Severn Cullis-Suzuki: I am here 
to speak for all generations to come.

00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:09.826
I am here to speak on behalf
of the starving children around the world

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.683
whose cries go unheard.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.409
I'm here to speak
for the countless animals

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.034
dying across this planet

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.433
because they have nowhere left to go.

(Video) SCS: I am afraid 
to go out in the sun now

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.225

I'm afraid to breathe the air,

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:31.600
because I don't know
what chemicals are in it.
