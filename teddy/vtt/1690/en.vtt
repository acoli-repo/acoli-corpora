00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:03.557
Throughout the history of computers

00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:06.804
we've been striving
to shorten the gap between us

00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:08.398
and digital information,

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:10.232
the gap between our physical world

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:12.030
and the world in the screen

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.872
where our imagination can go wild.

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:18.799
And this gap has become shorter,

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:21.564
shorter, and even shorter,

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.208
and now this gap is shortened down

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:24.518
to less than a millimeter,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.396
the thickness of a touch-screen glass,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.846
and the power of computing

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.749
has become accessible to everyone.
