00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.166
We live in a world
where the collection of data

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.738
is happening 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.055
365 days a year.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.053
This data is usually collected by
what we call a front-desk specialist now.

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:16.197
These are the retail clerks
at your favorite department stores,

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.664
the cashiers at the grocery stores,

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.293
the registration specialists
at the hospital

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:24.431
and even the person that sold you
your last movie ticket.

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:28.783
They ask discreet questions, like:
"May I please have your zip code?"

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:31.918
Or, "Would you like to use
your savings card today?"
