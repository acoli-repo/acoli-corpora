You know you've got to bring food
to these meetings.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.482
(Laughter)

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:04.665
Anyway.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.197
(Laughter)

00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.990
Now, that was an example
of a healthcare setting,

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:12.347

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:15.513
True story: I was going
to wire some money.

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.720
And the customer service
representative asked me

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.078

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.800
Now, I hesitated to answer her question,

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:26.954
and before she even realized
why I hesitated,

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:29.993
she began to throw the company
she worked for under the bus.
