00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:02.188
Now I know that you
don't have to be a statistician

00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:05.213
to understand the power
and the purpose of data,

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:09.601
but you do have to treat people
with respect and have compassionate care.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:12.450
Now I know that when you've been graced,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.850
it is your responsibility
to empower somebody else.

00:07:15.874 --> 00:07:18.299
But most importantly, now I know

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:20.736
that when teaching human beings

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.839
to communicate with other human beings,

00:07:23.863 --> 00:07:27.648
it should be delivered by a human being.

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:34.909
