00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:31.232
to discriminate against them,

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:33.647
all because of how you presented
the information.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.449
And at that point, we get bad data.

00:03:35.473 --> 00:03:37.584
And everybody knows what bad data does.

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:40.401
Bad data costs you time,
it costs you money

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:42.371
and it costs you resources.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:44.958
Unfortunately, when you have bad data,

00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:48.061
it also costs you a lot more,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.480
because we have health disparities,

00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:52.718
and we have social determinants of health,

00:03:52.742 --> 00:03:54.400
and we have the infant mortality,

00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:57.067
all of which depends
on the data that we collect,

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.339
and if we have bad data,
than we have those issues still.
