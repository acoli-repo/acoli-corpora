00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:31.918
Or, "Would you like to use
your savings card today?"

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.678
All of which gives us data.

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:39.289
However, the conversation
becomes a little bit more complex

00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:42.631
when the more difficult questions
need to be asked.

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:44.448
Let me tell you a story, see.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.768
Once upon a time, there was
a woman named Miss Margaret.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:49.943
Miss Margaret had been
a front-desk specialist

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.427
for almost 20 years.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.268
And in all that time, she has never,
and I do mean never,

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:58.812
had to ask a patient their gender,
race or ethnicity.

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:02.059
Because, see, now Miss Margaret
has the ability to just look at you.
