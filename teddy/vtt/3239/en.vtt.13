00:06:26.847 --> 00:06:30.791
Because now I know
that when you engage people in the why,

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:34.291
it challenges their perspective,
and it changes their attitudes.

00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:37.474
Now I know that data
that we have at the front desk

00:06:37.498 --> 00:06:42.311
translates into research that eliminates
disparities and finds cures.

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:46.041
Now I know that teaching people
transitional change

00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:48.911
instead of shocking them into change

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:52.190
is always a better way
of implementing change.

00:06:52.214 --> 00:06:55.260
See, now I know people are more likely
to share information

00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:59.143
when they are treated with respect
by knowledgeable staff members.

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:02.188
Now I know that you
don't have to be a statistician
