00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.339
and if we have bad data,
than we have those issues still.

00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:02.262
And we have underprivileged populations

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:05.077
that remain unfortunate
and underprivileged,

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:09.027
because the data that we're using
is either outdated,

00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:12.344
or is not good at all
or we don't have anything at all.

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:15.623
Now, wouldn't it be amazing
if people like Miss Margaret

00:04:15.647 --> 00:04:18.797
and the customer-service
representative at the wiring place

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.195
were graced to collect data
with compassionate care?

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:25.879
Can I explain to you
what I mean by "graced?"

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:27.990
I wrote an acrostic poem.
