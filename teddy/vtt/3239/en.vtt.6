00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.415
but lacked the ability
to ask their questions properly

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.974
and unfortunately, that made her look bad,

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.244
but the worst, that made
the business look even worse

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:09.934
than how she was looking.

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.003
Because she had no idea who I was.

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:15.712

00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:24.331
And unfortunately,

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:27.250
what happens is people would decline
to answer the questions,

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.783
because they feel like
you would use the information

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:31.232
to discriminate against them,
