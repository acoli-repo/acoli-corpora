00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.695
Right when I was 15 was when
I first got interested in solar energy.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.576
My family had moved from Fort Lee,
New Jersey to California,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.936
from the snow to lots of heat,
and gas lines.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.336
There was gas rationing in 1973.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.416
The energy crisis was in full bore.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.576
I started reading
"Popular Science" magazine,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.456
and I got really excited
about the potential of solar energy

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.216
to try and solve that crisis.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.376
I had just taken
trigonometry in high school,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.776
I learned about the parabola

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.696
and how it could concentrate
rays of light to a single focus.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.296
That got me very excited.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.536
And I really felt
