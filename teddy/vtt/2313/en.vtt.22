WEBVTT

00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.801
and we want to participate in that, and want

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:03.241
people to participate in it in an informed way.

00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:05.152
So there are things,

00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:06.602
let me talk there a little bit more,

00:11:06.602 --> 00:11:10.371
there are things that we need
to be transparent about:

00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:12.398
our authorities, our processes,

00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:14.452
our oversight, who we are.

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:16.218
We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.606
and I think that's part of the reason

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:20.335
that this has been so revelational

00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.531
and so sensational in the media.

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.657
Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.

00:11:26.657 --> 00:11:29.306
There's takeoffs of our logo

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:32.325
of an eagle with headphones on around it.
