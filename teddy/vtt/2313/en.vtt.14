00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.853
The net effect of that is that our people

00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:03.746
who are overseas in dangerous places,

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.610
whether they're diplomats or military,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.201
and our allies who are in similar situations,

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.060
are at greater risk because we don't see

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.011
the threats that are coming their way.

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.070
CA: So that's a general response saying that

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.167
because of his revelations,

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.033
access that you had to certain types of information

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:24.604
has been shut down, has been closed down.

00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:28.153
But the concern is that the nature of that access

00:07:28.153 --> 00:07:31.857
was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.
