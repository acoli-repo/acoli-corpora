00:09:27.912 --> 00:09:31.525
are secure for their intended purposes.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:33.474
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:37.219
when it comes to the Internet at large,

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:39.846
any strategy is fair game

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.762
if it improves America's safety.

00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:44.820
And I think this is partly where there is such

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.205
a divide of opinion,

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:47.455
that there's a lot of people in this room

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:48.828
and around the world

00:09:48.828 --> 00:09:50.478
who think very differently about the Internet.

00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:53.465
They think of it as a momentous

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:55.063
invention of humanity,

00:09:55.063 --> 00:09:58.227
kind of on a par with the
Gutenberg press, for example.

00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:00.682
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.
