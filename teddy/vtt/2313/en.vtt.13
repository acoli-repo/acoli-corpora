00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:34.568
in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.356
So the unconstrained disclosure 
of those capabilities

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.640
means that as adversaries see them

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.003
and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.570
they move away from that,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.779
and we have seen targets in terrorism,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.911
in the nation-state area,

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.913
in smugglers of various types, and other folks

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:53.866
who have, because of the disclosures,

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.801
moved away from our ability

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.889
to have insight into what they're doing.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.853
The net effect of that is that our people
