WEBVTT

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.024
Otherwise, if we could make it so that

00:08:31.024 --> 00:08:33.210
all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.166
we could have a domain, badguy.com.

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.660
That would be awesome,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.802
and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.

00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:40.134
That's not how it works.

00:08:40.134 --> 00:08:42.345
They're trying to hide

00:08:42.345 --> 00:08:44.150
from the government's ability

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.433
to isolate and interdict their actions,

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:50.245
and so we have to swim in that same space.

00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:51.847
But I will tell you this.

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.326
So NSA has two missions.

00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:54.776
One is the Signals Intelligence mission

00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:58.403
that we've unfortunately read so
much about in the press.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.141
The other one is the Information Assurance mission,
