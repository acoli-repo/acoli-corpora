RL: I do understand that, and I actually share
the view of the utility of the Internet,

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:31.971
and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.

00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:34.382

The Internet is a big chunk of

And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,

00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.801
and we want to participate in that, and want
