00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.141
The other one is the Information Assurance mission,

00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:03.052
which is to protect the national security
systems of the United States,

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:05.020
and by that, that's things like

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.036
the communications that the president uses,

00:09:07.036 --> 00:09:09.641
the communications that
control our nuclear weapons,

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:11.910
the communications that our
military uses around the world,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.401
and the communications that we use with our allies,

00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.125
and that some of our allies themselves use.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:21.962
And so we make recommendations
on standards to use,

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.789
and we use those same standards,

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:25.667
and so we are invested

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.912
in making sure that those communications

00:09:27.912 --> 00:09:31.525
are secure for their intended purposes.
