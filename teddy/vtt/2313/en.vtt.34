00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.928
Metadata is the information that lets you

00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:05.319
find connections that people are trying to hide.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.330
So when a terrorist is corresponding

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.175
with somebody else who's not known to us

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.783
but is engaged in doing or
supporting terrorist activity,

00:17:11.783 --> 00:17:14.209
or someone who's violating international sanctions

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:17.286
by providing nuclear weapons-related material

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.612
to a country like Iran or North Korea,

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:23.189
is trying to hide that activity
because it's illicit activity.

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:25.999
What metadata lets you do is connect that.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:27.531
The alternative to that

00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.150
is one that's much less efficient

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.531
and much more invasive of privacy,
