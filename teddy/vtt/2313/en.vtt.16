00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:00.946
it's the most complex system ever devised by man,

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.593
and it is a wonder,

00:08:02.593 --> 00:08:04.197
and lots of folks in the room there

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.548
are responsible for the creation

00:08:06.548 --> 00:08:07.917
and enhancement of that,

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:10.790
and it's just a wonderful thing.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.287
But it's also used by people who are

And so if I'm going to pursue them,

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.484
I need to have the capability

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:21.659
to go after them,

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:24.485
and again, the controls are in

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:27.006
how I apply that capability,

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.252
not that I have the capability itself.

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.024
Otherwise, if we could make it so that
