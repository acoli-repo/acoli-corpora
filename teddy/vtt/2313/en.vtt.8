00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:02.648
the avenues that would have been available
to him as an employee weren't available,

00:04:02.648 --> 00:04:06.079
two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.690
like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.837
pretty harshly, by some views,

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.490
and thirdly, what he was taking on

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.827
was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:18.798
but programs that had been approved

00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:21.739
by all three branches of government.

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.538
I mean, in that circumstance,

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:26.941
couldn't you argue that what he did

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:29.207
was reasonable?

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:31.520
RL: No, I don't agree with that.
