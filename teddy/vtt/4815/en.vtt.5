00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.969
which disable sperm while also making
egg implantation in the uterus difficult.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.284
Block, disable, or suppress:

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.626
is one strategy better than the other?

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:40.884
There are differences, but a lot of it
has to do with how convenient

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:44.214
and easy it is to use 
each contraceptive correctly.

00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:48.064
For example, male condoms would be
about 98% effective

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:50.055
if everyone used them perfectly.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:55.056
That 98% means if 100 couples correctly
used condoms for a year,

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:57.475
two women would get pregnant.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:02.845
But not everyone uses them correctly,
so they're only 82% effective in practice.
