Here's what has to happen for pregnancy
to occur after sexual intercourse.

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.681
Sperm must swim up the vagina,

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.081
through the cervical opening,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.571
upwards through the uterus,

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.211
and into one of the two fallopian tubes.

00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.420
If an egg, released during 
that month's ovulation, is in the tube,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.571
one sperm has a chance to fertilize it.

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.489
Contraceptives are designed
to prevent this process,

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.671
and they work in three basic ways.
