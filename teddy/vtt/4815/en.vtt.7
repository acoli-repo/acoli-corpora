00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:30.526
Hormonal methods in particular
can cause symptoms like headaches,

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:31.356
nausea,

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:32.968
and high blood pressure,

00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:35.056
but they vary from woman to woman.

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:38.606
That's why these methods
require a prescription from a doctor.

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:41.486
The choice of contraceptive method
is a personal one,

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.725
and what works best for you now
may change later.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.477
Scientists also continue to research
new methods,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:51.306
such as a male pill that would
prevent sperm production.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:53.766
In the meantime, 
there are quite a few options

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.116
to block sperm,

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.136
disable them,

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:59.096
or suppress eggs
and keep them out of reach.
