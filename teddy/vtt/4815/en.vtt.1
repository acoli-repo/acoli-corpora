00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.671
and they work in three basic ways.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.771
They block the sperm,

00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.630
disable sperm 
before they reach the uterus,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.944
or suppress ovulation.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:41.683
Block is the simplest.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:45.080
Male and female condoms prevent
sperm from coming into contact

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.171
with the vaginal space.

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:50.871
That barrier is also why they,
unlike other contraceptive methods,

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:55.441
are able to prevent transmission
of certain sexually transmitted diseases.

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.534
Meanwhile, the diaphragm, 
cervical cap, and sponge

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:04.632
work by being placed over the cervix,
barricading the entrance to the uterus.
