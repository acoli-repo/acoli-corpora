00:01:53.982 --> 00:02:00.073
all release synthetic versions of various
combinations of progesterone and estrogen.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:02.613
This hormone cocktail 
suppresses ovulation,

00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:06.233
keeping the immature egg
safely sequestered in the ovary.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.253
Synthetic progesterone also has a block
trick up its sleeve.

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:14.644
It makes cervical mucus too thick and
sticky for sperm to swim through easily.

00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:18.354
There are other contraceptives that
use multiple approaches at the same time.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:22.955
For example, many IUDs,
or intrauterine devices,

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.164
contain synthetic hormones 
which suppress ovulation.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.333
Some also contain copper,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.969
which disable sperm while also making
egg implantation in the uterus difficult.
