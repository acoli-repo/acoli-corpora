Concrete is the second
most used substance on earth after water,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.063
and for this reason,

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:09.966
it has a significant environmental impact.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.590
If it were a country, it would rank third
for emissions after China and USA.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.015
But in fact, concrete
is an intrinsically low-impact material

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.868
with much lower emissions
of CO2 and energy per ton

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:28.582
than other materials like iron and steel,
even things like bricks.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.176
But because of the enormous
volumes we use overall,
