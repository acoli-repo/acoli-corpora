Here is [Duccio],

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.574
and here is Michelangelo.

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:08.309
My concern is: Are we
one-noting the genders

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:13.058
in our narratives of poverty
in developing communities?

00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:17.653
Do we have women as victims,
and are men only the perpetrators?

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:20.961
Are they the guys with the AK-47s
or the boy soldiers?

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:23.734
Because that doesn't leave
room for stories

00:08:23.758 --> 00:08:28.610
like the man who's selling ice cream
at the refuge camp in Southern Sudan,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:29.923
where we did a project,

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:35.404
or the stories of the men who are working
on the bridge over the Blue Nile.
