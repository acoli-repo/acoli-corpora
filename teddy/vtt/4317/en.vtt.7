And I said to her,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.922
"I was looking forward
to going to developing countries

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:38.589
and doing research and covering stories
at the same time."

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.697
She said, "I don't think so, girlfriend."

00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:47.272
And that confusion, that mutual confusion,
drove us to publish a paper

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:50.800
on the conflicting ethics
and the contradictory practices

00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:52.389
of research and reporting.

00:03:52.413 --> 00:03:54.446
We started with the understanding

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.719
that researchers and reporters
are distant cousins,

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.861
equally storytellers and social analysts.
