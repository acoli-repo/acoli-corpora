I don't want to just pick on our friends
in the gaming arts;

00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:31.866
I'll turn to the graphic arts,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.599
where we often see these monolithic,
homogeneous stories

00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:40.389
about the great country of Africa.

00:09:41.943 --> 00:09:45.185
But Africa is not a country,
it's a continent.

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:49.330
It's 54 countries and thousands
and thousands of languages.

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.534
So my question is:
Is this imagery productive,

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:55.350
or is it reductive?

00:09:55.374 --> 00:09:57.311

USAID just launched
their campaign "Forward" --
