that photographs, in part, help define
what we have the right to observe,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.577
but more importantly,

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.505
they are an ethics of seeing.

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:10.349
And I think right now is a good time
to review our ethics of seeing,

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:14.209
as our industries of reporting
and research and NGO work

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.053
are collapsing and changing,

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.936
in part, by what's being driven by
what's happening in the economy.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.297
But it's making us forge
new relationships.

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.562
And those new relationships
have some fuzzy boundaries.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.290
I worked at the edge
of some of these fuzzy boundaries,

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.289
and I want to share with you
some of my observations.
