particularly for those of us in industries
who are portraying people

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.610
in poor countries,

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.031
in developing countries

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.433
and portraying the poor.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.150

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:52.768
or the hungry

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:54.343
or the child laborers

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.094
or the exotic.

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.145
Now, Susan Sontag reminds us

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:03.105
that photographs, in part, help define
what we have the right to observe,
