NGOs understand the benefits
of having reporters tag along

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.999
on their team.

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:35.799
They need the publicity,
they are under tremendous pressure,

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:39.777
they're competing in a very crowded
market for compassion.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.572
So they're also looking to reporters
and to hire freelance reporters

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.244
to help them develop
their public relations material

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:48.186
and their media material.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.718
Now, researchers are also under pressure.

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:56.192
They're under pressure to communicate
their science outside of the academy.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:59.788
So they're collaborating with reporters,
because for many researchers,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:04.265
it's difficult for them
to write a simple story or a clear story.
