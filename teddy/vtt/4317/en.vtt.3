00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.289
and I want to share with you
some of my observations.

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:37.145
My ethics of seeing is informed
by 25 years as a reporter

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.204
covering emerging economies
and international relations.

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:43.709
And I believe in a free
and independent press.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.781
I believe that journalism
is a public good.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.170
But it's getting harder to do that job,

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:51.329
in part, because of the massive layoffs,

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.006
because the budgets for international
reporting aren't there anymore,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.674
new technologies and new platforms
begging new content,

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:01.296
and there are a lot of new journalisms.
