Researchers are mandated to acquire
document-informed consent.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.921
Well, as a reporter, if I hang
a microphone on someone,

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.218
that is consent.

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:40.693
And when it comes to creating the story,
I'll fact-check as a reporter,

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.945
but I don't invite company
to create that story,

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.979
whereas social scientists, researchers,

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:48.307
and particularly
participatory researchers,

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:52.286
will often work on constructing
the narrative with the community.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.468
And when it comes
to paying for information,

00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:58.616
"checkbook journalism"
is roundly discouraged,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.891
in part, because of the bias it introduces
in the kind of information you get.
