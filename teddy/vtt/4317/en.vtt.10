It's more of a time stamp,
it's a documentation of research.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.379
I couldn't use this for news.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:10.177
It doesn't tell enough,
and it wouldn't sell.

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:12.780
But then, the differences
are even deeper than that.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:17.865
Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates
that researchers are under.

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.575
They are under some very strict rules

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.084
governed by their university
research review boards

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:26.682
when it comes to content
and confidentiality.

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:32.021
Researchers are mandated to acquire
document-informed consent.
