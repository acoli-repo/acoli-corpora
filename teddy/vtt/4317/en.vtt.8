00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.861
equally storytellers and social analysts.

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:05.982
But we don't see nor portray
developing communities the same way.

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:10.568
Here's a very classic example.
This is Somalia, 1992.

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:12.402
It could be Somalia today.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.862
And this is a standard operating procedure

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:18.217
for much of the news video
and the news pictures that you see,

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:21.085
where a group of reporters
will be trucked in,

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.706
escorted to the site of a disaster,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.254
they'll produce their material,
take their pictures, get their interviews,

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:28.893
and then they'll be escorted out.

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:31.574
This is decidedly not a research setting.
