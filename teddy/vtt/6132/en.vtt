Some years ago, I was visiting Paris

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:07.904
and walking along the Seine River
during a beautiful summer afternoon.

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:11.177
I saw giant bubbles
floating on the riverbank,

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:12.612
like this one.

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:15.589
The next moment, it popped and was gone.

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:20.289
Making them were two street performers
surrounded by a crowd.

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:24.244
They visibly make a living
by asking for donations

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:28.128
and by selling pairs of sticks
tied with two strings.

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:33.219
When I was there, a man bought
a pair of sticks for 10 euros,
