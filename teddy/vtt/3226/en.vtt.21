you need creativity --

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.096
(Laughter)

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.336
thank you --

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.496
to come up with an image like that.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.776
But then you need to step back

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.920

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.616
And for that, I started
an exercise for myself

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.856
which I call Sunday sketching,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.976
which meant, on a Sunday, I would take
a random object I found around the house

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.416
and try to see if that object
could trigger an idea
