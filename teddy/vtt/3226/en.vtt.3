Now, what drawings can do
is they cannot only communicate images,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.016
they can even evoke emotions.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.336
Let's say you get to
an unfamiliar place and you see this.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.936
You feel happiness and relief.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.736
(Laughter)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.176
Or a slight sense of unease
or maybe downright panic.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.736
(Laughter)

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.216
Or blissful peace and quiet.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.856
(Laughter)

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.320
But visuals, they're of course
more than just graphic icons.
