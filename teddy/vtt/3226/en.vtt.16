(Applause)

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.056
When is a visual cliché good or bad?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.896
It's a fine line.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.216
And it really depends on the story.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.976
In 2011, during the earthquake
and the tsunami in Japan,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.176
I was thinking of a cover.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.656
And I went through the classic symbols:

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.976
the Japanese flag,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.360
"The Great Wave" by Hokusai,
one of the greatest drawings ever.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.136
And then the story changed

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.320
when the situation at the power plant
in Fukushima got out of hand.
