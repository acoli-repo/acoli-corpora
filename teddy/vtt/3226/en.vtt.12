Now, once we have reduced an image
to a more simple form,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.200
all sorts of new connections
become possible.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.536
And that allows for totally
new angles in storytelling.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.936
(Laughter)

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.416
And so, what I like to do is,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.640
I like to take images from really remote
cultural areas and bring them together.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.376
Now, with more daring references --

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.056
(Laughter)

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.800
I can have more fun.
