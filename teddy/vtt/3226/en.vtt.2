00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.496
But nobody ever taught you how this works,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.760
you just know it.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.376
College, shopping, music.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.176
What makes a language powerful
is that you can take a very complex idea

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080
and communicate it
in a very simple, efficient form.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.960
These images represent
exactly the same ideas.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.096
But when you look, for example,
at the college hat,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.536
you know that this doesn't represent
the accessory you wear on your head

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.416
when you're being handed your diploma,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.240
but rather the whole idea of college.
