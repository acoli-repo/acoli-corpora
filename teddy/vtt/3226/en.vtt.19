"Oh, it's the background
blurry upside-down,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.696
contained in a sharp image."

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.596
And I thought, wow, that's really cool,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.986
and I have absolutely no idea
what to do with that.

00:09:36.016 --> 00:09:38.176
A while later, I'm back in New York,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.560
and I draw this image of being stuck
on the Brooklyn bridge in a traffic jam.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.600
It's really annoying,
but also kind of poetic.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.216
And only later I realized,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.520
I can take both of these ideas
and put them together in this idea.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.880
And what I want to do
is not show a realistic scene.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.736
But, maybe like poetry,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.216
make you aware that you
already had this image with you,
