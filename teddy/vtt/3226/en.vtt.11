00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.816
So you take a symbol, any symbol,
for example the heart and the arrow,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.656
which most of us would read
as the symbol for love,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.496
and I'm an artist, so I can draw this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.480
in any given degree
of realism or abstraction.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.696
Now, if I go too realistic on it,
it just grosses everybody out.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.736
(Laughter)

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.696
If I go too far on the other side
and do very abstract,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.976
nobody has any idea
what they're looking at.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.376
So I have to find
the perfect place on that scale,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.440
in this case it's somewhere in the middle.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.840
Now, once we have reduced an image
to a more simple form,
