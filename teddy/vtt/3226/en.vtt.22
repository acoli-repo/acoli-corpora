00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.416
and try to see if that object
could trigger an idea

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.360
that had nothing to do
with the original purpose of that item.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
And it usually just means
I'm blank for a long while.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.696
And the only trick that eventually works
is if I open my mind

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.056
and run through every image
I have stored up there,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.640
and see if something clicks.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.016
And if it does, just add
a few lines of ink to connect --

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.960
to preserve this very short
moment of inspiration.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.496
And the great lesson there
