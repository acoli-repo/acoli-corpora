00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.096
I even started a side career
that consists entirely

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.936
of complaining about the difficulty
of the creative process.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.056
(Laughter)

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.840
But today, I don't want to talk
about what makes my life difficult.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.096
I want to talk about what makes it easy.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.616
And that is you --

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.296
and the fact that
you are fluent in a language

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.178
that you're probably not even aware of.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.560
You're fluent in the language
of reading images.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.176
Deciphering an image like that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.256
takes quite a bit
of an intellectual effort.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.496
But nobody ever taught you how this works,
