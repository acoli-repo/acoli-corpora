00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.936
And the idea is, that instead
of drawing the actual object,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.976
you draw the space around it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.400
So the bowls in this drawing are empty.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.240
But the black ink prompts your brain
to project food into a void.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.360
What we see here is not a owl flying.

00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:50.256
What we actually see
is a pair of AA batteries

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.456
standing on a nonsensical drawing,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.016
and I animate the scene
by moving my desk lamp up and down.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.096
(Laughter)

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.720
The image really only exists in your mind.
