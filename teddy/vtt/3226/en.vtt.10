The image really only exists in your mind.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.760
So, how much information do we need
to trigger such an image?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.120
My goal as an artist
is to use the smallest amount possible.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.936
I try to achieve a level of simplicity

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.376
where, if you were to take away
one more element,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.440
the whole concept would just collapse.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.160
And that's why my personal favorite tool
as an artist is abstraction.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.536
I've come up with this system
which I call the abstract-o-meter,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.896
and this is how it works.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.816
So you take a symbol, any symbol,
for example the heart and the arrow,
