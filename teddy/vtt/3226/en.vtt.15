00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.136
towards a small set
of really tired visual clichés

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.776
that are considered safe.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.776
You know, it's the businessman
climbing up a ladder,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.896
and then the ladder moves,
morphs into a stock market graph,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.336
and anything with dollar signs;
that's always good.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.976
(Laughter)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.816
If there are editorial decision makers
here in the audience,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.616
I want to give you a piece of advice.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.536
Every time a drawing
like this is published,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.416
a baby panda will die.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.536
(Laughter)

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.776
Literally.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.136
(Laughter)

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.736
(Applause)
