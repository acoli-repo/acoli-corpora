But if you do, you might
even appreciate the small detail,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.496
like the beer-can pattern here
on the bottom of the vase.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.200
(Laughter)

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.736
A recurring discussion I have
with magazine editors,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.736
who are usually word people,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.360
is that their audience, you,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.896
are much better at making
radical leaps with images

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.640
than they're being given credit for.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.536
And the only thing I find frustrating
is that they often seem to push me

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.136
towards a small set
of really tired visual clichés
