00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.496
the only thing that makes sleeping
even more complicated

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.216
than trying to do it on an airplane

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.800
is when you have small children.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080
They show up at your bed at around 4am

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.256
with some bogus excuse of,
"I had a bad dream."

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.536
(Laughter)

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.506
And then, of course you feel
sorry for them, they're your kids,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.946
so you let them into your bed.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.675
And I have to admit, at the beginning,
they're really cute and warm and snugly.

00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:54.856
The minute you fall back asleep,
they inexplicably --

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.536
(Laughter)

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.816
start rotating.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.416
(Laughter)
