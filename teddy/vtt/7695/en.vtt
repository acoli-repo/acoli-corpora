00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:02.636
When I was in my early 30s,

00:00:02.676 --> 00:00:05.356
I was an associate
at a Wall Street law firm.

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:09.436
And I had been working 16-hour days
for seven years straight.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.636
And even though,
ever since I was four years old,

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:15.876
I'd had this beautiful
and impossible dream

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.716
of becoming a writer,

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:22.316
I was also pretty ambitious
and on the verge of making partner.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.996
Or so I thought.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:27.236
Because, one day, a senior partner
named Steve Shalen

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:29.476
knocked on my office door.

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:32.796
Steve was tall and distinguished
and very decent.
