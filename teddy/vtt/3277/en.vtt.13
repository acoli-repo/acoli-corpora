00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.050
And we asked them,
"If you had a hundred dollars,

00:06:30.074 --> 00:06:33.189
how would you spend it
to buy health in your community?

00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:37.842
Turns out, they agree
nearly to the last percentage point.

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:42.617
First, they agree that health care
only sort of impacts health.

00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:45.186
So they choose to spend
the majority of their dollars

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.033
outside of hospitals and clinics.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:50.768
And second, they agree
on what creates health,

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.017
spending 19 percent on affordable housing

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:55.938
and about 25 percent
on access to healthy food.

00:06:56.868 --> 00:07:00.364
So I am sure you are thinking,
"This has got to be a fluke."
