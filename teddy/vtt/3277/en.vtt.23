00:11:28.043 --> 00:11:30.488
or will you act on what your voters,

00:11:30.512 --> 00:11:33.402
what Democratic
and Republican voters alike,

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.817
already know,

00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:38.193
which is that good wages,
healthy food and safe housing

00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:39.382
are health?

00:11:39.997 --> 00:11:44.107
And for the rest of us,
for the citizens of this country:

00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:48.457
Will we demand accountability
to what we know to be true,

00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:50.667
which is that our common sense,

00:11:50.691 --> 00:11:52.511
our common experience,

00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:55.926
makes us the experts
in what it takes to be healthy?

00:11:57.123 --> 00:11:59.755
This moment, as it turns out,

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.877
is not about changing minds.
