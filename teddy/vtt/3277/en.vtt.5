00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:33.060
So two decades later, what's changed?

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:37.069
It's now widely recognized
that just 20 percent of health outcomes

00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:39.093
are tied to medical care,

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:44.177
whereas up to 70 percent
are tied to healthy behaviors

00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:47.676
and what's called the social
determinants of health --

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.815
basically, everything that happens to us
for that vast majority of time

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.842
when we're not in the doctor's office

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.406
or the hospital.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.915
Health care executives
now routinely remind us

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.417
that our zip code matters more
than our genetic code.
