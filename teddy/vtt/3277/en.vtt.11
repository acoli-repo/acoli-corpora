00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:31.293
We ask about and argue about health care,

00:05:31.317 --> 00:05:33.252
but how do voters think about health?

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:37.127
No one could tell us
the answer to that question,

00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:39.098
so we launched a new initiative

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:42.493
and hired a polling firm
to ask voters across the country:

00:05:42.517 --> 00:05:44.408
What do you need to be healthy?

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:52.183
What was so striking about this
was that no one has any clue

00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:54.659
what we are talking about in health care.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:58.071
Voters do not think
the social determinants of health

00:05:58.095 --> 00:05:59.708
is a feel-good phrase.
