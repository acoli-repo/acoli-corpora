00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.877
is not about changing minds.

00:12:02.632 --> 00:12:04.789
It is about something more powerful.

00:12:05.205 --> 00:12:07.779
It is about changing the questions we ask

00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:11.730

to hear each other's answers.

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:16.577

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:19.058

00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:20.498
we the health care executives

00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.586

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.532
And it is now time --

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:28.507
in fact, long overdue --

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:30.685
for us to marshal the courage
