00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:31.852
It turns out that when you have
the right language

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:34.268
and you ask the right questions,

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.905
the answers become remarkably clear

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:38.174
and unanimous.

00:10:41.055 --> 00:10:46.235
What we know is that,
despite all the noise,

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:49.407
the plan for health care in this country

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.011
is that there is no plan.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.176
But we have something more powerful
than any politician's bill,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.963
any candidate's platform,

00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:01.646
any think tank's policy statement.
