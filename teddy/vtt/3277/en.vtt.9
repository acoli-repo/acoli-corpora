00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:30.566
where doctors lament a hospital's
"no third sandwich policy,"

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.460
meaning that if you're
a hungry patient in the ER,

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:36.295
you can have only two free sandwiches,

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.036
but as many MRIs as the doctor orders;

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:43.299
where, in 2016 in the state of Texas,

00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:48.782
they spent 1.2 billion dollars
on the medical costs of malnutrition

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.361
instead of on access to healthy food;

00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:55.100
where a Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services program

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:57.547
stratifies hungry patients,

00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:02.796
so that some get access to food
and some get information about food,
