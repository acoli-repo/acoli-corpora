Rebecca Onie: But what if
underneath all the noise,

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.195
we're not divided?

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.876
What if the things that we don't ask about

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.248
are the things that we most agree upon?

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:41.485
It turns out that when we ask
the right questions,

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.978
the answers are startling,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:49.973
because we agree, not on health care,
but on something more important:

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:51.720
we agree on health.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:56.271
For 20 years, I've been obsessed
with one question:

00:00:56.295 --> 00:01:00.410
What do we, what do all of us need
in order to be healthy?
