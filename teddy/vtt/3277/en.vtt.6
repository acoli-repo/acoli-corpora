And one health care publication
even recently had the audacity

00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:08.423
to describe the social
determinants of health

00:03:08.447 --> 00:03:11.001
as "the feel-good buzzword of the year."

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:13.476
Now, there's been some action, too.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.379

recognizing that it reduces
infant mortality

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:28.149
and increases life expectancy.

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:30.762
But let's be honest.
