What do we, what do all of us need
in order to be healthy?

00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:03.093
As a college student in 1995,

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:07.858
I spent months talking to physicians
at a chaotic hospital in Boston,

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:12.898
asking them, "What's the one thing
your patients most need to be healthy?"

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.222

again and again,

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:19.547
one that I've heard hundreds
of variations of since.

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:23.456

with an asthma exacerbation,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.076
and I prescribe a controller medication.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.262
But I know she is living
in a mold-infested apartment.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.156
Or I see a kid with an ear infection,
and I prescribe antibiotics,
