In a study of 5,000 patients,

00:08:06.628 --> 00:08:10.912
24 percent of the patients
with commercial health insurance --

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:12.746
meaning, they had a job --

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.487
still ran out of food or struggled
to find housing or transportation

00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:19.518
or other essential resources.

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:21.057

in our focus groups.

00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:27.621
Nearly every voter knew
what it meant to struggle,

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:30.390
either themselves or their families
