00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.216
We call that the control role,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.976
to control fights in the group,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.376
and the second is to be the most empathic,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.320
the consoler in chief, basically,
of the nation, so to speak.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.736
So first of all, keeping the peace.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.696
This is a male who stops a fight
between two females.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.536
Two females on the left and the right

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.180
have been screaming and yelling
at each other over food,

00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:49.696
because food is very
important for the females,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.416
and so he stops the fight between them
and stands between them like this.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.631
And it's very interesting to me
that alpha males, when they do this,

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:57.895
they become impartial.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.056
They don't support their mom
or their best buddy.
