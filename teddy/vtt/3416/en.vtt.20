has just as high a level
as the lowest-ranking males,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.016
and so you may think that being alpha male
is nice and dandy and is wonderful,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.616

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.760

that physiologically.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.816
Now, what are the obligations?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.336
And here, for me,
it gets really interesting,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.600
and it deviates very much
from your typical image of the alpha male.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.120

has two sorts of obligations.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.736
One is to keep the peace in the group.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.216
We call that the control role,
