00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.056
and he lost his position because,
you know, chimpanzee males

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.936
they can spot from a mile away
if you are weak

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.336
and they went for him,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.336
and he lost his position,
and then he got sicker and sicker

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.256
until at some point we had to isolate him.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.016
The group lived on a grassy island,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.376
and we had to isolate him in a cage,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.216
but we cracked open the cage
so that the rest of the chimps

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.736
still had access to him.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.896
And what happened was most touching.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.696
Other chimps would bring food to him,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.656
they would bring wood wool to him,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.216
which is this thing that they use
to sleep in and build nests out of,
