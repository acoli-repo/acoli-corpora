00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.096
and we evolutionary biologists, of course,
we have an explanation for this,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.816
is that sex leads to reproduction,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.376
and reproductive success
is the measure of evolution.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.135
That's how everything evolves.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.936
And so if males can enhance
their reproductive success

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.376
by being high ranking,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.336
you get automatically the ambition
to be high ranking in the males.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.040
So that's the privilege.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.856
The costs, one cost is of course

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.936
that you need to keep your partners happy.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.816
So if you come to power
with the support of an old male,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.856
you need to let that old male
mate with females.
