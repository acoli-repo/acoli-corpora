Generally, it's a female
who is at the top of the community,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.536
and we know much less
about how this is done

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.416
and how they get to that position,
and what they do with it,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.296
because we know much less
about bonobos in general.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.656
But I do want to emphasize

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.136
that the alpha in a group
doesn't need to be a male,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.240
and that actually in one
of our close relatives, it is a female.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.616
So the message I want to leave you with

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.920
is that if you are looking
at men in our society

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.176
who are the boss of, let's say,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.896
a family or a business
or Washington or whatever,
