00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.416
and hold babies up like this.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.016
This is not particularly
something that babies like --

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.056
(Laughter)

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.656
but since it is a signal
to the rest of the world,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.696
they need to hold them in the air.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.096
And I was really intrigued by,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.936
when we had a female candidate
in the last election,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.296
the way she held babies
was more like this,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.416
which is what babies really like.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.776
But she of course
didn't need to send the message

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.016
that she could hold a baby
without dropping it,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.016
which was what the man was doing.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.896
So this is a very common tactic,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.896
and male chimpanzees,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.616
they spend a lot of time
currying favor with all sorts of parties
