Now, I do an enormous amount
of research on empathy,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.896
and I don't have time to go into it,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.976
but empathy is nowadays a topic
that we study in rodents and dogs

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.096
and elephants and primates,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.360
all sorts of animals.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.816
And what you see here is two bonobos.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.016
The one in front

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.496
has been beaten up in a fight.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.816
The one in the back puts
her arms around her and consoles her.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.496
This is also actually how we measure
empathy in young children,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.016
by looking at how they respond
to distressed individuals.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.336
And high-ranking males,
they do a lot of this.
