00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.800
because they have not demonstrated unity.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.376
So that's a very important part
of the coalition system,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.760
and that's something that we share
between humans and chimpanzees.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.136
Now, how do you become an alpha male?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.856
First of all, you need to be
impressive and intimidating

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.816
and demonstrate your vigor on occasion

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.460
and show that you are very strong,

00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:52.976
and there's all sorts
of ways of doing that.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.056
But other things that you need to do
is you need to be generous.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.656
So, for example,
males who go on a campaign

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.936
to dethrone the leader,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.456
which may take two or three months
