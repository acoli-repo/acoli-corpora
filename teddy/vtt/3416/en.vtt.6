is being submissive to him
and bowing for him,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.536
and that is the sort of ritual they need
to go through many times a day

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.440

I'll show you a video from the field.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.816

He has all his hair up

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.616
I'm actually standing far too close.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.656
A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am,
