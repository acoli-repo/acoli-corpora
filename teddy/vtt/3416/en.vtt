Well, I have known
many alpha males in my life,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.080
chimpanzee alpha males,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.416
and I'm going to talk
about what an alpha male is,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.456
because I think we can all learn
a lot from our close relatives

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.576
where we have alpha males.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.056
And as an example, I want to give you
Amos, a male that I knew

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.296
who was a young male
and he was alpha male,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.736
he was very popular,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.856
but he got sick

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.056
and he lost his position because,
you know, chimpanzee males
