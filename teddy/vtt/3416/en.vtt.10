He has only trouble
with the combination of the two.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.256
And so the coalition formation
that goes on in chimpanzee society

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.336
makes it much more complex than you think.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.176
It means, for example,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.176
that the smallest male in a group
can be the alpha male.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.656
You don't need to be
the biggest and strongest male.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.376
The smallest male, if he has
the right friends and keeps them happy,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.896
or he has female support,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.256
he can be the alpha male.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.736
So the coalition system
makes everything complex,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.136
and I'm always waiting here in the US

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.256
for the primaries,
the end of the primaries,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.056
because that's a moment
where you need to demonstrate unity.
