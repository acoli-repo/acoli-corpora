00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.856
you need to let that old male
mate with females.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.920
If you don't do that,
that old male is going to get mad at you,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.976
and you're going to lose him as a partner.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.096
So there's a transaction going on.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.056
If you become alpha male this way,
you need to keep your partners happy.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.576
And so that's one of the costs.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.016
The second cost is that
everyone wants your position.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.896
Alpha male position
is a very important position,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.096
and everyone wants to take it from you,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.296
and so you constantly
have to watch your back.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.976
You have to be extremely vigilant.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.696
For example, you have to
disrupt the coalitions of others

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.976
and that's what male
chimpanzees do quite a bit.
