00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.616
they spend a lot of time
currying favor with all sorts of parties

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.040
when they are campaigning.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.256
Now, what are the privileges and the costs

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.960
of being an alpha male?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.336
The biggest privilege is females.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.896
Food is really irrelevant.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.696
Male chimpanzees
can go a week without food

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.976
if there's a female in estrus
and they're sexually interested in her.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.256
Food is secondary to sex.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.056
And so the male chimpanzees --

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.096
and we evolutionary biologists, of course,
we have an explanation for this,
