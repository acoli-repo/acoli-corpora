00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.656
and as I said, in the primaries
always I'm waiting for that moment

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.656
because then you have
two members of the same party

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.576
who have been fighting with each other,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.016
and they need to come
together at some moment.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.976
And it leads to very awkward situations.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.816
People who don't like each other
need to embrace each other

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.096
and stand together,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.616
and that's absolutely essential
for the unity of the party,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.176
and if you don't do that,
the party may fall apart.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.096
And so if it doesn't go well,
like in this particular case --

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.416
(Laughter)

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.216
then the party is in deep doo-doo

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.800
because they have not demonstrated unity.
