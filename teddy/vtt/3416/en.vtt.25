00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.496
and there's actually
some self-interest involved in it.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.336
They don't do it just for the group,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.560
because it also stabilizes their position.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.216
The more popular
a male becomes as alpha male

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.936
and the more the rest of them
respects them and looks up to them,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.776
the better their position is defended

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.296
in case it's going to be
challenged by somebody else,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.616
because then, of course, the whole group
is going to support that male

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.296
because they want to keep
a leader who is good for them.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.686
So the group is usually very supportive
of males who are good leaders,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.976
and it's not supportive at all of bullies.
