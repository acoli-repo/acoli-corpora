00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.760
is the two old guys to the side.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.216
This is very chimpanzee.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.616
In chimpanzees,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.816
we have usually old males
who are over the hill,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.856
who cannot be alpha male
themselves anymore,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.696
but they start playing games
and forming coalitions,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.616
and behind the backs of others.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.495
And they become extremely influential,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.616
and you may actually have old males

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.976
who are more influential
than the alpha male himself.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.616
Just as an example,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.056
the three males
that I used to work with most

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.536
at the Dutch zoo long ago, where I worked,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.896
and the middle male here
is a 17-year-old alpha male.
