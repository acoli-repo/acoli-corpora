00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.496
which was recommended by Newt Gingrich
to freshmen congressmen.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.256
I don't know what good it did,
but he recommended that book to them,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.160
and after that the term
"alpha male" became very popular.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.736
But I think it is used
in a mischaracterization.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.096
It's used in a very superficial way

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.696
that doesn't relate
to what a real alpha male is.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.176
And so I'm here to explain what that is.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.856
The term itself goes back
actually much further.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.576
It goes back to the '40s and '50s,
research on wolves,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.696
and basically the definition
is very simple.
