00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.696
and basically the definition
is very simple.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.736
The highest ranking male
is the alpha male.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.016
The highest ranking female
is the alpha female.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.896
Every primate group
has one alpha male, one alpha female,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.976
not more than that, there's only one.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.200
And I will explain how that goes.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.456
So first, the body language.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.536
What you see here is two male chimpanzees
who are the same size,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.976
but one is walking upright,
has his hair up,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.576
has a big rock in his hand,
and he's the alpha male.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.056
The other male is pant-grunting to him,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.136
is being submissive to him
and bowing for him,
