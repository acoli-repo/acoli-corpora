A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.496
and I just was not very prudent,
this particular video.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.656
So what you saw him do

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.656
is he was lifting himself up
and standing on two legs,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.936
and putting his arms out.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.616
That's called the bipedal swagger.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.376
It's a very common posture
in high-ranking males,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.456
and it's very recognizable
because humans do this kind of stuff.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.696
(Laughter)

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.080
Humans do this all the time.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.616
And what I really like
about this particular picture

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.760
is the two old guys to the side.
