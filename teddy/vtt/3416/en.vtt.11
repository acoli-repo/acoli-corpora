00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.056
because that's a moment
where you need to demonstrate unity.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.656
Now let me first show you
how the unity is shown in chimpanzees.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.936
What you see here is two males on the left

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.216
who are standing together.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.616
You also see the big
canine teeth that they have.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.216
And they're standing together and they
demonstrate to the rest of the group,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.816
"We are together. We are a unit."

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.776
The males on the right
are walking together in synchrony.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.616
That's another way of demonstrating
that you are together.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.856
And so demonstrating unity
is extremely important

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.496
in a coalition system,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.656
and as I said, in the primaries
always I'm waiting for that moment
