They don't support their mom
or their best buddy.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.696
No, no, they stop fights,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.856
and they come up
for the underdog in general.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.056
And this makes them
extremely popular in the group,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.056
because they provide security

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.576
for the lowest-ranking
members of the group.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.416
And so they become impartial,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.096
which is an unusual condition
for a chimpanzee to be in,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.096
because they're usually
very fond of their friends and so on,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.176
and these alpha males
who are good at this,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.096
they can be very effective
at keeping the peace in the group.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.376
And the second thing they do
is they show empathy for others.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.136
Now, I do an enormous amount
of research on empathy,
