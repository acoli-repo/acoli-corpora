00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.016
She ranked below the males,
but she was the center of the community,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.216
and if there was big trouble
in the community,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.536
everyone would end up in the arms of Mama.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.776
And so she was a very important figure.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.976
And so I don't want to minimize
the position of alpha females

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.376
in the chimpanzee group.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.776
And then we have a species
that is equally close to us

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.256
as the chimpanzee, the bonobo.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.976
We often forget about the bonobo,
but the bonobos have a matriarchal society

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.536
and the alpha individual
is a female, generally.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.416
Generally, it's a female
who is at the top of the community,
