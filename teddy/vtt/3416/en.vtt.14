00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.456
which may take two or three months

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.136
where they're testing
all the coalitions in the group,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.096
they also become extremely generous.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.200
They share food very easily with everyone.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.816
Or they start to tickle
the babies of the females.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.376
They're normally, male chimpanzees,
not particularly interested in infants,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.576
but when they are campaigning like that,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.296
they get very interested in infants
and they tickle them,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.616
and they try to curry favor
with the females.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.656
(Laughter)

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.936
So in humans, of course,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.976
I am always intrigued
by these men who are candidates

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.416
and hold babies up like this.
