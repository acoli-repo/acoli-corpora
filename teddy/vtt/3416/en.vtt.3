00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.656
So Amos was an example
of a male who was liked as a leader,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.096
and I think the term alpha male,
if you look it up on the internet,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.776
you will find all these business books
that tell you how to be an alpha male,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.176
and what they mean
is how to beat up others

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.176
and beat them over the head
and let them know that you are boss

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.936
and don't mess with me and so on.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.760
And basically an alpha male
for them is a bully.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.496
And I really don't like
that kind of description,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.736
because I am actually partly responsible
for the term "alpha male"

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.016
because I wrote this book
"Chimpanzee Politics,"

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.496
which was recommended by Newt Gingrich
to freshmen congressmen.
