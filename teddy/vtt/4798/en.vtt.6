00:02:55.929 --> 00:03:01.086
In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum,

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:04.942
so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use.

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:08.709
The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.548
hits us in a short time period,

00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:14.440
also known as an acute exposure.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.233
Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.610
This can trigger cancers,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.126
cellular dysfunction,

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.638
and potentially even death.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.154
Fortunately, acute exposures are rare,

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:31.562
but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation
