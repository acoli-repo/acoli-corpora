00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:33.460
because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.012
All nuclear radiation is ionizing,

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:40.640
while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.987
That includes gamma rays,

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.073
X-rays,

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.078
and the high-energy end of ultraviolet.

00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:48.850
That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.059
doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine,

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.929
and why beach-goers use sunscreen.

00:02:55.929 --> 00:03:01.086
In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum,
