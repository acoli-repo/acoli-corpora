00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.402
struggles to overcome this repulsion

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.917
and keep the nucleus intact.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:37.454
However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons,

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:38.964
known as isotopes,

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.990
remain unstable,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.276
or radioactive.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:46.110
They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.083
known as nuclear radiation,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.399
to achieve greater stability.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.170
Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.509
a gas which seeps up from the ground.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.146
We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores
