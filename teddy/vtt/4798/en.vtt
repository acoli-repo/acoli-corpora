When we hear the word radiation,

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:13.120
it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.637
but that's not the full story.

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:16.889
Radiation also applies to rainbows

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:19.846
and a doctor examining an x-ray.

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.846
So what is radiation really,

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:25.092
and how much should we worry
about its effects?

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:28.026
The answer begins with understanding

describes two very different 
scientific phenomena:
