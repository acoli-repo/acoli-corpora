00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:31.562
but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation

00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:35.324
from both natural and man-made sources.

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:38.842
Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks.

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:42.663
Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.856
and if it can't,

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:48.781
the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.873
One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure

00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:53.967
is a unit called the sievert.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:59.376
An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours,

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:02.175
and four sieverts could be fatal.
