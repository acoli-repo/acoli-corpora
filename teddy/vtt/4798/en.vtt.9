00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:32.455
you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.580
We live in a world of radiation.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.318
However, much of that radiation
is non-ionizing.

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:40.316
For the remainder that is ionizing,

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:42.540
our exposures are usually low,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.269
and choices like getting your home
tested for radon

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:47.007
and wearing sunscreen

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.106
can help reduce 
the associated health risks.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:53.222
Marie Curie, 
one of the early radiation pioneers,

00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:55.541
summed up the challenge as follows:

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.976
"Nothing in life is to be feared,
it is only to be understood.

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:04.672
Now is the time to understand more,
so that we may fear less."
