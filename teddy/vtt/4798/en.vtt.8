00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:02.175
and four sieverts could be fatal.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:06.042
However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower.

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:10.160
The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.726
from all sources annually,

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:15.107
around a third due to radon.

00:04:15.107 --> 00:04:17.518
At only five microsieverts each,

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:20.583
you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.862
to rack up your annual dosage.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.475
And remember that banana?

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.084
If you could absorb 
all the banana's radiation,

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:32.455
you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage.
