00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:31.627
describes two very different 
scientific phenomena:

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:33.626
electromagnetic radiation

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.202
and nuclear radiation.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.642
Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.638
consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves

00:00:43.638 --> 00:00:46.146
oscillating through space.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.847
As these waves oscillate faster,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.488
they scale up in energy.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:53.069
At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio,

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.879
infrared,

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.376
and visible light.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.279
At the higher end are ultraviolet,

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:59.213
X-ray,

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:00.962
and gamma rays.
