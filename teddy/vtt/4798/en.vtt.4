00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.146
We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.789
to fuel nuclear power plants.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.159
Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.576
So if we live in a world of radiation,

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:13.603
how can we escape its dangerous effects?

00:02:13.603 --> 00:02:17.332
To start, not all radiation is hazardous.

00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:23.361
Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact,

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.000
a process that can damage DNA.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.636
This is known as ionizing radiation

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:33.460
because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion.
