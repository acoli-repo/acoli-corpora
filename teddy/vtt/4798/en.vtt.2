00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:00.962
and gamma rays.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:06.109
Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.089
We might download an email to our phone
via radio waves

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:12.449
to open an image of an X-ray print,

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:16.720
which we can see because our screen
emits visible light.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.941
Nuclear radiation, on the other hand,

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.230
originates in the atomic nucleus,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.710
where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.402
struggles to overcome this repulsion
