00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:03.152
we have to rely on sophisticated
computer simulations

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:06.969
in order to understand
these complex phenomena.

00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:12.154
These simulations can be used
to really understand how gas behaves

00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:14.125
under such extreme conditions.

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.421
And can be used to answer
fundamental questions

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:20.620
like, "What ultimately disrupted
the massive star?"

00:06:20.644 --> 00:06:24.715
"How is it that this implosion
can be reversed into an explosion?"

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.048
There's a huge amount
of debate in the field,
