00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:31.962
came from one of these
supernova explosions.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:36.863
So now you may be wondering,

00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.887
how is it that these atoms

00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:43.664
that were generated in such
extreme conditions

00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:46.222
ultimately took residence in our body?

00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:51.081
So I want you to follow
the thought experiment.

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:54.600
Imagine that we're in the Milky Way,
and a supernova happens.

00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:58.895
It blasted tons and tons of oxygen atoms

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:01.228
almost into empty space.
