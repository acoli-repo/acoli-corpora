00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:03.187
An oxygen atom
has just gone into your body.

00:12:03.211 --> 00:12:05.538
It is certain that that oxygen [atom]

00:12:05.562 --> 00:12:07.799
remembers that it was
in the interior of a star

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:11.196
and it was probably manufactured
by a supernova explosion.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.220
This atom may have traveled
the entire solar system

00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:18.498
until it splashed on earth,

00:12:18.522 --> 00:12:20.505
long before reaching you.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:23.703
When we breathe,

00:12:24.982 --> 00:12:29.777
we use hundreds of liters
of oxygen every day.
