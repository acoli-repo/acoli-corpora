00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:04.190
So studying supernova remnants,
like the Crab Nebula,

00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:06.508
allowed astronomers to firmly conclude

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:11.975
that the vast majority of oxygen on earth
was produced by supernova explosions

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:14.199
over the history of the universe.

00:10:15.117 --> 00:10:16.633
And we can estimate

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:21.100
that in order to assemble
all the atoms of oxygen in our body,

00:10:21.124 --> 00:10:24.392
it took on the order
of a 100 million supernova.

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:29.143
So every bit of you,
or at least the majority of it,

00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:31.962
came from one of these
supernova explosions.
