A few of them were able
to be assembled in a cloud.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.577
Now, 4.5 billion years ago,

00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:14.069
something unsettled that cloud
and caused it to collapse,

00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:18.394
forming the sun in its center
and the solar system.

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:23.819
So the sun, the planets and life on earth

00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:26.407
depend on this beautiful cycle

00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:31.280
of stellar birth, stellar death
and stellar rebirth.
