And this continues the recycling

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:40.615
And as a result, astronomy
and chemistry are intimately connected.

We are life forms that have evolved
to inhale the waste products of plants.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.522
But now you know

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:53.720

of supernova explosions.
