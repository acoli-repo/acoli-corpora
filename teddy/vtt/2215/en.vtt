00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:04.531
We are all atomically connected.

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.864
Fundamentally, universally.

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:09.489
But what does that mean?

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.625
I'm an astrophysicist, and as such,

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.684
it is my responsibility to trace
the cosmic history

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:20.513
of every single one of your atoms.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:23.613
In fact, I would say

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:27.196
that one of the greatest achievements
of modern astronomy

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.386
is the understanding of how our atoms
were actually put together.
