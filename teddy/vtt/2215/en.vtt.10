00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:02.799
reaching incredibly high densities.

00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:06.656
Think of 300 million tons

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.680
reduced to a space
the size of a sugar cube.

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:15.067
At these extreme high densities,
the core actually resists collapse,

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:16.686
and as a result,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.598
all of this infalling material
bounces off the core.

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:22.816
And this dramatic bounce,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.807
which happens in a fraction
of a second or so,

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:32.664
is responsible for ejecting
the rest of the star in all directions,
