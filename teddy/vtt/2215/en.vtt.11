WEBVTT

00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:32.664
is responsible for ejecting
the rest of the star in all directions,

00:05:32.688 --> 00:05:35.422
ultimately forming a supernova explosion.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.680
So, sadly, from the perspective
of an astrophysicist,

00:05:43.704 --> 00:05:47.103
the conditions in the centers
of these exploding stars

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:49.410
cannot be recreated in a laboratory.

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:50.442
(Laughter)

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:54.085
Now, thankfully for humanity,
we're not able to do that.

00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:55.815
(Laughter)

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.062
But what does that mean?

00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:58.768
That means that as astrophysicists,

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:03.152
we have to rely on sophisticated
computer simulations
