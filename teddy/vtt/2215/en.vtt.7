00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:30.037
You can think of stars
as these fusion factories

00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:33.006
which are powered
by smashing atoms together

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.339
in their hot and dense interiors.

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.196
Now, stars like our sun,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.704
which are relatively small,

00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.942
burn hydrogen into helium,

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:45.751
but heavier stars of about
eight times the mass of the sun

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.251
continue this burning cycle

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:51.924
even after they exhausted
their helium in their cores.

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:55.268
So at this point,

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:58.458
the massive star
is left with a carbon core,

00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:01.668
which, as you know,
is the building block of life.
