00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:30.022
Various civilizations
recorded these supernova explosions

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:33.009
long before the telescope was invented.

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:36.896
The most famous of all of them

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.608
is probably the supernova explosion
that gave rise to the Crab Nebula.

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:43.014
Yeah?

00:08:43.038 --> 00:08:49.093
Korean and Chinese astronomers
recorded this supernova in 1054,

00:08:49.117 --> 00:08:51.800
as did, almost certainly,
Native Americans.

00:08:53.372 --> 00:08:58.632
This supernova happened
about 5,600 light-years away from earth.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.403
And it was so incredibly bright
