There's a huge amount
of debate in the field,

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:34.506
but we all agree that neutrinos,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.338
which are these elusive
elementary particles,

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:38.878
play a crucial role.

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:41.038
Yeah?

00:06:41.062 --> 00:06:44.015
I'm about to show you
one of those simulations.

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:52.159
So neutrinos are produced in huge numbers
once the core collapses.

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:53.354
And in fact,

00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:57.061
they are responsible for transferring
the energy in this core.

00:06:57.696 --> 00:07:00.307
Like thermal radiation in a heater,
