So breathing is not only filling our lungs
with cosmic history,

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.938
but with human history.

00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:40.675
I would like to end my talk
by sharing a myth

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:42.500
that is very close to my heart.

00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:44.889
A myth from the Chichimeca culture,

00:13:44.913 --> 00:13:47.921
which is a very powerful
Mesoamerican culture.

00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:51.201
And the Chichimecas believe

00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:54.625
that our essence
was assembled in the heavens.

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:56.815
And on its journey towards us,

00:13:56.839 --> 00:14:00.437
it actually fragmented
into tons of different pieces.
