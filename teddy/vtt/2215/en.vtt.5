00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.792
Not only is the vast majority
of our bodies made of oxygen,

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:36.522
but oxygen is the one element
fighting to protect life on earth.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.855
The vast majority of oxygen
in the universe

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.926
was indeed produced
over the entire history of the universe

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.950
in these supernova explosions.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.450
These supernova explosions
signal the demise of very massive stars.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:54.807
And for a brilliant month,

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:59.006
one supernova explosion
can be brighter than an entire galaxy

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.442
containing billions of stars.
