00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.403
And it was so incredibly bright

00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:03.936
that astronomers could see it
during the day.

00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:09.499
And it was visible to the naked eye
for about two years in the night sky.

00:09:13.278 --> 00:09:17.641
Fast forward 1,000 years or so later,
and what do we see?

00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:22.173
We see these filaments
that were blasted by the explosion,

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:24.713
moving at 300 miles per second.

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:29.307
These filaments are essential
for us to understand

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.264
how massive stars die.
