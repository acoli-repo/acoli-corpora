00:12:31.566 --> 00:12:36.590
So I'm incredibly lucky to be standing
in front of this beautiful audience,

00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:39.852
but I'm actually stealing
your oxygen atoms.

00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:42.405
(Laughter)

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:43.961
And because I'm speaking to you,

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:47.548
I'm giving you some of them back,
that once resided in me.

00:12:51.276 --> 00:12:56.012
So breathing, yeah,

00:12:56.036 --> 00:13:00.125
participates in this
beautiful exchange of atoms.
