00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:32.703
which means that we cannot
extract energy by burning iron.

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:38.926
So when the entire core
of the massive star is made of iron,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.350
it's run out of fuel.

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:44.006
And that's an incredibly
bad day for a star.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.656
(Laughter)

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.182
Without fuel, it cannot generate heat,

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:55.234
and therefore gravity has won the battle.

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:59.950
The iron core has no other choice
but to collapse,

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:02.799
reaching incredibly high densities.
