00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.264
how massive stars die.

00:09:31.752 --> 00:09:33.117
The image that you see there

00:09:33.141 --> 00:09:35.585
was assembled
by the Hubble Space Telescope

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.476
over a span of three months.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.262
And it is incredibly important
to astronomers

00:09:40.286 --> 00:09:43.474
because it ultimately carries
the chemical legacy

00:09:43.498 --> 00:09:45.231
of the star that exploded.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.833
The orange filaments that you see there
are the tattered remains of the star,

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:53.190
and are made primarily of hydrogen,

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.817
while the blue and red
filaments that you see

00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:59.330
are the freshly synthesized oxygen.

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:04.190
So studying supernova remnants,
like the Crab Nebula,
