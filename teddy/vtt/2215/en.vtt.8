00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:01.668
which, as you know,
is the building block of life.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.514
This carbon core continues to collapse

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.045
and as a result,
the temperature increases,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.023
which allows further
nuclear reactions to take place,

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:15.675
and carbon then burns into oxygen,

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.365
into neon, silicon, sulphur

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.008
and ultimately iron.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.531
And iron is the end.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.719
Why?

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:28.278
Because iron is the most
bound nuclei in the universe,

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:32.703
which means that we cannot
extract energy by burning iron.
