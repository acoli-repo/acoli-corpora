00:06:57.696 --> 00:07:00.307
Like thermal radiation in a heater,

00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:03.879
neutrinos pump energy into the core,

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:08.315
increasing the possibility
of disrupting the star.

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:11.545
In fact, for about a fraction of a second,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.196
neutrinos pump so much energy

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.900
that the pressure increases high enough
that a shock wave is produced

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:21.636
and the shock wave
goes and disrupts the entire star.

00:07:22.006 --> 00:07:26.284
And it is in that shock wave
where elements are produced.

00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:29.958
So thank you, neutrinos.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.577
