00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:01.943
and that causes stars to shine

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:04.060
and ultimately explode,

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:09.497
therefore enriching the universe
with these heavy elements.

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:14.224
So without stellar death

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:17.291
there would be no oxygen

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:20.886
or other elements
heavier than hydrogen and helium,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.436
and therefore, there would be no life.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.705
There are more atoms in our bodies

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.673
than stars in the universe.
