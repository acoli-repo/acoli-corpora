00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.386
is the understanding of how our atoms
were actually put together.

00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:36.664
While hydrogen and helium were made

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.760
during the first two minutes
of the big bang,

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:42.180
the origin of heavy elements,

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:46.514
such as the iron in your blood,
the oxygen we're breathing,

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:48.823
the silicone in your computers,

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:51.982
lies in the life cycle of stars.

00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:59.411
Nuclear reactions take lighter elements
and transform them into heavier ones,

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:01.943
and that causes stars to shine
