00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And you should be really afraid,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but not for the reasons why you think you should be.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You should be really afraid that --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this is what this adventure's really about.
