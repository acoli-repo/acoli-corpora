00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:02.923
But I started to hear stories

00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:05.828
from people who lived
in these mining communities.

00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:09.149
They said that the water
they drank was not clean,

00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:11.529
that the air they breathed was polluted.

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.299
They would tell me
about their own illnesses

00:04:14.323 --> 00:04:16.298
or illnesses in their family.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:20.070
They were worried about how common
cancer was in their neighborhoods.

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:22.649
I met with many people
in southern West Virginia

00:04:22.673 --> 00:04:24.006
and eastern Kentucky

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.701
to listen to those stories
and hear their concerns.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.923
I searched the scientific literature

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:31.859
and was surprised to learn
that nothing had been published
