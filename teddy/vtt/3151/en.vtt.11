00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:33.260
We found evidence that confirmed
the concerns of the residents,

00:05:33.284 --> 00:05:35.450
and we started to publish our findings.

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:38.014
As a very brief summary,

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:41.927
we found that people who live
where mountaintop removal takes place

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:46.086
have significantly higher levels
of cardiovascular disease,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.575
kidney disease and chronic
lung disease like COPD.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:53.260
Death rates from cancer
are significantly elevated,

00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:55.084
especially for lung cancer.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.244
We've seen evidence
for higher rates of birth defects

00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:00.458
and for babies born at low birth weight.
