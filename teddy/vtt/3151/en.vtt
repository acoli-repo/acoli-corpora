00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:04.324
Let's say that you wanted
to conduct an experiment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.151
In this experiment,

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:09.571
you randomly assign people
to live in blasting zones

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.276
or in control locations without explosives
going off over their heads.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.072
They live in the community for years,

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.026
just downwind and downstream

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.521
from sites where tons of explosives
are used almost daily.

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:26.728
And millions of gallons
of water contaminated.

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.823
With random assignment,
you could carefully study
