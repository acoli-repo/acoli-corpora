I worked with scientists
at the US Geological Survey

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.260
on environmental sampling
for more than two years.

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:38.966
And just as they were starting
to publish their findings,

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.244
they were suddenly instructed
by their superiors

00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:43.201
to stop work on this project.

00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:47.840
In August of this year,
the National Academy of Sciences

00:08:47.864 --> 00:08:50.236
was suddenly instructed
by the federal government

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.522
to stop their independent review

00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:55.274
of the public health consequences
of surface mining.

00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.907
These actions are politically
motivated, in my view.
