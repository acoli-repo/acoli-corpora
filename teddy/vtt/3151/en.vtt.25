Because integrity is the coin of the realm

00:12:31.387 --> 00:12:33.879
in scientific and public policy debate.

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:35.118

00:12:38.895 --> 00:12:41.838

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.488

our reputation for integrity,

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.260
when we patiently stand up for the data
and keep doing the studies

00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:02.006
and keep calmly bringing
the results to the public,
