00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.823
With random assignment,
you could carefully study

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:34.890
the long-term health effects
of living in these blasting communities

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:38.300
without a bunch of annoying
confounders and covariates.

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.323
Random assignment does wonders.

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:46.561
That would be a rigorous,
powerful scientific inquiry

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:49.354
into the effects of these
environmental exposures.

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.456
Of course, such a study
could never be done.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.537
Most scientists wouldn't have
the stomach for it.

00:00:55.942 --> 00:00:58.483
The institutional review board
would never approve it;

00:00:58.507 --> 00:01:00.581
it would never pass human subjects review,
