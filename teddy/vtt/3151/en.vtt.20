00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:03.577
There can always be doubt,
if doubt is what you seek.

00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.220
Because we can never do that
defining experiment.

00:10:06.244 --> 00:10:09.691
Any next study
must always be associational.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.506
So perhaps you can understand
why I've started to wonder,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.895
how much evidence is enough?

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:19.319
I've published over 30 papers
on this topic so far.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.061
Along with my coauthors, other researchers
have added to the evidence,

00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:25.347
yet government doesn't want to listen,

00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:28.283
and the industry says
it's only correlational.

00:10:28.307 --> 00:10:30.973
They say Appalachians
have lifestyle issues.
