00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:32.607
Rock and soil debris
is dumped over the valley sides

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.315
where it permanently buries
headwater streams.

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:39.978
So far, over 500 mountains
have been destroyed.

00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.646
About 2,000 miles of streams
have been permanently buried.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.376
Water emerging from the base
of the valley fills is highly contaminated

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.867
and remains contaminated for decades.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.498
The coal then has to be
chemically treated,

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:57.527
crushed and washed before it can be
transported to power plants and burned.

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:00.409
This cleaning takes place on-site.
