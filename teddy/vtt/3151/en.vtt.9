00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:31.859
and was surprised to learn
that nothing had been published

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:35.696
on the public health effects
of coal mining in the United States.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.879
Let me say that again --

00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:39.569
nothing had been published
on the public health effects

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.260
of coal mining in the US.

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:45.268
So I thought, "I can make
a new contribution,

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:46.758
no matter what I find,

00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:51.196
to either confirm these concerns
or to alleviate them."

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:54.456
I had no personal
or organizational agenda.

00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:58.062
Many of my colleagues
initially were skeptical

00:04:58.086 --> 00:05:01.220
that there would be any link
between public health and mining.
