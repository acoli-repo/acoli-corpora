At conferences or meetings,
they express skepticism.

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:11.499
OK, we are all taught,
as scientists, to be skeptical.

00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:15.355
They ask, "What about
this possible explanation?"

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:18.402
"Have you considered
that alternative interpretation?"

00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:22.196
They wonder, "There must be
some confounder that we missed.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.389
Some other variable
we haven't accounted for."

00:09:25.863 --> 00:09:28.403
"An in vitro study, what does that prove?"

00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:33.173
"A rat study -- how do we know the same
effects would be found in people?"
