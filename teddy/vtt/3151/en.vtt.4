The process involves clear-cutting
ancient Appalachian forest,

00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:06.285
home to some of the richest
biodiversity on the planet.

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:10.615
The trees are typically burned
or dumped into adjacent valleys.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.530
Then, to reach the buried coal seams,

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:20.309
explosives are used to remove
up to 800 feet of mountain elevation.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.895
Over 1,500 tons of explosives

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.656
are used for coal mining
in West Virginia alone.

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.037
Every day.
