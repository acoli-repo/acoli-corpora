00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.681
alongside the debate over climate change

00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:32.120
or the argument years ago

00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:34.739
about whether or not
smoking caused cancer.

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:39.468
In this twilight zone, much of the data
seems to point to one conclusion.

00:11:39.492 --> 00:11:42.778
But the economics or the politics
or the prevailing public view

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:45.068
insist on the opposite conclusion.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.101
When you're a scientist
and you think you have a valid insight

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.476
where the health
of entire populations is at stake

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.823
but you find yourself trapped

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:57.355
in this twilight zone
of denial and disbelief,

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:00.179
what is your moral and ethical obligation?
