00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:00.458
and for babies born at low birth weight.

00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:05.664
The difference in total mortality
equates to about 1,200 excess deaths

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:09.910
every year in MTR areas,
controlling for other risks.

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:12.817
Twelve hundred excess deaths every year.

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:15.395
Not only are death rates higher,

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.664
but they increase
as the levels of mining go up

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.422
in a dose-response manner.

00:06:19.863 --> 00:06:23.458
Next, we started to conduct
community door-to-door health surveys.

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:27.024
We surveyed people
living within a few miles of MTR

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.410
versus similar rural
communities without mining.
