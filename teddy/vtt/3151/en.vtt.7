There are over a million people
who live in counties where MTR takes place

00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:37.405
and millions more downstream and downwind.

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.778
What has been the response
of industry and government

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:43.275
when these issues are documented?

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.847
And again, what is the ethical
obligation of science

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.275
when faced with this disturbing situation?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.537
I began to research this issue in 2006.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.474
I had just taken a job
at West Virginia University.

00:03:56.498 --> 00:03:59.911
Before then, I hadn't done
any research related to coal.
