00:06:57.609 --> 00:07:00.379
We found that violations
of public drinking-water standards

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:04.745
are seven times more common
in MTR areas versus non-mining areas.

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.156
We collected air samples

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.386
and found that particulate matter
is elevated in mining communities,

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.278
especially in the ultra-fine range.

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.660
The dust in mining communities
contains a complex mixture,

00:07:16.684 --> 00:07:20.795
but includes high levels of silica,
a known lung carcinogen,

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.688
and potentially harmful organic compounds.

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:26.260
We used the dust in laboratory experiments

00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:29.958
and found that it induced
cardiovascular dysfunction in rats.
