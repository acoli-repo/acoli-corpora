it would never pass human subjects review,

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.205
because it would be unethical, immoral.

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:07.102
And yet in effect,
it is happening right now.

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.776
In my mind, this prompts some questions.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.298
What is the ethical obligation

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.522
of the scientists who believes
populations are in danger?

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:20.552
How much evidence is enough
to be confident of our conclusions?

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.083
Where is the line between
scientific certainty and the need to act?

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.566
The unplanned experiment
that is happening right now

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.585
is called mountaintop removal.
