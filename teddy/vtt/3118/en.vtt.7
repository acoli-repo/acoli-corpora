00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.561
to active-duty military personnel.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.246
But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.983
or the results of that study,

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.648
I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:44.220
So what we do in the laboratory

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:48.553
is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.196
In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.966
that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.601
These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity.
