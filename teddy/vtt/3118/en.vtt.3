00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:31.862
First, how does attention
control our perception?

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:34.633
Second, why does it fail us,

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.917
often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.752
And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess,

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:44.954
can we train our brain
to pay better attention?

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:50.546
To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives.

00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:55.268
So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.109
into how we're going to look at this.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.111
A very poignant example

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.093
of how our attention
ends up getting utilized.
