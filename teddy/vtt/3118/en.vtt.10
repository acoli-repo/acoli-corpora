00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:01.553
You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:04.116
And what we do is we ask our participants

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.863
as they're viewing a series
of these types of overlaid images,

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:09.726
to do something with their attention.

00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:13.127
On some trials, we'll ask them
to pay attention to the face.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.578
And to make sure they're doing that,

00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:18.180
we ask them to tell us,
by pressing a button,

00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:20.516
if the face appeared to be male or female.

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:22.268
On other trials,

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:26.090
we ask them to tell what the scene was --
was it indoor or outdoor?

00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:28.768
And in this way,
we can manipulate attention

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:31.974
and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said.
