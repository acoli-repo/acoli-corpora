00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:31.974
and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said.

00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.952
Our hypotheses about attention
were as follows:

00:05:37.014 --> 00:05:41.371
if attention is indeed doing its job
and affecting perception,

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:43.595
maybe it works like an amplifier.

00:05:44.252 --> 00:05:45.427
And what I mean by this

00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:47.650
is that when we direct
attention to the face,

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:50.302
it becomes clearer and more salient,

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:51.946
it's easier to see.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.923
But when we direct it to the scene,
the face becomes barely perceptible

00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:57.978
as we process the scene information.

00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:00.037
So what we wanted to do
