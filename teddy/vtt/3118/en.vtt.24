00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.252
to our present-moment experience
with awareness.

00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:15.119
And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.089
It's about keeping
that button right on play

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.144
to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives.

00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:24.632
And mindfulness is not just a concept.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.950
you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits.
