00:11:28.506 --> 00:11:31.227
Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind.

00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:33.497
Not just to productively plan.

00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:35.582
But we end up catastrophizing or worrying

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:37.601
about events that haven't happened yet

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:39.283
and frankly may never happen.

00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:42.918
So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK,

00:11:42.942 --> 00:11:45.196
mind-wandering's happening a lot.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.695
Often, it happens without our awareness.

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:49.940
And under stress, it's even worse --

00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:52.410
we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often.

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:54.720
Is there anything
we can possibly do about this?

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:57.712
And I'm happy to say the answer is yes.

00:11:58.292 --> 00:11:59.736
From our work, we're learning

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.666
that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one.
