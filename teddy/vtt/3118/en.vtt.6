He was gripped with suffering.

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:04.442
His mind was worried and preoccupied

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.925
and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future.

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:11.918
And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.030
Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:17.458
that was probably suffering;

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:19.656
many of his fellow marines
probably were, too.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.927
And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project

00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:29.545
that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.561
to active-duty military personnel.
