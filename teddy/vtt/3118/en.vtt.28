00:14:00.244 --> 00:14:01.768
So here's what we find.

00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:03.205
Over a high-stress interval,

00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:06.107
unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all,

00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:07.386
attention declines,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.958
people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before.

00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:15.037
But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this.

00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:18.102
They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups,

00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:19.802
they were experiencing high stress.

00:14:20.473 --> 00:14:22.290
And perhaps even more impressive

00:14:22.314 --> 00:14:24.401
is that if people
take our training programs

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:26.077
over, let's say, eight weeks,

00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:29.859
and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises

00:14:29.883 --> 00:14:34.258
that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment,
