00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:30.927
we had to basically come up
with an experiment

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.474
in which we could have people
generate their own mind-wandering.

00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:36.323
This is having off-task thoughts

00:07:36.347 --> 00:07:39.881
while we're engaged
in an ongoing task of some sort.

00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:44.571
And the trick to mind-wandering
is that essentially, you bore people.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:48.371
So hopefully there's not a lot
of mind-wandering happening right now.

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:49.712
When we bore people,

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:54.370
people happily generate all kinds
of internal content to occupy themselves.

00:07:54.394 --> 00:07:56.220
So we devised what might be considered

00:07:56.244 --> 00:07:58.244
one of the world's
most boring experiments.

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:01.315
All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen,
