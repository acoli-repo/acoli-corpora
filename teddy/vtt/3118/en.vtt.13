00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:31.948
since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases --

00:06:31.972 --> 00:06:33.759
attention changes perception.

00:06:33.783 --> 00:06:35.727
And it does so very fast.

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.894
Within 170 milliseconds
of actually seeing a face.

00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:42.800
In our follow-up studies,
we wanted to see what would happen,

00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:45.204
how could we perturb
or diminish this effect.

00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:50.323
And our hunch was that if you put people
in a very stressful environment,

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.236
if you distract them with disturbing,
negative images,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.855
images of suffering and violence --

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.801
sort of like what you might see
on the news, unfortunately --

00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:01.383
that doing this might
actually affect their attention.
