00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:30.648
above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.355
Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue,

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.338
as the brain's face detector,

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.943
that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.015
We call it the N170 component.

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.211
And we use this component
in many of our studies.

00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:50.279
It allows us to see the impact
that attention may have on our perception.

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:53.729
I'm going to give you a sense
of the kind of experiments

00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:55.252
that we actually do in the lab.

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:57.871
We would show participants
images like this one.

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:01.553
You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other.
