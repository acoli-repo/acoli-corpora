00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.396
is not about his time in the battlefield.

00:02:31.744 --> 00:02:34.228
He was actually on a bridge, in Florida.

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:37.259
But instead of looking
at the scenery around him,

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:38.879
seeing the beautiful vistas

00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:41.466
and noticing the cool ocean breezes,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.410
he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.217
And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so.

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:53.542
You see, he'd just returned from Iraq.

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:56.121
And while his body was on that bridge,

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:59.383
his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away.

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:01.050
He was gripped with suffering.
