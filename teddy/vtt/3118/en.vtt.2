We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain.

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:04.910
Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.468
In some sense, it's your brain's boss.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:09.479
And over the last 15 years,

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.042
I've been studying
the human brain's attention system.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.434
In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question.

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:20.093
If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss,

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:21.410
is it a good boss?

00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:23.501
Does it actually guide us well?

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:27.871
And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:31.862
First, how does attention
control our perception?
