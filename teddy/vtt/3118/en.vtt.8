00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:02.823
And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision.

00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:07.942
So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time.

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:14.325
And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.726
About 170 milliseconds

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.260
after we show our research participants
a face on the screen,

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:25.006
we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.418
It happens right at the back of the scalp,

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:30.648
above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing.
