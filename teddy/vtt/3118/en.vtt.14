00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:01.383
that doing this might
actually affect their attention.

00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:03.029
And that's indeed what we found.

00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:06.212
If we present stressful images
while they're doing this experiment,

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:09.887
this gap of attention shrinks,
its power diminishes.

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:12.840
So in some of our other studies,

00:07:12.864 --> 00:07:14.373
we wanted to see, OK, great --

00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:17.540
not great, actually, bad news
that stress does this to the brain --

00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:21.569
but if it is the case that stress
has this powerful influence on attention

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:23.466
through external distraction,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.498
what if we don't need
external distraction,

00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:27.411
what if we distract ourselves?

00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:28.744
And to do this,

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:30.927
we had to basically come up
with an experiment
