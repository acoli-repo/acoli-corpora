00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:00.037
So what we wanted to do

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:04.155
is look at this brain-wave component
of face detection, the N170,

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.205
and see if it changed at all

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.237
as a function of where our participants
were paying attention --

00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.700
to the scene or the face.

00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:12.569
And here's what we found.

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:15.411
We found that when they paid
attention to the face,

00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:16.954
the N170 was larger.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:21.117
And when they paid attention to the scene,
as you can see in red, it was smaller.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.772
And that gap you see
between the blue and red lines

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.036
is pretty powerful.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.006
What it tells us is that attention,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.114
which is really the only
thing that changed,

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:31.948
since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases --
