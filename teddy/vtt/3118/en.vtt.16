00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:01.315
All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen,

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:02.537
one after another.

00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:05.054
They pressed the button
every time they saw the face.

00:08:05.078 --> 00:08:06.229
That was pretty much it.

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.603
Well, one trick was that sometimes,
the face would be upside down,

00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:11.469
and it would happen very infrequently.

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:14.389
On those trials they were told
just to withhold the response.

00:08:14.752 --> 00:08:18.038
Pretty soon, we could tell that
they were successfully mind-wandering,

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:21.031
because they pressed the button
when that face was upside down.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.913
Even though it's quite plain to see
that it was upside down.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:27.106
So we wanted to know what happens
when people have mind-wandering.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.184
And what we found was that,

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.050
very similar to external stress
