00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:31.149
that gets fully utilized

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:35.664
and even though it is
at full capacity being used,

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:38.172
it suffers from a problem
of information overload.

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:41.761
There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process.

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:44.873
So to solve this problem of overload,

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:46.857
evolution devised a solution,

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.864
which is the brain's attention system.

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:51.418
Attention allows us

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:55.958
to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources

00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:58.382
to a subset of all that's available.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.402
We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain.
