00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.093
of how our attention
ends up getting utilized.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.951
And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.483
He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.045
for whom attention
is a matter of life and death.

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.872
Think of medical professionals

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:19.392
or firefighters

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.837
or soldiers or marines.

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:25.622
This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis.

00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:29.315
And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see,

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.396
is not about his time in the battlefield.
