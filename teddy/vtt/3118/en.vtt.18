00:08:58.243 --> 00:09:01.788
But that's all in the context of these
very controlled laboratory settings.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:03.233
What about in the real world?

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:05.306
What about in our actual day-to-day life?

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.480
What about now?

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:08.799
Where is your attention right now?

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:10.403
To kind of bring it back,

00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:12.783
I'd like to make a prediction
about your attention

00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:14.252
for the remainder of my talk.

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:15.744
Are you up for it?

00:09:15.768 --> 00:09:17.450
Here's the prediction.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:21.703
You will be unaware of what I'm saying
for four out of the next eight minutes.

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:22.728
(Laughter)

00:09:22.752 --> 00:09:25.450
It's a challenge,
so pay attention, please.

00:09:25.474 --> 00:09:27.759
Now, why am I saying this?

00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:32.275
I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated
