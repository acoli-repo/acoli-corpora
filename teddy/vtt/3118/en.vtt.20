00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.140
but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing,

00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:06.470
or a judge missing
four minutes of testimony.

00:10:06.494 --> 00:10:08.654
Or a surgeon or firefighter
missing any time.

00:10:08.678 --> 00:10:11.217
The consequences
in those cases could be dire.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.934
So we might ask why do we do this?

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.667
Why do we mind-wander so much?

00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:21.518
Well, part of the answer is that our mind
is an exquisite time-traveling master.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.045
It can actually time travel very easily.

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:27.553
If we think of the mind as the metaphor
of the music player, we see this.

00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:29.332
We can rewind the mind to the past

00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:32.048
to reflect on events
that have already happened, right?
