00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:32.275
I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:35.173
and, you know, graciously keep
your eyes on me as I speak.

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:40.180
But a growing body of literature suggests
that we mind-wander,

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:42.506
we take our mind away
from the task at hand,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.130
about 50 percent of our waking moments.

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:48.387
These might be small,
little trips that we take away,

00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:49.934

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:53.268
And when this mind-wandering happens,

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.466
it can be problematic.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.987
Now I don't think there will be
any dire consequences

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.576
with you all sitting here today,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.140
but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing,
