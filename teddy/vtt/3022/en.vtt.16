00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.313
so we decided to come up with a recipe
that involved those two things,

00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:06.248
and we challenged ourselves:

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:08.078
Could we get people to say,

00:08:08.102 --> 00:08:12.188
"Hey, BFF, let's see
if we can do this together"?

00:08:12.807 --> 00:08:16.142
The resulting video was
the "Fudgiest Brownies Ever" video.

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:19.090
It was enormously successful
in every metric possible --

00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:20.478
70 million views.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:24.635
And people said the exact things
that we were going after:

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:27.759
"Hey, Colette, we need to make these,
are you up for a challenge?"

00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:28.936
"Game on."

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.230
It did the job that it set out to do,
