Now, a reasonable person could have
any number of hypotheses.

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:33.281
Maybe people love baby animals.

00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:35.475
Maybe people love office pranks.

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.244
Maybe people love stories
about their bosses

00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:39.801
or birthday surprises.

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:44.082
But our team wasn't really thinking
about what the video was about.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.378
We were thinking about

00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:49.478
what the people watching the video
were thinking and feeling.

00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:54.285
We read some of the 82,000 comments
that were made during the video,

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.101
and we hypothesized that they were excited

00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:01.299
because they were participating
in the shared anticipation
