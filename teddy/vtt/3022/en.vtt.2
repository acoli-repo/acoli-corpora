90,000 viewers were watching
the livestream.

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.558
Now, our team had a lot
of discussion about this video

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:10.558
and why it was so successful.

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:13.458
It wasn't the biggest live video
that we had done to date.

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:17.124
The biggest one that we had done
involved a fountain of cheese.

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:21.888
But it performed so much better
than we had expected.

00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:26.175
What was it about the goats in the office
that we didn't anticipate?

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.839
Now, a reasonable person could have
any number of hypotheses.
