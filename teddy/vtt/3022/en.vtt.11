Let me give you some examples
of how this plays out.

00:05:32.578 --> 00:05:34.469
This is one of my favorite lists:

00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:37.796
"32 Memes You Should
Send Your Sister Immediately" --

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.122
immediately.

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:42.687
For example, "When you're going
through your sister's stuff,

00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:44.690
and you hear her coming up the stairs."

00:05:44.714 --> 00:05:46.504
Absolutely, I've done that.

00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:49.683
"Watching your sister get in trouble
for something that you did

00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:50.899
and blamed on her."

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:52.531
Yes, I've done that as well.

00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:54.354
This list got three million views.

00:05:54.378 --> 00:05:55.543
Why is that?

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:58.543
Because it did, very well, several jobs:

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.087
"This is us."
