Now, most media companies,
when they think about metadata,

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.594
they think about subjects or formats.

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:07.562
It's about goats,

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.362
it's about office pranks,

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:10.683
it's about food,

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:12.561
it's a list or a video or a quiz,

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:13.844
it's 2,000 words long,

00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:15.021
it's 15 minutes long,

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:18.167
it has 23 embedded tweets or 15 images.

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.203
Now, that kind of metadata
is mildly interesting,

00:03:21.227 --> 00:03:24.193
but it doesn't actually get at
what really matters.

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:28.375
What if, instead of tagging
what articles or videos are about,

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.589
what if we asked:

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:33.166
How is it helping our users
do a real job in their lives?
