This is my upbringing, this is my culture,

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:32.423
this is my fandom,
this is my guilty pleasure,

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.630
and this is how I laugh about myself."

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.482
"Helps me connect with another person."

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.917
This is one of the greatest
gifts of the internet.

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.132
It's amazing when you find
a piece of media

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:45.688
that precisely describes
your bond with someone.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.618
This is the group of jobs
that helps me do something --

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:51.019
helps me settle an argument,

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:53.716
helps me learn something
about myself or another person,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.596
or helps me explain my story.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.309
This is the group of jobs
that makes me feel something --

00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:01.490
makes me curious or sad
or restores my faith in humanity.
