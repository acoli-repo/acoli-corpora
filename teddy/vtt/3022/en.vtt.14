Age is a state of mind."

00:07:00.862 --> 00:07:03.912
This quiz was successful
not because it was accurate,

00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:07.990
but because it allowed these ladies
to do a very important job --

00:07:08.014 --> 00:07:09.218
the humblebrag.

00:07:10.478 --> 00:07:15.461
Now, we can even apply
this framework to recipes and food.

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:21.460
A recipe's normal job is to tell you
what to make for dinner or for lunch.

00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:25.613
And this is how you would normally
brainstorm for a recipe:

00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:27.960
you figure out what ingredients
you want to use,

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:29.152
what recipe that makes,

00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:32.421
and then maybe you slap a job on
at the end to sell it.
