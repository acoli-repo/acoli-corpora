in the shared anticipation

00:02:01.323 --> 00:02:04.053
of something that was about to happen.

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:07.289
They were part of a community,
just for an instant,

00:02:07.313 --> 00:02:08.666
and it made them happy.

00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:12.446
So we decided that we needed
to test this hypothesis.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:16.275
What could we do to test
this very same thing?

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:18.386
The following week,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.085

that food videos are very popular,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.680
we dressed two people in hazmat suits

00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:30.965
and wrapped rubber bands
around a watermelon until it exploded.
