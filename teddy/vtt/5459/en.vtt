In November 2015, 197 countries
came together in Paris

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.226
and agreed to pursue efforts

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.226
to limit the temperature increase
on our planet to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.101
The Climate Action Tracker
monitors the climate commitments

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:16.059
and actions of 36 countries,

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:20.351
totalling roughly 80 percent of today's
global greenhouse gas emissions.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:23.059
Here's the bad news:
those emissions are still rising

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:27.309
and have already warmed the globe
by 1.1 degrees Celsius.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.809
The tracker makes two problems clear.

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.434
First, countries have not
set emissions targets
