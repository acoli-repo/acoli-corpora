100 years ago,

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.654

00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:10.454
nearly 2,000 different varieties of plums

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.748
and almost 800 named varieties
of apples growing in the United States.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.820

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:22.115
and what is left is threatened
by industrialization of agriculture,

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:23.929

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:28.441
Those varieties that are threatened
include the Blood Cling,

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:33.186
a red-flesh peach brought
