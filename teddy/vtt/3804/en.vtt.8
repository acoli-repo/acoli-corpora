But there was a very small set of individuals

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:05.185
who also had very high levels of HIV.

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:06.571
They didn't get AIDS.

00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.533
And astute clinicians tracked that down,

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:12.920
and what they found was
they were carrying mutations.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.005
Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.020
that were protective, that were protecting them

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.661
from going on to get AIDS.

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.826
You may also know that actually a line of therapy

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.946
has been coming along based on that fact.

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:29.170
Second example, more recent, is elegant work
