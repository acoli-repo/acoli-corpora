00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.558
The project that we're working on

00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:03.020
is called "The Resilience Project:

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.420
A Search for Unexpected Heroes,"

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.910
because what we are interested in doing is saying,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.558
can we find those rare individuals

00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:13.883
who might have these hidden protective factors?

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:16.863
And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:18.789
a sort of resilience decoder ring

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.421
that we're going to try to build.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.270
We've realized that we should 
do this in a systematic way,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.897
so we've said, let's take every single

00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:28.140
childhood inherited disease.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.704
Let's take them all, and let's
pull them back a little bit
