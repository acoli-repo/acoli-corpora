00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.068
there's information that they gain

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.510
about the risk of going on to get this disease

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.736
or that disease.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:09.041
At the same time, if you ask,

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:11.748
"Has that impacted the efficiency,

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:13.840
how we've been able to develop drugs?"

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.622
the answer is not really.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:17.952
If you look at the cost of developing drugs,

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.341
how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:25.814
And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.626
yet not the power to fully treat.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.092
And there are two commonly given reasons
