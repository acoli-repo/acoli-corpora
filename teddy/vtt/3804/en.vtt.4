about this maybe in the wrong context?"

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.951
We do a lot of studying of those who are sick

and building up long lists

00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.669
of altered components.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.068

A vast majority of those people

are not necessarily carrying a particular
