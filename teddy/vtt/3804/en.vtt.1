00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:31.747
It propelled me to go on

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:35.279
and to co-lead a team that discovered

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:38.476
the first cancer susceptibility gene,

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.197
and in the intervening decades since then,

00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:44.617
there has been literally a seismic shift

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.643
in our understanding of what goes on,

00:00:46.643 --> 00:00:49.531
what genetic variations are sitting behind

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.090
various diseases.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.474
In fact, for thousands of human traits,

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:56.692
a molecular basis that's known for that,

00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:59.987
and for thousands of people, every day,

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.068
there's information that they gain
