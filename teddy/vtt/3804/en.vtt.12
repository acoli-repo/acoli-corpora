00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.511
Maybe we should look not just here

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:03.471
but in remote places where their might be

00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.501
a distinct genetic context,

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.143
there might be environmental factors

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:09.525
that protect people.

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:13.987
And let's look at a million individuals.

00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:16.957
Now the reason why we think it's a good time

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:18.029
to do that now

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.789
is, in the last couple of years,

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.377
there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost

00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:24.612
to do this type of analysis,

00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:26.351
this type of data generation,

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:28.959
to where it actually costs less to do

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.153
the data generation and analysis
