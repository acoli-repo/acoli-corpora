00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.880
are not necessarily carrying a particular

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.816
genetic load or risk factor.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.800
They're not going to help us.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.399
There are going to be those individuals

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.068
who are carrying a potential future risk,

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.912
they're going to go on to get some symptom.

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.700
That's not what we're looking for.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.548
What we're asking and looking for is,

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.318
are there a very few set of individuals

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.154
who are actually walking around

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:55.173
with the risk that normally would cause a disease,

00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.136
but something in them, something hidden in them

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.970
is actually protective

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.145
and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?
