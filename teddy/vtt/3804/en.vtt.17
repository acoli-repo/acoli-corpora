00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:30.440
So you must be going,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.065
"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.648
And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.

00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:41.686
We found dozens of these strong candidate

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:43.415
unexpected heroes.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:46.112
So we think that the time is now

00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:48.452
to launch the beta phase of this project

00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:51.569
and actually start getting prospective individuals.

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:54.740
Basically all we need is information.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.399
We need a swab of DNA

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.804
and a willingness to say, "What's inside me?

00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:03.067
I'm willing to be re-contacted."
