00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.704
Let's take them all, and let's
pull them back a little bit

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:33.890
by those that are known to have severe symptoms,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.810
where the parents, the child,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.860
those around them would know

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.190
that they'd gotten sick,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.890
and let's go ahead and then frame them again

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.471
by those parts of the genes where we know

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.978
that there is a particular alteration

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.776
that is known to be highly penetrant

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:52.430
to cause that disease.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.658
Where are we going to look?

00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:56.146
Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:58.407
But we began to think, maybe we should look

00:05:58.407 --> 00:05:59.858
all over the world.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.511
Maybe we should look not just here
