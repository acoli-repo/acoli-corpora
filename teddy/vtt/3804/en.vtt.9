00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.573
done by Helen Hobbs,

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:33.235
who said, "I'm going to look at individuals

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.951
who have very high lipid levels,

00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:37.890
and I'm going to try to find those people

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.692
with high lipid levels

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:41.860
who don't go on to get heart disease."

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.298
And again, what she found was

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:46.858
some of those individuals had mutations

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:49.577
that were protective from birth that kept them,

00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:51.022
even though they had high lipid levels,

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:54.393
and you can see this is an interesting way

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.354
of thinking about how you could develop

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:58.614
preventive therapies.

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.558
