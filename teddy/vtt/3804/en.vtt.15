00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:33.589
My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:36.895
at the Icahn Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York,

00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:38.287
and his team,

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:41.156
locked in that decoder key ring,

00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:43.551
and we began looking for samples,

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.037
because what we realized is,

00:07:45.037 --> 00:07:46.831
maybe we could just go and look

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:49.917
at some existing samples to
get some sense of feasibility.

00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:52.494
Maybe we could take two, three 
percent of the project on,

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:53.911
and see if it was there.

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:55.909
And so we started asking people

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.446
such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.691
We asked Leif up in Finland.
