00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:02.940
Approximately 30 years ago,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.633
when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.022
in Philadelphia,

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.176
a father and a son walked into my office

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.320
and they both had their right eye missing,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.131
and as I took the history, it became apparent

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:18.900
that the father and the son had a rare form

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.442
of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.556
and the father knew that he had passed that fate

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.431
on to his son.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.843
That moment changed my life.

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:31.747
It propelled me to go on
