00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.145
and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:05.198
If you're going to do a study
like that, you can imagine

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.030
you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.322
We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.057
and we realized that actually

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.586
one way to think of this is,

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:18.863
let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.833
and let's make sure that we look at those

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.313
who were healthy as kids.

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:25.715
They might have had individuals in their families

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:27.527
who had had a childhood disease,

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:29.033
but not necessarily.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.800
And let's go and then screen those
