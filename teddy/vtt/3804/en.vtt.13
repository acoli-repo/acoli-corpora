00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.153
the data generation and analysis

00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:34.337
than it does to do the sample
processing and the collection.

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:38.641
The other reason is that in the last five years,

00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.605
there have been awesome tools,

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:43.267
things about network biology, systems biology,

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.228
that have come up that allow us to think

00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:47.168
that maybe we could decipher

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.649
those positive outliers.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.821
And as we went around talking to researchers

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.725
and institutions

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.294
and telling them about our story,

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:56.961
something happened.

00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.190
They started saying, "This is interesting.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.537
I would be glad to join your effort.
