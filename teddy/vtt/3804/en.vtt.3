00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.092
And there are two commonly given reasons

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:32.560
for why that happens.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.032
One of them is it's early days.

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:39.622
We're just learning the words, the fragments,

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:41.398
the letters in the genetic code.

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:43.553
We don't know how to read the sentences.

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.123
We don't know how to follow the narrative.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:48.602
The other reason given is that

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:50.820
most of those changes are a loss of function,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.745
and it's actually really hard to develop drugs

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.660
that restore function.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.842
But today, I want us to step back

00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:59.870
and ask a more fundamental question,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.059
and ask, "What happens if we're thinking
