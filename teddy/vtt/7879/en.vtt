A few months ago,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.668
I surrendered the password
to my Twitter account

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:09.922
to let a person with paralysis
tweet out their thoughts.

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:12.633
But I mean that literally.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.720
Philip O'Keefe can't use
his fingers to type like you or I,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:18.473
but thanks to a tiny brain implant,

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:21.225
he was able to send the following tweets.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.189
"Hello world! Short tweet.
Monumental progress."

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.942
"No need for keystrokes or voices.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.528
I created this tweet just by thinking it."
