00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.840
It all happened for me about 30 years ago
when I was in graduate school,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.056
and a bunch of us graduate students
got together one day,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.736
and we said, you know,
there's an explosion

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.496
of writing and thinking
in feminist theory,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.416
but there's no courses yet.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.774
So we did what graduate students
typically do in a situation like that.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.456
We said, OK, let's have a study group.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.056
We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.656
we'll have a potluck dinner.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.176
(Laughter)

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.696
So every week,
11 women and me got together.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.496
(Laughter)
