Even within Europe, those countries
that are more gender equal

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.159
also have the highest levels of happiness.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.000
It is also good for companies.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.456
Research by Catalyst and others
has shown conclusively

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.096
that the more gender-equal companies are,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.336
the better it is for workers,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.176
the happier their labor force is.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.056
They have lower job turnover.
They have lower levels of attrition.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.416
They have an easier time recruiting.
