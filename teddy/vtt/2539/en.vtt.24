00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.136
we often have two phrases
that we use to describe what we do.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.696
We pitch in and we help out.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.936
(Laughter)

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.856
And I'm going to propose
something a little bit more radical,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.096
one word: "share."

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.856
(Laughter)

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.536
Because here's what the data show:

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.856
when men share housework and childcare,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.960
their children do better in school.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.216
Their children have lower rates
of absenteeism,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.776
higher rates of achievement.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.536
They are less likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.416
They are less likely
to see a child psychiatrist.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.560
They are less likely
to be put on medication.
