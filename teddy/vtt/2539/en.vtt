I'm here to recruit men
to support gender equality.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.616
(Cheers)

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.280
Wait, wait. What?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.496
What do men have to do
with gender equality?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.496
Gender equality is about women, right?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.040
I mean, the word gender is about women.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.496
Actually, I'm even here speaking
as a middle class white man.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.416
Now, I wasn't always
a middle class white man.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.840
It all happened for me about 30 years ago
when I was in graduate school,
