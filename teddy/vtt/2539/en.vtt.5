00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.776
so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.536
(Laughter)

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.896
And somebody said,
"Well what was that reaction?"

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.576
And I said, "Well, when I wake up
in the morning and I look in the mirror,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.496
I see a human being.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.976
I'm kind of the generic person.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.016
You know, I'm a middle class white man.
I have no race, no class, no gender.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.056

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.896
(Laughter)

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.656
So I like to think that was the moment
I became a middle class white man,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.616
that class and race and gender
were not about other people,
