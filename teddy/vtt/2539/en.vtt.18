They have higher rates of retention,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.616
higher rates of productivity.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.496

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:16.336

So it is good for business.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.280

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.016
It is good for the kind of lives
we want to live,
