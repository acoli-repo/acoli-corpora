00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.456
We were flummoxed by this.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.656
We could not figure this out.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.616
(Laughter)

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.776
Well, I decided to do a little experiment
with my 16-year old son.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.256
He had a bunch of his friends
hanging out at the house

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.576
watching a game on TV recently.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.816
So I decided I would pose
this riddle to them,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.816
just to see, to gauge the level of change.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.896
Well, 16-year-old boys,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.936
they immediately turned to me
and said, "It's his mom." Right?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.736
No problem. Just like that.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.616
Except for my son, who said,
"Well, he could have two dads."

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.136
(Laughter) (Applause)
