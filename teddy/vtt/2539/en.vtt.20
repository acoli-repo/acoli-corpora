When I was a lot younger,
there was a riddle that was posed to us.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.616
Some of you may wince
to remember this riddle.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.216
This riddle went something like this.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.576
A man and his son
are driving on the freeway,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.576
and they're in a terrible accident,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.856
and the father is killed,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.936
and the son is brought
to the hospital emergency room,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.016
and as they're bringing the son
into the hospital emergency room,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.656
the emergency room attending physician
sees the boy and says,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.016
"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.400
How is this possible?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.456
We were flummoxed by this.
