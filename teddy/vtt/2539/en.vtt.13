00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.120
"A Black Woman Stole My Job."

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.936
And they all told their stories,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.096
qualified for jobs,
qualified for promotions,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.456
didn't get it, really angry.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.256
And then it was my turn to speak,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.856
and I said, "I have
just one question for you guys,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.496
and it's about the title of the show,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.376
'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.296
Actually, it's about
one word in the title.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.856
I want to know about the word 'my.'

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.560
Where did you get the idea
it was your job?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.576
Why isn't the title of the show,
'A Black Woman Got the Job?'

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.056
or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"
