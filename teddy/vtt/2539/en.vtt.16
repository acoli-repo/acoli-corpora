If you listen to what men say
about what they want in their lives,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.936
gender equality is actually a way
for us to get the lives we want to live.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.496
Gender equality is good for countries.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.576
It turns out, according to most studies,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.576
that those countries
that are the most gender equal

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.136
are also the countries that score highest
on the happiness scale.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.536
And that's not just because
they're all in Europe.
