that class and race and gender
were not about other people,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.176

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.376
I had to start thinking about them,

So she gives a guest lecture
for me when I teach.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.896
I give a guest lecture
for her when she teaches.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.256
So I walk into her class
to give a guest lecture,
