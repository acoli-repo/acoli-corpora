00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.536
Because when I wake up in the morning
and I look in the mirror," she said,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.936
"I see a black woman.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.040
To me, race is visible. But to you,
race is invisible. You don't see it."

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.455
And then she said
something really startling.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.320
She said, "That's how privilege works.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it."

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.936
It is a luxury, I will say
to the white people sitting in this room,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.696
not to have to think about race
every split second of our lives.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.671
Now remember, I was
the only man in this group,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.776
so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."
