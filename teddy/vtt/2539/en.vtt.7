00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.256
So I walk into her class
to give a guest lecture,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.456
about 300 students in the room,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.816
and as I walk in, one of the students
looks up and says,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.200
"Oh, finally, an objective opinion."

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.976
All that semester, whenever
my colleague opened her mouth,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.376
what my students saw was a woman.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.496
I mean, if you were to say to my students,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.976
"There is structural inequality
based on gender in the United States,"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.016
they'd say, "Well of course
you'd say that.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.517
You're a woman. You're biased."

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.416
When I say it, they go,
"Wow, is that interesting.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440
Is that going to be on the test?
How do you spell 'structural'?"
