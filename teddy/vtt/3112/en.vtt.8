00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.200
isirika began to become small.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.536
It dissipated

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.080
and then just disappeared.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.336
In each place,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.296
I gained a new vocabulary.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.760
The vocabulary of donors and recipients.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.456
The vocabulary of measuring impact,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.320
return on investment ...

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.360
projects and programs.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.576
Communities such as my childhood community

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.520
became referred to
as "poor, vulnerable populations."
