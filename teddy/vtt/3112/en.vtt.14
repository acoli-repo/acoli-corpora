00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.376
we have one planet

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.656
and we don't have two choices about that.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.336
So there's not going to be a wall
that is high enough

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.936
to separate humanity.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.776
So give up the walls.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.056
Give them up.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.816
(Applause)

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.216
And we don't have a planet B to go to.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.976
So that's really important.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.416
Make that clear;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.976
move onto the next stage.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.160
The second stage: remember,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.160
in isirika, every idea counts.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.976
Bridges have big posters
