00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.976
that they could quickly assess
within the community and with others,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.536
what were the short-term needs
and what were the long-term needs.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.136
And I tell you,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.896
long after the lights
have gone off Mexico,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.376
Semillas will be there

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.896
with the communities, with the women,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.896
for a very long time.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.296
And that's what I'm talking about:

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.896
when we are able to support
the ideas of communities

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.960
that are rooted within their own setting.
