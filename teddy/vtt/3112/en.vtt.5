00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.376
a sick neighbor's home --

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160
and harvest their crop for them.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.056
I tagged alongside with my mother
to community events

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.056
and to women's events,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.056
and had the conversation
about vaccinations in school,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.816
building the health center

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.096
and really big things --

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.320
renewing seeds for the next
planting season.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.896
And often, the community
would come together

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.136
to contribute money
to send a neighbor's child to school --
