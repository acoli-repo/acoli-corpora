00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.896
When you begin that you're human together,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.240
you see each other differently.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.776
You don't see a refugee first

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.416
and you don't see a woman first

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.656
and you don't see
a person with disability first.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.576
You see a human being first.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.896
That is the essence
of seeing a person first.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.776
And when you do that,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.016
you value their ideas,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.896
you value their contribution --

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.400
small or big.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.080
And you value what
they bring to the table.
