00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.560
My mother was a philanthropist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.176
And now I know you're asking --

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.736
let me give you the answer:
yes, a little bit like Melinda Gates --

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.976
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.936
but with a lot less money.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.440
(Laughter)

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.776
She carried out her philanthropy
in our community

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400
through a practice we call, "isirika."

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.216
She supported the education
of scores of children

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.176
and invited many
to live with us in our home
