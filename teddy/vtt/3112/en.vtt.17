We could use that wisdom today,
I think, in every culture,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.520
in every place,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.320
passing to the next generation
what we could do together.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.535
I have,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.135
over the years,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.080
encountered isirika in many places,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.576
but what gives me really the passion today

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.416
to embrace isirika

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.736
is the work that I do
with women all over the world

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.016
through the Global Fund for Women,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.496
though women's funds

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.240
and through women's movements globally.
