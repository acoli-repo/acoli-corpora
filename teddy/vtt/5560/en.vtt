Symmetry is everywhere in nature,

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:12.184
and we usually associate it with beauty:

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.831
a perfectly shaped leaf,

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.571
or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.197
But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too,

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:23.130
and more common than you might think,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.707
from crabs with one giant pincer claw

00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:30.629
to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction.
