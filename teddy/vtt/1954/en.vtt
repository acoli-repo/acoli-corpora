00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.067
So what does it mean
for a machine to be athletic?

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.884
We will demonstrate the concept
of machine athleticism

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:19.604
and the research to achieve it

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:22.486
with the help of these flying machines
called quadrocopters,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.557
or quads, for short.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.184
Quads have been around for a long time.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.778
They're so popular these days
because they're mechanically simple.
