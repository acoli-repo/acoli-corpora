00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.113
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,

00:00:03.113 --> 00:00:05.102
and when I was 13, I convinced

00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:06.832
one of the largest toy companies,

00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:09.235
toymakers, in the world, Hasbro,

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:11.193
to change the way that they marketed

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:13.319
one of their most best-selling products.

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:14.639
So allow me to tell you about it.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.456
So I have a brother, Gavin.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:18.875
When this whole shebang happened, he was four.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.388
He loved to cook.

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.606
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.746
and mixing them into these, needless to say,

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:26.135
uneatable concoctions,

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.176
or making invisible macaroni and cheese.

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:32.325
He wanted to be a chef really badly.
