00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(Laughter)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And you're on the outside, you're at home.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You're like the Raspyni Brothers,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where you've got your balls in cold water. And --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Laughter) --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.
