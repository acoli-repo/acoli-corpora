00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.583
Where do you come from?

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:04.654
It's such a simple question,

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:06.837
but these days, of course,
simple questions

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.883
bring ever more complicated answers.

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:12.835
People are always asking
me where I come from,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.015
and they're expecting me to say India,

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.116
and they're absolutely right
insofar as 100 percent

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.682
of my blood and ancestry
does come from India.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.747
Except, I've never lived
one day of my life there.

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.155
I can't speak even one word

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.155
of its more than 22,000 dialects.
