00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
where the power dynamics between men and women

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000

became the majority of the American workforce.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
doctors, lawyers,
