Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:04.051
(Cheering)

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:05.491
Not good enough.

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.880
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.825
(Loud cheering)

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.350
My name is Maysoon Zayid,

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.238
and I am not drunk,

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:16.929
but the doctor who delivered me was.

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:20.483
He cut my mom six different times

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:23.293
in six different directions,

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.561
suffocating poor little me in the process.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:28.553
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:31.355
which means I shake all the time.
