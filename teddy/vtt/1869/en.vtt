As a student of adversity,

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:09.617
I've been struck over the years
by how some people with major challenges

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.979
seem to draw strength from them.

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.586
And I've heard the popular wisdom
that that has to do with finding meaning.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.401
And for a long time,

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.800
I thought the meaning was out there,

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.303
some great truth waiting to be found.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.535
But over time,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.103
I've come to feel
that the truth is irrelevant.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.776
We call it "finding meaning,"
