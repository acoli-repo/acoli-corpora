00:09:57.581 --> 00:10:00.450
And I can communicate the difference
between Buenos Aires

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:04.616
and Berlin,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.576
two cities I know very well.

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.785
It was precisely in Berlin
where my work became more colorful,

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:17.132
more expressive,

00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:20.332
more precise at telling stories.

00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.079
Everything I couldn't say
at those parties,

00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:26.853
standing there holding my glass of wine,

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:30.816
exploded in shapes and colors on paper.
