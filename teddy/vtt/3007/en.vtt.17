And of course, there's Alice,
looking at her wonderland.

00:08:35.444 --> 00:08:41.636
Drawing the letters of this title,
I recreate the text's atmosphere a little.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.375
I let the reader see the story
through a peephole in the door.

00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:49.181
To do that, I gave shape
to concepts and ideas

00:08:49.205 --> 00:08:51.156
that already exist in our imagination:

00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:53.413
the idea of dreams,

00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:55.333
of chaos,

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.314
the concept of wonder.
