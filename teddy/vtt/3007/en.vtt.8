The shapes of letters helped me
understand my surroundings better

00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:02.984
and navigate the city.

00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:05.469
I was in Paris recently,

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:07.685
and something similar happened to me.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.808
After a few days in the city,

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.409
I was on the lookout for something
tasty to take back home.

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:18.380
So I walked and walked and walked
until I found the perfect bakery.

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:20.769
The sign said it all.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.444
[Bakery]

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:25.567
I see it, and even today,
I imagine the master baker

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:28.503
dedicating the same amount of time
to each loaf of bread

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:31.654
that the craftsman dedicated
to each letter of this word.
