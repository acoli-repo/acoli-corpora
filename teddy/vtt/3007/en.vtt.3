00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:33.572
If we think about it,
our days are full of letters.

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:35.632
We see them on the front of the bus,

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:37.878
on the bakery's facade,

00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:39.841
on the keyboard we write on,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.608
on our cell phones --

00:01:41.632 --> 00:01:43.107
everywhere.

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.072
Since the beginning of history,

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:49.415
people have felt the need
to give language an image.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.095
And rightly so,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.575
because language is the most important
communication tool we have.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:59.506
Without understanding what a word means,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.994
we can see certain things it conveys.
