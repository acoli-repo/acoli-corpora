00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.824
When I moved to Berlin,
I experienced firsthand

00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:41.242
all the impact that drawn letters
can have in our day-to-day life.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.183
I arrived in a new city, which was
exciting and novel for me.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:52.908

was at times very frustrating

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:54.345
and uncomfortable.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:59.079
I found myself several times at parties
clutching my glass of wine,

00:02:59.103 --> 00:03:03.756
without understanding a single word
of what was being said around me.
