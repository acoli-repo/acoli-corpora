00:06:56.847 --> 00:07:01.719
Or how would it look, considering
this book has so much gibberish,

00:07:01.743 --> 00:07:05.579
if I combined both universes
in a single arrangement:

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:11.700
rigid letters and smooth letters
living together in the same composition.

00:07:13.496 --> 00:07:16.716
I like this idea,
and I'll work on it in detail.

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:21.873
I use another sheet of paper
to work more comfortably.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.752
I mark some guidelines,

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:28.740
delimiting the framework
where the words will be.

00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:32.548
There, I can start giving
form to each letter.
