00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:31.654
that the craftsman dedicated
to each letter of this word.

00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:36.206
I can see the bread,
with just the right ingredients,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.688
being kneaded softly and carefully,

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:42.816
in the same way the craftsman
drew the ends of the letters

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.523
with smooth and precise curves.

00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:51.688
I see the master baker placing
the buns over a thin layer of flour

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:53.664
so the bottoms don't burn.

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:58.783
I think of the craftsman putting
the mosaics in the oven one by one,

00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:00.913
being careful to not let the ink run.
