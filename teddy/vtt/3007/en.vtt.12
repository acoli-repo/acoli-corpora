00:05:58.388 --> 00:06:02.956
A while back, I was commissioned
to design the cover of a classic book,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.994
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:07.739
Alice falls in a burrow

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:11.001
and begins an absurd journey
through a world of fantasy, remember?

00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:17.144
In this situation, the title of the story
is my raw material.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:22.340
At first glance, there are elements
that are not very important,

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.248
and I can decide to make them smaller.

00:06:24.272 --> 00:06:28.467
For example, I'll write "in"
on a smaller scale.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.249
Then I'll try some other ideas.
