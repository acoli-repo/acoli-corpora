And there comes a point when
the drawing turns into precise forms,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.992
with colors, volumes
and decorative elements.

00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:11.089
Alice, the celebrity here,
is placed at the front

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:12.721
with volume in her letters.

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:16.743
Lots of points and lines
playing in the background

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:20.700
help me convey that in this story,
lots of things happen.

00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:23.149
And it helps to represent
the feeling it generates,

00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:25.681
as if you had your head in the clouds.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:33.384
And of course, there's Alice,
looking at her wonderland.
