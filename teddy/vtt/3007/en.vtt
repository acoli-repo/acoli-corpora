Can you imagine what the word
"TED" would have looked like

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:06.278
if it had existed during the Roman Empire?

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:10.297
I think maybe something like this.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.520
An artisan would have spent days
in the sun chiseling it into stone.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.648
And in the Middle Ages?

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:26.845
A monk, locked in his room,

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.439
would write T-E-D with his pen.
