00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.160
and to tell stories with the exact
tone and gesture I want.

00:11:03.957 --> 00:11:05.789
No more, no less.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.618
That's why I combine colors,

00:11:11.487 --> 00:11:13.002
textures

00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:15.556
and of course, letters,

00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:17.970
which are the heart.

00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:23.079
And that's why I always want them to have
shapes that are truly beautiful

00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:25.677
and exquisite.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:29.583
Telling stories by drawing letters --

00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:31.049
that's my job.
