What if, to communicate
the idea of "wonder,"

00:06:33.858 --> 00:06:36.926
I used my best handwriting,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.147
with lots of curleycues here and there?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.721
Or what if I focused more on the fact
that the book is a classic

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:48.094
and used more conventional lettering,

00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:51.998
making everything look
a little more stiff and serious,

00:06:52.022 --> 00:06:55.258

00:06:56.847 --> 00:07:01.719
Or how would it look, considering
this book has so much gibberish,
