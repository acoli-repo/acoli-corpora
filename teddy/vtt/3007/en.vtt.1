how would these letters
have looked in the 80s?

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:44.536
They would have had
electric, strange colors,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.227
just like our hairstyles.

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.885
(Laughter)

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:51.377
If this event were about children,

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.680
I would draw the letters like this,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.985
as if they were building blocks,

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:00.474
in vivid colors.
