00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.994
we can see certain things it conveys.

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:05.881
Some letters tell us
that something is modern --

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.273
at least it was back in the 70s.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:15.047
Others verify the importance
and monumentality of a place,

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.764
and they do so in uppercase.

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:20.229
There are letters not made to last long --

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:23.531
and neither is the opportunity
they communicate.

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:27.427
And there are letters made
by inexperienced hands

00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.150
that, whether they mean to or not,

00:02:29.174 --> 00:02:31.744
make us imagine
what a place looks like inside.
