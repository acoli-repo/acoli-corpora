00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.046
The human voice:

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.634
It's the instrument we all play.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.069
It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably.

What I'd like to suggest,

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.666
there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.420
I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.852
I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list,
