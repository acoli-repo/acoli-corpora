00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:32.848
so cells are protected from viruses
not only in one generation,

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:35.221
but over many generations of cells.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:39.530
This allows the cells
to keep a record of infection,

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:42.493
and as my colleague,
Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:47.473
the CRISPR locus is effectively
a genetic vaccination card in cells.

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:53.070
Once those bits of DNA have been inserted
into the bacterial chromosome,

00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:57.293
the cell then makes a little copy
of a molecule called RNA,

00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:59.332
which is orange in this picture,

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:04.073
that is an exact replicate
of the viral DNA.
