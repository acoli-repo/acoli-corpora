00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:35.818
at the position at or near a mutation
causing cystic fibrosis, for example,

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:39.347
we could trigger cells
to repair that mutation.

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:45.567
Genome engineering is actually not new,
it's been in development since the 1970s.

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.342
We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.961
for copying DNA,

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:52.365
and even for manipulating DNA.

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.105
And these technologies
were very promising,

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.535
but the problem was
that they were either inefficient,
