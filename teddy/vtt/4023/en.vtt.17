00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:31.134
affect either a tissue or,
in this case, an entire organism.

00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:32.722
Now in this example,

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:36.539
the CRISPR technology
was used to disrupt a gene

00:08:36.563 --> 00:08:39.330
by making a tiny change in the DNA

00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:43.798
in a gene that is responsible
for the black coat color of these mice.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.237
Imagine that these white mice
differ from their pigmented litter-mates

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:53.928
by just a tiny change at one gene
in the entire genome,

00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:55.942
and they're otherwise completely normal.

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:58.857
And when we sequence the DNA
from these animals,

00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:01.507
we find that the change in the DNA
