00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.961
it makes a double-stranded break
in the DNA helix.

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:06.967
And importantly,
this complex is programmable,

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:12.191
so it can be programmed to recognize
particular DNA sequences,

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.242
and make a break in the DNA at that site.

00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.508
As I'm going to tell you now,

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:22.308
we recognized that that activity
could be harnessed for genome engineering,

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:26.559
to allow cells to make
a very precise change to the DNA

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:29.055
at the site where
this break was introduced.

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:30.773
That's sort of analogous
