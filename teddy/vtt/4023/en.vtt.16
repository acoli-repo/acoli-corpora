I actually think that the first
applications of the CRISPR technology

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.668
are going to happen in the blood,

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.445
where it's relatively easier
to deliver this tool into cells,

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:10.590
compared to solid tissues.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:14.309
Right now, a lot of the work
that's going on

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:18.302
applies to animal models
of human disease, such as mice.

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:21.595
The technology is being used to make
very precise changes

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:26.790
that allow us to study the way
that these changes in the cell's DNA

00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:31.134
affect either a tissue or,
in this case, an entire organism.
