00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.535
but the problem was
that they were either inefficient,

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.892
or they were difficult enough to use

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:07.718
that most scientists had not adopted them
for use in their own laboratories,

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:11.907
or certainly for many
clinical applications.

00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:19.722
So, the opportunity to take a technology
like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.102
because of its relative simplicity.

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:26.895
We can think of older
genome engineering technologies

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.578
as similar to having
to rewire your computer
