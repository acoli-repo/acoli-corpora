00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:04.073
that is an exact replicate
of the viral DNA.

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:06.838
RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:10.815
and it allows interaction
with DNA molecules

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.838
that have a matching sequence.

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:17.167
So those little bits of RNA
from the CRISPR locus

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.980
associate -- they bind --
to protein called Cas9,

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:22.939
which is white in the picture,

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:27.182
and form a complex that functions
like a sentinel in the cell.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.620
It searches through all
of the DNA in the cell,
