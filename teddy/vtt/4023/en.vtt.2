00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.089
that's able to seek out, cut
and eventually degrade viral DNA

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:04.375
in a specific way.

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:06.556
And it was through our research

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.237
to understand the activity
of this protein, Cas9,

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.092
that we realized that we could
harness its function

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:16.522
as a genetic engineering technology --

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:23.497
a way for scientists to delete or insert
specific bits of DNA into cells

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.552
with incredible precision --

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:27.243
that would offer opportunities

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.339
to do things that really haven't
been possible in the past.
