00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:02.463
A few years ago,

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:05.257
with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.539
I invented a new technology
for editing genomes.

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:11.207
It's called CRISPR-Cas9.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.446
The CRISPR technology allows
scientists to make changes

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.325
to the DNA in cells

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.255
that could allow us
to cure genetic disease.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:22.688
You might be interested to know

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.496
that the CRISPR technology came about
through a basic research project

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.463
that was aimed at discovering
how bacteria fight viral infections.
