WEBVTT

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.620
It searches through all
of the DNA in the cell,

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:34.896
to find sites that match
the sequences in the bound RNAs.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.555
And when those sites are found --

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.049
as you can see here,
the blue molecule is DNA --

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.922
this complex associates with that DNA

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:48.248
and allows the Cas9 cleaver
to cut up the viral DNA.

00:04:48.272 --> 00:04:50.628
It makes a very precise break.

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:56.496
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA
sentinel complex

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.701
like a pair of scissors
that can cut DNA --

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.961
it makes a double-stranded break
in the DNA helix.
