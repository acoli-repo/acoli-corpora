What I want to do now is tell you
what the CRISPR technology is,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.473
what it can do,

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:35.742
where we are today

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.788
and why I think we need to take
a prudent path forward

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.165
in the way that we employ this technology.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.831
When viruses infect a cell,
they inject their DNA.

00:02:47.363 --> 00:02:48.839
And in a bacterium,

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:53.728
the CRISPR system allows that DNA
to be plucked out of the virus,

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:57.597
and inserted in little bits
into the chromosome --

00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.571
the DNA of the bacterium.

00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:05.287
And these integrated bits of viral DNA
get inserted at a site called CRISPR.
