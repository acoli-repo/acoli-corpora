that we should actually pause this
for a moment and think about it?

00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:04.055
Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues
were actually, I think, delighted

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:06.324
to have the opportunity
to discuss this openly.

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:08.694
It's interesting that as I talk to people,

00:13:08.718 --> 00:13:11.186
my scientific colleagues
as well as others,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.520
there's a wide variety
of viewpoints about this.

00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:17.218
So clearly it's a topic that needs
careful consideration and discussion.

00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:19.457
BG: There's a big meeting
happening in December

00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:21.457
that you and your colleagues are calling,

00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.248
together with the National Academy
of Sciences and others,

00:13:24.272 --> 00:13:27.564
what do you hope will come
out of the meeting, practically?

00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.954
JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views

00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:33.578
of many different individuals
and stakeholders
