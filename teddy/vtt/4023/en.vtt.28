00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:01.249
So that's kind of the other
school of thought,

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:04.421
that we should actually use
this opportunity and really go for it.

00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:08.223
Is there a possible split happening
in the science community about this?

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.707
I mean, are we going to see
some people holding back

00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:12.525
because they have ethical concerns,

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:14.236
and some others just going forward

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.556
because some countries under-regulate
or don't regulate at all?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.425
JD: Well, I think with any new technology,
especially something like this,

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:24.234
there are going to be
a variety of viewpoints,

00:14:24.258 --> 00:14:27.599
and I think that's
perfectly understandable.

00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:29.135
I think that in the end,

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:34.110
this technology will be used
for human genome engineering,
