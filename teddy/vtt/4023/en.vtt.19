00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.477
We also want to understand better

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:34.128
how to control the way
that DNA is repaired after it's cut,

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:39.833
and also to figure out how to control
and limit any kind of off-target,

00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:43.094
or unintended effects
of using the technology.

00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:50.506
I think that we will see
clinical application of this technology,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.042
certainly in adults,

00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.669
within the next 10 years.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.827
I think that it's likely
that we will see clinical trials

00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.280
and possibly even approved
therapies within that time,
