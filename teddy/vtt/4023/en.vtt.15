00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.578
as similar to having
to rewire your computer

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:34.372
each time you want to run
a new piece of software,

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:38.160
whereas the CRISPR technology
is like software for the genome,

00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:41.670
we can program it easily,
using these little bits of RNA.

00:07:42.658 --> 00:07:45.751
So once a double-stranded
break is made in DNA,

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:47.862
we can induce repair,

00:07:47.886 --> 00:07:51.332
and thereby potentially achieve
astounding things,

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:55.515
like being able to correct mutations
that cause sickle cell anemia

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.890
or cause Huntington's Disease.

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:01.375
I actually think that the first
applications of the CRISPR technology
