00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:30.773
That's sort of analogous

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.505
to the way that we use
a word-processing program

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.809
to fix a typo in a document.

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.359
The reason we envisioned using
the CRISPR system for genome engineering

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:46.002
is because cells have the ability
to detect broken DNA

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:47.218
and repair it.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.711
So when a plant or an animal cell detects
a double-stranded break in its DNA,

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.332
it can fix that break,

00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:57.883
either by pasting together
the ends of the broken DNA

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:02.017
with a little, tiny change
in the sequence of that position,
