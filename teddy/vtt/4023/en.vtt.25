Your attitude about asking for a pause
or a moratorium or a quarantine

00:12:31.824 --> 00:12:33.844
is incredibly responsible.

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:37.281
There are, of course,
the therapeutic results of this,

00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:39.455
but then there are the un-therapeutic ones

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.659
and they seem to be the ones
gaining traction,

00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:42.929
particularly in the media.

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:47.119
This is one of the latest issues
of The Economist -- "Editing humanity."

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:50.962
It's all about genetic enhancement,
it's not about therapeutics.

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.823
What kind of reactions
did you get back in March

00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:55.864
from your colleagues in the science world,

00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:57.246
when you asked or suggested

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.586
that we should actually pause this
for a moment and think about it?
