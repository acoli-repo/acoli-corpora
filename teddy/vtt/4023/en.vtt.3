00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.339
to do things that really haven't
been possible in the past.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:33.246
The CRISPR technology
has already been used

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.354
to change the DNA in the cells
of mice and monkeys,

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.003
other organisms as well.

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:42.282
Chinese scientists showed recently

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.465
that they could even use
the CRISPR technology

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.118
to change genes in human embryos.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:50.285
And scientists in Philadelphia showed
they could use CRISPR

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:55.152
to remove the DNA
of an integrated HIV virus

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.371
from infected human cells.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:01.348
The opportunity to do this kind
of genome editing
