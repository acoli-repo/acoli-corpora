The opportunity to do this kind
of genome editing

00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.655
also raises various ethical issues
that we have to consider,

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.647
because this technology can be employed
not only in adult cells,

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.274
but also in the embryos of organisms,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.298
including our own species.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.765
And so, together with my colleagues,

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.277
I've called for a global conversation
about the technology that I co-invented,

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:25.841
so that we can consider all of the ethical
and societal implications

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.589
of a technology like this.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:32.995
What I want to do now is tell you
what the CRISPR technology is,
