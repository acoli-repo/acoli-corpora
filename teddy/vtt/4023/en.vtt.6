00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:05.287
And these integrated bits of viral DNA
get inserted at a site called CRISPR.

00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:12.027
CRISPR stands for clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.052
(Laughter)

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.449
A big mouthful -- you can see why
we use the acronym CRISPR.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.878
It's a mechanism that allows cells
to record, over time,

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.584
the viruses they have been exposed to.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:28.291
And importantly, those bits of DNA
are passed on to the cells' progeny,

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:32.848
so cells are protected from viruses
not only in one generation,
