00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:01.507
we find that the change in the DNA

00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.673
has occurred at exactly the place
where we induced it,

00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:06.459
using the CRISPR technology.

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:10.386
Additional experiments
are going on in other animals

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.505
that are useful for creating models
for human disease,

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:16.132
such as monkeys.

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:19.382
And here we find
that we can use these systems

00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:23.208
to test the application of this technology
in particular tissues,

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:28.305
for example, figuring out how to deliver
the CRISPR tool into cells.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.477
We also want to understand better
