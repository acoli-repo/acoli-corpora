00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.280
and possibly even approved
therapies within that time,

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:03.017
which is a very exciting thing
to think about.

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.542
And because of the excitement
around this technology,

00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:08.859
there's a lot of interest
in start-up companies

00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:13.645
that have been founded
to commercialize the CRISPR technology,

00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:15.158
and lots of venture capitalists

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.754
that have been investing

But we have to also consider

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:24.461
that the CRISPR technology can be used
for things like enhancement.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:27.529
Imagine that we could try
to engineer humans

00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:31.988
that have enhanced properties,
such as stronger bones,
