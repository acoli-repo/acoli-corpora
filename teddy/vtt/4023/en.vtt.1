00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.463
that was aimed at discovering
how bacteria fight viral infections.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.212
Bacteria have to deal with viruses
in their environment,

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:37.900
and we can think about a viral infection
like a ticking time bomb --

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.282
a bacterium has only a few minutes
to defuse the bomb

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:42.916
before it gets destroyed.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:48.674
So, many bacteria have in their cells
an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.344
that allows them to detect
viral DNA and destroy it.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.116
Part of the CRISPR system
is a protein called Cas9,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.089
that's able to seek out, cut
and eventually degrade viral DNA
