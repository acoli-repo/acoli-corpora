this technology will be used
for human genome engineering,

00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:38.451
but I think to do that without careful
consideration and discussion

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:41.412
of the risks and potential complications

00:14:41.436 --> 00:14:42.975
would not be responsible.

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:45.978
BG: There are a lot of technologies
and other fields of science

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:48.773
that are developing exponentially,
pretty much like yours.

00:14:48.797 --> 00:14:52.830
I'm thinking about artificial
intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.366
No one seems --

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.898
aside from autonomous warfare robots --

00:14:56.922 --> 00:15:01.627
nobody seems to have launched
a similar discussion in those fields,
