00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:31.988
that have enhanced properties,
such as stronger bones,

00:10:32.012 --> 00:10:36.083
or less susceptibility
to cardiovascular disease

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:37.618
or even to have properties

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:40.041
that we would consider maybe
to be desirable,

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:44.506
like a different eye color
or to be taller, things like that.

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.788
"Designer humans," if you will.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.170
Right now, the genetic information

00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:55.687
to understand what types of genes
would give rise to these traits

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:57.444
is mostly not known.

00:10:57.468 --> 00:10:58.714
But it's important to know

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:03.023
that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool
to make such changes,
