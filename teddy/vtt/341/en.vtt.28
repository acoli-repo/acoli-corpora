WEBVTT

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.812
but we can all be contributors

00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:02.871
to a global human rights economy.

00:14:02.871 --> 00:14:05.139
We can create a culture of transparency

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:06.463
and accountability to the laws,

00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:08.874
and make governments more accountable to us,

00:14:08.874 --> 00:14:11.897
as we are to them.

00:14:11.897 --> 00:14:13.889
A few months ago, a South African lawyer

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:15.644
visited me in my office

00:14:15.644 --> 00:14:17.569
and he said, "I wanted to meet you.

00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:21.563
I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."

00:14:21.563 --> 00:14:23.542
The laws are ours,

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:25.575
and no matter what your ethnicity,

00:14:25.575 --> 00:14:28.466
nationality, gender, race,

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:30.585
they belong to us,
