Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:05.233
He works for The New York Times,

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:06.850
and unfortunately, a few months ago

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.990
he wrote an article that displeased

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.296
people in the government.

00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:13.546
As a result, he was temporarily detained

00:08:13.546 --> 00:08:17.859
and he was illegally exiled out of the country.

00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:19.911
I represent Matt,

00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.039
and after dealing with the government,

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:23.719
I was able to get legal acknowledgment

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:26.780
that in fact he was illegally exiled,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.840
and that freedom of the
press does exist in Afghanistan,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.372
and there's consequences if that's not followed.
