00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.355
but she did know she had 
a certain level of protection

00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:02.982
by her government that failed her,

00:12:02.982 --> 00:12:04.584
and so we were able to talk about

00:12:04.584 --> 00:12:07.126

but until Sahar, had never been used.

00:12:26.443 --> 00:12:28.655
In addition to this, we also decided

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:30.378
to sue for civil damages,
