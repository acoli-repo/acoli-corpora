that sold Naghma off.

00:04:00.702 --> 00:04:03.404
And the third problem with achieving justness

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:06.216
is that even with good, existing laws on the books,

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:08.862
there aren't people or lawyers 
that are willing to fight

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:10.558
for those laws.

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.432
And that's what I do: I use existing laws,

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:15.231
often unused laws,

00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:18.865
and I work those to the benefits of my clients.

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:21.413
We all need to create a global culture

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:23.241
of human rights

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:25.990
and be investors in a global 
human rights economy,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.757
and by working in this mindset,

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:30.474
we can significantly improve justice globally.
