00:00:01.957 --> 00:00:03.518
Let me tell you a story

00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:06.724
about a little girl named Naghma.

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.546
Naghma lived in a refugee camp

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.425
with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:13.361
Every morning, her father would wake up

00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:15.801
in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.367
and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.755
The winter was very harsh,

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.439
and unfortunately, Naghma's brother died

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.359
and her mother became very ill.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.939
In desperation, her father went to a neighbor

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.336
to borrow 2,500 dollars.
