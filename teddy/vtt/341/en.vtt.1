00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.336
to borrow 2,500 dollars.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:32.250
After several months of waiting,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.767

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.485
and he demanded that he be paid back.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.929
Unfortunately, Naghma's
father didn't have the money,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.764

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:57.737
where there's deep-seated resentment

00:00:57.737 --> 00:00:59.999
against the formal system.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.337
At the jirga, the men sat together
