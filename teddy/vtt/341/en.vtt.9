00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:30.474
we can significantly improve justice globally.

00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:32.866
Now let's get back to Naghma.

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.265
Several people heard about this story,

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:36.790
and so they contacted me because they wanted

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.355
to pay the $2,500 debt.

00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:41.216
And it's not just that simple;

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:42.998
you can't just throw money at this problem

So I told them I'd get involved,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.318
but in order to get involved, 
what needed to happen

00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:55.141
is a second jirga needed to be called,

00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.250
a jirga of appeals.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.501
And so in order for that to happen,

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.206
we needed to get the village elders together,
