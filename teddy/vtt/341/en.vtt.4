00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:02.312
and I talked to hundreds of
people that were locked up,

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:03.910
and I talked to many businesses

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.440
that were also operating in Afghanistan.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.784
And within these conversations,

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.655
I started hearing the connections

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:11.645
between the businesses and the people,

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.715
and how laws that were meant to protect them

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.416
were being underused,

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:19.474
while gross and illegal punitive
measures were overused.

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:22.298
And so this put me on a quest for justness,

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:25.020
and what justness means to me

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.715
is using laws for their intended purpose,

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.040
which is to protect.
