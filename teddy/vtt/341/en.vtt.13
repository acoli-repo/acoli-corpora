00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:32.110
accused of being a spy.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.238
I've had a grenade thrown at my office.

00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:36.937
It didn't go off, though.

00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:38.537
But I find that with my job,

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:41.503
that the rewards far outweigh the risks,

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:43.877
and as many risks as I take,

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:45.846
my clients take far greater risks,

00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.349
because they have a lot more to lose

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.839
if their cases go unheard,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.962
or worse, if they're penalized
for having me as their lawyer.

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:53.736
With every case that I take,

00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:56.656
I realize that as much as
I'm standing behind my clients,

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:58.669
that they're also standing behind me,

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.462
and that's what keeps me going.
