00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.372
and there's consequences if that's not followed.

00:08:32.372 --> 00:08:34.118
And I'm happy to say that

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:36.206
as of a few days ago,

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.532
the Afghan government

00:08:37.532 --> 00:08:39.744
formally invited him back into the country

00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:43.377
and they reversed their exile order of him.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:47.016
(Applause)

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:51.252
If you censor one journalist, 
then it intimidates others,

00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:53.224
and soon nations are silenced.

00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:55.942
It's important that we protect our journalists

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:57.719
and freedom of the press,

00:08:57.719 --> 00:08:59.778
because that makes governments
more accountable to us

00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:01.763
and more transparent.
