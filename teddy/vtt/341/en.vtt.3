However, Afghanistan does have a legal system,

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:35.671
and while jirgas are built on
long-standing tribal customs,

00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.034
even in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.962

In that nine months, I went around the country

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:02.312
and I talked to hundreds of
people that were locked up,
