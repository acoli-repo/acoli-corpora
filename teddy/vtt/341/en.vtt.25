00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:30.378
to sue for civil damages,

00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:33.325
again using a law that's never been used,

00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:36.353
but we used it for her case.

00:12:36.353 --> 00:12:38.615
So there we were at the Supreme Court

00:12:38.615 --> 00:12:41.857
arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,

00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:44.493
me as an American female lawyer,

00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:47.980
and Sahar, a young woman

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.163
who when I met her couldn't 
speak above a whisper.

00:12:53.163 --> 00:12:54.834
She stood up,

00:12:54.834 --> 00:12:57.120
she found her voice,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.917
and my girl told them that she wanted justice,

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.556
and she got it.
