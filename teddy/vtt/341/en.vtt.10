00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:02.206
we needed to get the village elders together,

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.467
we needed to get the tribal leaders together,

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:06.056
the religious leaders.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.630
Naghma's father needed to agree,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.881
the neighbor needed to agree,

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:11.085
and also his son needed to agree.

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:15.110
And I thought, if I'm going to 
get involved in this thing,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.765
then they also need to agree 
that I preside over it.

00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:21.735
So, after hours of talking

00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:22.943
and tracking them down,

00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:25.806
and about 30 cups of tea,

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:27.718
they finally agreed that we could sit down

00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:31.050
for a second jirga, and we did.
