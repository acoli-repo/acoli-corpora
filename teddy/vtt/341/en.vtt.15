00:07:28.517 --> 00:07:31.363
since 2010, there have been 
thousands of journalists

00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:33.241
who have been threatened, injured,

00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:35.873
killed, detained.

00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:38.112
Too often, when we get this information,

00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:39.336
we forget who it affects

00:07:39.336 --> 00:07:42.634
or how that information is given to us.

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:45.244
What many journalists do, 
both foreign and domestic,

00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:49.315
is very remarkable, especially
in places like Afghanistan,

00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:50.887
and it's important that we never forget that,

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.243
because what they're protecting

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:54.525
is not only our right to receive that information

00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:56.582
but also the freedom of the press, which is vital

00:07:56.582 --> 00:07:59.458
to a democratic society.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:03.343
