00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:31.459
in the ways that they're intended to be used,

00:13:31.459 --> 00:13:33.940
and by protecting Sahar,

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.520
we are protecting ourselves.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.152
After having worked in Afghanistan

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.150
for over six years now,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.201
a lot of my family and friends think

00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:45.993
that what I do looks like this.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.499

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.790
I'm not saying we should all buy a
plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.812
but we can all be contributors
