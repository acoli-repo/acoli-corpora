00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:31.262
and use the laws in the ways

00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:33.998
that they're intended to be used.

00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:36.120
I find that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.536
achieving justness in places like Afghanistan

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:41.684
is difficult, and there's three reasons.

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:44.240
The first reason is that simply put,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.339
people are very uneducated as
to what their legal rights were,

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.930
and I find that this is a global problem.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.144
The second issue

00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:54.583
is that even with laws on the books,

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.848
it's often superseded or ignored

00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:59.170
by tribal customs, like in the first jirga

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.702
that sold Naghma off.
