WEBVTT

00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:31.050
for a second jirga, and we did.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.134
And what was different about the second jirga

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.709
is this time, we put the law at the center of it,

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.053
and it was very important for me

00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:38.811
that they all understood that Naghma

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:41.150
had a right to be protected.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.696
And at the end of this jirga,

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.989
it was ordered by the judge

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.825
that the first decision was erased,

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:52.257
and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,

00:05:52.257 --> 00:05:54.090
and we all signed a written order

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.481
where all the men acknowledged

00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.601
that what they did was illegal,

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:02.399
and if they did it again, that 
they would go to prison.
