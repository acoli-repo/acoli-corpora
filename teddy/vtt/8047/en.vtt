00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:03.300
"We're like family."

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:08.772
This is a phrase that's become
quite popular in our places of work

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:11.608
to try to make work
feel a little less like this

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:13.777
and a little bit more like this.

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:16.713
It's a phrase that started
in the last decade or two

00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:19.883
to try to elicit feelings
of warmth and belonging

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:22.286
and really that "cool culture" vibe.

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:26.924
The laid-back break rooms
with beanbag chairs and the beer on tap

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:30.661
and those tight-knit teams
that got through everything together
