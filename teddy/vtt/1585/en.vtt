00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One of my favorite parts

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of my job at the Gates Foundation

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is that I get to travel to the developing world,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I do that quite regularly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And when I meet the mothers

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in so many of these remote places,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm really struck by the things

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we have in common.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They want what we want for our children

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and that is for their children to grow up successful,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But I also see lots of poverty,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it's quite jarring,
