00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:30.192
but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.469
means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges --

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.504
which means lots of road congestion.

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:40.144
And these red dots show the most congested parts,

00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.721
which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.247
And then someone came up with the idea that,

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:47.084
apart from good public transport,

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.685
apart from spending money on roads,

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.900
let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.824
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,

00:02:56.824 --> 00:02:59.481
I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,

00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:02.199
so you would probably expect that car drivers
