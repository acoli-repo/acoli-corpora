00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:32.244
then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:34.704
But fortunately, it also works the other way around.

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:38.035
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion

00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:41.664
will go down much faster than you might think.

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:44.555
Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:49.159
on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.142
of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:56.955
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.

00:03:56.955 --> 00:03:59.875
This is what happens when you take away

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.940
20 percent of the cars from the streets.
