00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:01.339
This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.117
and you see the same street but now it's summer,

00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:04.861
and summer in Stockholm is a very nice

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.111
and light time of the year,

00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:09.954
and the first day without the congestion charges

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:11.321
looked like this.

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.984
All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:16.894
the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.

00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:19.141
The first day they all came back.

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:24.491
And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.822
Now these traffic figures are really exciting

00:05:26.822 --> 00:05:29.473
and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:32.232
but I would say that the most surprising slide here
