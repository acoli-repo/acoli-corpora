00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.625
they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.594
in January and then abolished again at the end of July,

00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:38.188
followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced

00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:42.388
again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.

00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:46.525
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,

00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:48.306
and we actually got to do it twice.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.415
And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.903
but they won't let me do that.

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.088
But it was fun anyway.

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:57.473
So, we followed up. What happened?

00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:01.339
