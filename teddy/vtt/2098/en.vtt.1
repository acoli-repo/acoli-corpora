00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:31.483
Anyway, the American cities:

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.411
lots of roads dispersed over large areas,

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.870
almost no public transportation.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.080
And then you have the emerging world cities,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.606
with a mixed variety of vehicles,

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.148
mixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.747
but often with a very dense urban core.

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:47.149
And traffic planners all around the world have tried

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.803
lots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.354
lots of roads or lots of public transport

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:56.140
or lots of bike lanes or more information,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.934
or lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.937
But all of these attempts have one thing in common.
