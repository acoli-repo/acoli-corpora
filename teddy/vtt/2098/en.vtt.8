00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.940
20 percent of the cars from the streets.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.650
You really reduce congestion quite substantially.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.308
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:10.810
So after a while they would all come back because they

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.758
have sort of gotten used to charges.

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:16.434
Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:18.417
since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:22.406
and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:24.677
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:26.140
in 2007.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.529
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.625
they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced
