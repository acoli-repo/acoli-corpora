00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.524
Which means that we are now in a position

00:07:31.524 --> 00:07:34.517
where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.728
with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:41.275
and people aren't even aware that they have changed,

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:45.186
and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:48.660
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.292
complex social problems, and when you do that,

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:54.922
you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:57.109
You should just nudge them in the right direction.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.831
And if you do it right,

00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:00.883
people will actually embrace the change,
