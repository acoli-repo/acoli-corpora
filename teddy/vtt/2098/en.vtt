Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion,

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:05.996
namely road congestion.

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.257
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:11.117
It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.065

I mean, think about how different cities are, actually.

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.790
I mean, you have the typical European cities,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.782
with a dense urban core, good public transportation

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.237
mostly, not a lot of road capacity.

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:25.686
But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:28.477
It's moving by itself, okay.

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:31.483
Anyway, the American cities:
