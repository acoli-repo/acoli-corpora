00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:02.199
so you would probably expect that car drivers

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.637
wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.

00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:05.937
You would be wrong.

00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:09.965
One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.349
disappear from rush hours.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.900
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.107
but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:19.976
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:23.243
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.935
a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:29.076
once you reach above a certain capacity threshold

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:32.244
then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
