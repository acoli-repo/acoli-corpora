00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.381
you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes."

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.269
The dictator is suspicious

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:37.652
but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything.

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:42.401
You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.656
But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit,

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:47.183
all the prisoners are gone,

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.881
each having asked to leave
the previous night.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.933
So how did you outsmart the dictator?

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:59.108
It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary.

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:04.178
Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill.
