00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.321
Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria.

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:34.340
The fact that the other person waited

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.124
tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.282
And on the second morning, 
they're both gone.

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:44.526
Now imagine a third prisoner.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:48.795
Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people,

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:53.905
but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people,

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.512
or just one.

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:57.821
They wait out the first night as before,

00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.072
but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure.
