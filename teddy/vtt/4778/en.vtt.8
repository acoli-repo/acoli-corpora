00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.839
What any given prisoner doesn't know

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.316
is whether they themselves are one
of the green-eyed people

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.431
the others are keeping track of

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:12.571
until as many nights have passed
as the number of prisoners on the island.

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:17.098
Of course, you could have spared
the prisoners 98 days on the island

00:04:17.098 --> 00:04:21.491
by telling them at least 99 of you
have green eyes,

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:26.251
but when mad dictators are involved,
you're best off with a good headstart.
