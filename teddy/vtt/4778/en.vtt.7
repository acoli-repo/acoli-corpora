The key is the concept 
of common knowledge,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.539
coined by philosopher David Lewis.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.935
The new information was not contained
in your statement itself,

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.953
but in telling it to everyone 
simultaneously.

00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:46.680
Now, besides knowing at least one
of them has green eyes,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.090
each prisoner also knows 
that everyone else is keeping track

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.321
of all the green-eyed people they can see,

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:58.787
and that each of them 
also knows this, and so on.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.839
What any given prisoner doesn't know
