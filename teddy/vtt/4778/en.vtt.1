00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.342
If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.103
As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes,

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:36.676
but they've lived there since birth,

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:41.491
and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color.

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:43.446
There are no reflective surfaces,

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:46.155
all water is in opaque containers,

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:47.663
and most importantly,

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:50.780
they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.754
Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:59.196
Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.607
without absolute certainty of success.
