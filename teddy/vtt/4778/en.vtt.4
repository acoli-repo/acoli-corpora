00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:04.178
Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill.

00:02:04.178 --> 00:02:06.498
Each sees one person with green eyes,

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:09.744
and for all they know, 
that could be the only one.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:12.310
For the first night, each stays put.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.231
But when they see each other 
still there in the morning,

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.641
they gain new information.

00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:22.268
Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him,

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:24.230
he would have left the first night

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.209
after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.321
Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria.
