00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.607
without absolute certainty of success.

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:05.008
After much pressure 
from human rights groups,

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.048
the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.465
and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions:

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:14.549
you may only make one statement,

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.858
and you cannot tell them 
any new information.

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:20.582
What can you say 
to help free the prisoners

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:24.246
without incurring the dictator's wrath?

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.979
After thinking long and hard,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.381
you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes."
