It helped me realize something else during this project,

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:13.199
is that recording that one second on a really bad day

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.432
is extremely difficult.

00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:19.629
It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.053
Or we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.055
But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,

00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:26.936
and something horrible is happening.

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:30.356
And I found that it's actually been very, very important
