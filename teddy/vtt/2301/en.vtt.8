00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:01.553
And it just takes a quick, quick second.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.432
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

00:04:04.432 --> 00:04:07.286
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.779
just driving around the U.S. and Canada

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.018
and just figuring out where to go the next day,

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.623
and it was kind of outstanding.

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:19.335
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip

00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:22.325
for the savings that I had to take my year off,

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:25.219
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.769
with friends working on a really neat project.
