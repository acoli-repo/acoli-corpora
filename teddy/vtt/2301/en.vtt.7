00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.698
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:31.933
They're not even enjoying the show.

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:35.038
They're watching the concert through their cell phone.

00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:39.006
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.824
back in the day, and I've decided that the best way

00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:47.405
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:50.491
and not be that person, is to just record that one second

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.760
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.135
"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:01.553
And it just takes a quick, quick second.
