00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.468
So, I'm an artist.

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.922
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.567
for -- ever since I left school,

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.188
so about seven, eight years now,

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:10.744
and it was draining.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.457
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:16.627
and I found myself never having time for all the projects

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:18.929
that I wanted to work on on my own.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.891
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.122
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.777
and it was called "The power of time off,"

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:27.413
and he spoke about how every seven years,

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:29.520
he takes a year off from work so he could

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.185
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,
