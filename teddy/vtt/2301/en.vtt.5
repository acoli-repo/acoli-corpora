00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:30.265
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:34.463
as the days and weeks and months go by,

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:36.280
time just seems to start blurring

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.202
and blending into each other

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:41.933
and, you know, I hated that,

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:46.962
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:57.881
You know, this project for me is a way for me

00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.175
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.
