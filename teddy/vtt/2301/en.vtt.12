Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:04.125
I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:09.752
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.487
I started a rule of first person perspective.

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:14.560
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.773
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:20.620
The way to really remember what I saw

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.486
was to record it as I actually saw it.
