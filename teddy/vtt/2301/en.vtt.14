Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,

00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:04.757
and this is a really easy thing to do.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.626
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.456
most people in this room, I bet --

00:07:09.456 --> 00:07:11.046
and it's something that's --

00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:13.304
I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,

00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:15.585
and this is my way of doing that,

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.370
and it'd be really interesting also to see,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.340
if you could just type in on a website,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.546
"June 18, 2018,"

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:25.897
and you would just see a stream of people's lives

00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:27.591
on that particular day from all over the world.

00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.813
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,
