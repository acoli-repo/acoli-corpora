00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.175
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.742
Even just this one second allows me to remember

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.019
everything else I did that one day.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.681
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.865
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.578
that I really want to choose,

00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:15.727
but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:17.691
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me

00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:20.171
to remember the other three anyway.

00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.712
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:26.107
against the culture we have now where people

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:28.549
just are at concerts with their cell phones out

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.698
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.
