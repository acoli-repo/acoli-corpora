00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.852
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:08.529
until, you know, I can't record them anymore.

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:10.886
The purpose of this project is, one:

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:15.610
I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.320
There's all these things that I've done with my life

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.234
that I have no recollection of

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.950
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.521
"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.162
And something that I realized early on in the project

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:29.886
was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.365
I would probably forget to record the video.
