00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.641
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.521
and when I worked on this film, I discovered something

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:06.984
about how our brains work, and how our brains work

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:09.263
is that, when we're sort of infused with

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:13.509
either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.917
it changes and alters our perception of things.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.094
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:21.602
And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.522
a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.944
for this particular movie, because I put it out there,

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:31.001
I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment
