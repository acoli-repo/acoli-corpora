00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:10.663
As of 2020, the world’s biggest 
lithium-ion battery

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:13.538
is hooked up to the Southern California 
power grid

00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:18.079
and can provide 250 million watts 
of power,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.996
or enough to power about 250,000 homes.

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:25.788
But it’s actually not the biggest battery
in the world:

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:28.288
these lakes are.

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:32.204
Wait— how can a pair of lakes 
be a battery?
