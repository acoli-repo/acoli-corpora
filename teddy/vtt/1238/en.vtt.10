00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in a way that we couldn't have done

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
just a few years ago.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Another quick example about sensing:

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it's not about people,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but about things we use and consume.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well today, we know everything

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
about where our objects come from.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
This is a map that shows you

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But we know very little about where things go.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So in this project,
