This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me tell you a bit about it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and every boy in Italy grows up

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but the reason I'm showing you this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is that something very interesting

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
over the past couple of decades.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now some time ago,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you take a budget, and you bet your budget

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on a good driver and a good car.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now today, if you want to win the race,
