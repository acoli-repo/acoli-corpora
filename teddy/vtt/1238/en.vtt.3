00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And basically, it's a system made of two components --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a sensing and an actuating component.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What is interesting today

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is that real time control systems

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
are starting to enter into our lives.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Our cities, over the past few years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
just have been blanketed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
with networks, electronics.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They're becoming like computers in open air.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And, as computers in open air,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they're starting to respond in a different way

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,
