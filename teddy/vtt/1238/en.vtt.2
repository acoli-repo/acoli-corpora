Now today, if you want to win the race,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
actually you need also something like this --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
something that monitors the car in real time,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
has a few thousand sensors

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
collecting information from the car,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
transmitting this information into the system,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then processing it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and changing things in real time

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as information is collected.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is what, in engineering terms,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you would call a real time control system.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And basically, it's a system made of two components --
