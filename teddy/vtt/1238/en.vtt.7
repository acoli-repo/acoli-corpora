00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that had been deployed all across the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's a cellphone network --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that's collected anyway by the operator,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in order to understand

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
how the city works.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And anyway, Italy won at the end.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now look at what happened that day

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
just by monitoring activity

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
happening on the network.
