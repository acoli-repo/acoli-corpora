00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but they are 50 percent of the world's population.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Beyond cities,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
all of this sensing and actuating

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is entering our everyday objects.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's from an exhibition that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Paola Antonelli is organizing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
at MoMA later this year, during the summer.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's called "Talk to Me."
