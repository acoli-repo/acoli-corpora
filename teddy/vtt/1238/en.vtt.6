00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and said, shouted,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"PerchÃ© non parli? Why don't you talk?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Well today, for the first time,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
our environment is starting to talk back to us.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'll show just a few examples --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's starting with sensing.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is actually one of the first projects by our lab.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And what we did there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
was actually use a new type of network at the time

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that had been deployed all across the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's a cellphone network --
