00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was growing up in Montana,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I had two dreams.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I wanted to be a paleontologist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a dinosaur paleontologist,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And so that's what I've been striving for

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
all of my life.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was very fortunate

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
early in my career.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was fortunate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in finding things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I wasn't very good at reading things.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In fact, I don't read much of anything.
