00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.016
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.696
found it impossible to abandon the idea
of Martin they had in their heads.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.336
While those I had only just met

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.120
struggled to look past the image
of a silent man in a wheelchair.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.736
I realized that some people
would only listen to me

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.776
if what I said was in line
with what they expected.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.816
Otherwise, it was disregarded

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.496
and they did what they felt was best.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.536
I discovered that true communication

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.376
is about more than merely
physically conveying a message.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.360
It is about getting the message
heard and respected.
