00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.496
I realized that it was in fact
only just the beginning

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.456
of creating a new voice for myself.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.816
I was thrust into a world
I didn't quite know how to function in.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.496

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.696
and as liberating as it often was,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.456
I struggled.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.016
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time
