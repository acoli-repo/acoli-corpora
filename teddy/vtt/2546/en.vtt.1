Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.216
I've thought a lot about it.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.896
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.016
For the first 12 years of my life,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.736
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.896
Then everything changed.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.176

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.016
but they treated me the best they could.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.416
However, I progressively got worse.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.616
Eventually, I lost my ability
to control my movements,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.976
make eye contact,
