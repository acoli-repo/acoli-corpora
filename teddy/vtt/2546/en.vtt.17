And within a year,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.096
I was beginning to use
a computer program to communicate.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.856
It was exhilarating,
but frustrating at times.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.856
I had so many words in my mind,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.696

simply because I could.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.096

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.256

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.296
But as I began to communicate more,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.496
