They were told to take me home
and try to keep me comfortable

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.120
until I died.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.536
My parents, in fact
my entire family's lives,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.856
became consumed by taking care of me
the best they knew how.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.216
Their friends drifted away.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.056
One year turned to two,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.400
two turned to three.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.656
It seemed like the person I once was
began to disappear.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.576
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
I'd loved as a boy were put away.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.056
I had been moved out of my bedroom
into another more practical one.
