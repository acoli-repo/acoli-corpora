00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.536
My personality was entombed
within a seemingly silent body,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.280
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
within a chrysalis.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.656
The stark reality hit me
that I was going to spend

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.336
the rest of my life locked inside myself,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.056
totally alone.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.696
I was trapped with only
my thoughts for company.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.896
I would never be rescued.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.856
No one would ever show me tenderness.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.136
I would never talk to a friend.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.080
No one would ever love me.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.056
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.
