00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.416
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.576
As I learned how the shadows moved
as the hours of the day passed,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.256
I understood how long it would be
before I was picked up and taken home.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.536
Seeing my father walk
through the door to collect me

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.720
was the best moment of the day.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.936
My mind became a tool that I could use

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.776
to either close down
to retreat from my reality

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.776
or enlarge into a gigantic space
that I could fill with fantasies.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.776
I hoped that my reality would change

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.656
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.
