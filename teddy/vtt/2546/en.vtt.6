00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.056
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.576
Well, nothing pleasant.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.936
I lived in fear,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.496
and, to put it bluntly,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.576
was waiting for death
to finally release me,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.496
expecting to die all alone in a care home.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.896
I don't know if it's truly possible
to express in words

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.736
what it's like not to be able
to communicate.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.176
Your personality appears
to vanish into a heavy fog

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.976
and all of your emotions and desires are
constricted, stifled and muted within you.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.496
For me, the worst was the feeling
of utter powerlessness.
