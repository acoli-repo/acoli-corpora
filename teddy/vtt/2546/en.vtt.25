00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.936
A husband, a son, a friend,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.216
a brother, a business owner,
a first-class honors graduate,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.576
a keen amateur photographer.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.440
It is my ability to communicate
that has given me all this.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.016
We are told that actions
speak louder than words.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.976
But I wonder,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200
do they?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.536
Our words, however we communicate them,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.656
are just as powerful.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.416
Whether we speak the words
with our own voices,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.776
type them with our eyes,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.056
or communicate them non-verbally
to someone who speaks them for us,
