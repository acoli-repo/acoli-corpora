00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.256
Hurt, sadness and anger
flooded through me.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.056
I felt worthless.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
There was no one to comfort me.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.336
But neither of my parents
knew this was happening.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.416
I lived in terror, knowing
it would happen again and again.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.536
I just never knew when.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.320
All I knew was that I would
never be the same.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.976
I remember once listening
to Whitney Houston singing,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.856
"No matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity."

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.800
And I thought to myself,
"You want to bet?"
