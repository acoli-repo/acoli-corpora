the fleeting moment of human connection,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.736
transformed how I was feeling,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.680
making me want to keep going.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.696
My existence was tortured by monotony,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.736
a reality that was often too much to bear.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.896

about ants running across the floor.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.416
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.
