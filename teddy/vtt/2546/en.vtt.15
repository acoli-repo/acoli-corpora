00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.656
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.376
But I had been washed away
like a sand castle

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.536
built too close to the waves,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.736
and in my place was the person
people expected me to be.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.536
To some I was Martin,
a vacant shell, the vegetable,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.976
deserving of harsh words,
dismissal and even abuse.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.936

brain-damaged boy

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.176
who had grown to become a man.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.376
Someone they were kind to and cared for.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.896
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas
