00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.256
I also really struggled
to comprehend that I was a man.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.096
The first time someone
referred to me as a man,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.416
it stopped me in my tracks.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.056
I felt like looking around
and asking, "Who, me?"

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.256
That all changed with Joan.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.856
We have an amazing connection

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.536
and I learned how important it is
to communicate openly and honestly.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.496
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
to truly say what I thought.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.816
I started to feel whole again,
a man worthy of love.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.296
I began to reshape my destiny.
