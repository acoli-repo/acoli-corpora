00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.256
Imagine being unable to say,
"I am hungry," "I am in pain,"

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.816
"thank you," or "I love you."

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.936
Being trapped inside your body,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.096
a body that doesn't respond to commands.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.776
Surrounded by people,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.416
yet utterly alone.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.136
Wishing you could reach out,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.376
to connect, to comfort, to participate.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.480
For 13 long years, that was my reality.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.056
Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.
