00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.400
my mother turned to me
and told me that I should die.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.296
I was shocked, but as I thought
about what she had said,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.336
I was filled with enormous compassion
and love for my mother,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.320
yet I could do nothing about it.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.016
There were many moments when I gave up,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.416
sinking into a dark abyss.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.576
I remember one particularly low moment.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.856
My dad left me alone in the car

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.456
while he quickly went
to buy something from the store.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.096
A random stranger walked past,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.960
looked at me and he smiled.
