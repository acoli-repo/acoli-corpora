00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.856
And we owe it to ourselves
to keep this progress going.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.496
We want to say the same thing
10, 20, 30 years from now:

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.600
look what we've done
over the last 30 years.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.936
Yet we know this progress
may not last forever.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.016
In fact, the party's kind of winding down.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.376
It's like "last call for alcohol," right?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.056
If you look under the covers,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.656
by many metrics
like speed and performance,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.200
the progress has already slowed to a halt.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.896
So if we want to keep this party going,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.176
we have to do what we've
always been able to do,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.656
and that is to innovate.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.256
So our group's role
and our group's mission
