At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.296
Let's not go down that same road.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.856
Let's just figure out what's missing.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.296
What are we not dealing with?

Fine, I get it.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.336
Their mother's still alive,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.776
We just said,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.096
"What's the Fredo in our problem?"

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.536
