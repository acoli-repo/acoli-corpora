00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.456
We were never able to translate
that science into new technologies --

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.256
into technologies
that could actually impact people.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.496
And the reason is, these nanomaterials --

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.176
they're like a double-edged sword.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.456
The same thing that makes
them so interesting --

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.776
their small size --

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.096
also makes them impossible to work with.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.856
It's literally like trying to build
a statue out of a pile of dust.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.576
And we just don't have the tools
that are small enough to work with them.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.896
But even if we did,
it wouldn't really matter,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.816
because we couldn't one by one
place millions of particles together

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.200
to build a technology.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.976
So because of that,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.096
all of the promise
and all of the excitement
