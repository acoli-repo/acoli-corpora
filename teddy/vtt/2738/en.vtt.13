00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.096
What are we not doing,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.640
but needs to be done
to make this a success?"

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.256
And the answer is
that the statue has to build itself.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.216
We have to find a way, somehow,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.336
to compel, to convince
billions of these particles

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.336
to assemble themselves
into the technology.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.536
We can't do it for them.
They have to do it for themselves.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.696
And it's the hard way,
and this is not trivial,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.576
but in this case, it's the only way.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.496
Now, as it turns out,
this is not that alien of a problem.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.376
We just don't build anything this way.
