00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.376
And they're at the heart of a field
we call nanotechnology,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.215
which I'm sure we've all heard about,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.696
and we've all heard
how it is going to change everything.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.216
When I was a graduate student,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.576
it was one of the most exciting times
to be working in nanotechnology.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.816
There were scientific breakthroughs
happening all the time.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.256
The conferences were buzzing,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.960
there was tons of money
pouring in from funding agencies.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.016
And the reason is

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.856
when objects get really small,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.496
they're governed by a different set
of physics that govern ordinary objects,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.016
like the ones we interact with.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.976
We call this physics quantum mechanics.
