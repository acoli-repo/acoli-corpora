00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.735
Let's imagine a sculptor
building a statue,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.136
just chipping away with his chisel.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.216
Michelangelo had this elegant way
of describing it when he said,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.136
"Every block of stone
has a statue inside of it,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.256
and it's the task
of the sculptor to discover it."

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.696
But what if he worked
in the opposite direction?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.576
Not from a solid block of stone,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.296
but from a pile of dust,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.696
somehow gluing millions of these particles
together to form a statue.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.216
I know that's an absurd notion.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.976
It's probably impossible.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.936
The only way you get
a statue from a pile of dust
