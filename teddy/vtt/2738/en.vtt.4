00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.776
There were even groups
trying to make an elevator to space

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.040
using carbon nanotubes.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.000
You can look that up, that's true.

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:08.776
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.896
all parts of science and technology,
from computing to medicine.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.176
And I have to admit,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.176
I drank all of the Kool-Aid.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.840
I mean, every last drop.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.320
But that was 15 years ago,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.376
and --

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.776
fantastic science was done,
really important work.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.056
We've learned a lot.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.456
We were never able to translate
that science into new technologies --
