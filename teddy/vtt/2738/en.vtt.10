00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.256
So our group's role
and our group's mission

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.696
is to innovate
by employing carbon nanotubes,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.776
because we think that they can
provide a path to continue this pace.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.256
They are just like they sound.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.736
They're tiny, hollow tubes
of carbon atoms,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.696
and their nanoscale size,
that small size,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.376
gives rise to these
just outstanding electronic properties.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.056
And the science tells us
if we could employ them in computing,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.816
we could see up to a ten times
improvement in performance.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.240
It's like skipping through several
technology generations in just one step.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.096
So there we have it.
