00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.016
so we can use them
to steer these objects around,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.240
much like a tool.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.816
That's exactly what we've done in our lab.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.016
We've developed chemistry
that goes into the pile of dust,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.536
into the pile of nanoparticles,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.936
and pulls out exactly the ones we need.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.576
Then we can use chemistry to arrange
literally billions of these particles

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.456
into the pattern
we need to build circuits.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.816
And because we can do that,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.216
we can build circuits
that are many times faster

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.456
than what anyone's been able
to make using nanomaterials before.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.896
Chemistry's the missing tool,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.536
and every day our tool gets sharper
and gets more precise.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.776
And eventually --
