00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.776
And eventually --

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.416
and we hope this is
within a handful of years --

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.816
we can deliver on one
of those original promises.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.895
Now, computing is just one example.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.456
It's the one that I'm interested in,
that my group is really invested in,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.296
but there are others
in renewable energy, in medicine,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.056
in structural materials,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.136
where the science is going to tell you
to move towards the nano.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.280
That's where the biggest benefit is.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.376
But if we're going to do that,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.576
the scientists of today and tomorrow
are going to need new tools --

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.736
tools just like the ones I described.
