00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.416
would blow this thing away.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.776
You would not be impressed.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.296
It couldn't do anything
that your smartphone does.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.816
It would be slow,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.016
you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.496
you could possibly
get through the first two minutes

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.696
of a "Walking Dead" episode
if you're lucky --

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.736
(Laughter)

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.935
The point is the progress --
it's not gradual.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.656
The progress is relentless.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.935
It's exponential.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.296
It compounds on itself year after year,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.496
to the point where
if you compare a technology

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.216
from one generation to the next,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.216
they're almost unrecognizable.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.856
And we owe it to ourselves
to keep this progress going.
