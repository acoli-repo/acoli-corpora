00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.376
We just don't build anything this way.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.416
People don't build anything this way.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.616
But if you look around --
and there's examples everywhere --

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.536
Mother Nature builds everything this way.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.216
Everything is built from the bottom up.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.496
You can go to the beach,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.696
you'll find these simple organisms
that use proteins --

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.976
basically molecules --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.056
to template what is essentially sand,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.496
just plucking it from the sea

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.896
and building these extraordinary
architectures with extreme diversity.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.536
And nature's not crude like us,
just hacking away.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.256
She's elegant and smart,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.016
building with what's available,
molecule by molecule,
