00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.736
tools just like the ones I described.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.616
And they will need chemistry.
That's the point.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.296
The beauty of science is that
once you develop these new tools,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.576
they're out there.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.856
They're out there forever,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.736
and anyone anywhere
can pick them up and use them,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.720
and help to deliver
on the promise of nanotechnology.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.016
Thank you so much for your time.
I appreciate it.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.480
