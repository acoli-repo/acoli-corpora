00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.096
all of the promise
and all of the excitement

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.896
has remained just that:
promise and excitement.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.296
We don't have any
disease-fighting nanobots,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.376
there's no elevators to space,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.096
and the thing that I'm most interested in,
no new types of computing.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.656
Now that last one,
that's a really important one.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.016
We just have come to expect

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.816
the pace of computing advancements
to go on indefinitely.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.416
We've built entire economies on this idea.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.176
And this pace exists

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.656
because of our ability
to pack more and more devices

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.376
onto a computer chip.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.216
And as those devices get smaller,
