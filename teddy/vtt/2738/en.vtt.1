The only way you get
a statue from a pile of dust

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.296
is if the statue built itself --

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.456
if somehow we could compel millions
of these particles to come together

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.760
to form the statue.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.856
Now, as odd as that sounds,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.016
that is almost exactly the problem
I work on in my lab.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.456
I don't build with stone,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.856
I build with nanomaterials.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.256
They're these just impossibly small,
fascinating little objects.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.576
They're so small that if this controller
was a nanoparticle,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.536
a human hair would be the size
of this entire room.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.376
And they're at the heart of a field
we call nanotechnology,
