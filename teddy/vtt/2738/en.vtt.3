00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.976
We call this physics quantum mechanics.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.176
And what it tells you is
that you can precisely tune their behavior

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.496
just by making seemingly
small changes to them,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.136
like adding or removing
a handful of atoms,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.856
or twisting the material.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.656
It's like this ultimate toolkit.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.776
You really felt empowered;
you felt like you could make anything.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.056
And we were doing it --

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.176
and by we I mean my whole
generation of graduate students.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.696
We were trying to make blazing fast
computers using nanomaterials.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.336
We were constructing quantum dots

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.736
that could one day go in your body
and find and fight disease.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.776
There were even groups
trying to make an elevator to space
