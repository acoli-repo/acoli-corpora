00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.216
And as those devices get smaller,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.496
they get faster, they consume less power

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.936
and they get cheaper.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.536
And it's this convergence
that gives us this incredible pace.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.776
As an example:

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.216
if I took the room-sized computer
that sent three men to the moon and back

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.376
and somehow compressed it --

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.656
compressed the world's
greatest computer of its day,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.256
so it was the same size
as your smartphone --

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.536
your actual smartphone,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.936
that thing you spent 300 bucks on
and just toss out every two years,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.416
would blow this thing away.
