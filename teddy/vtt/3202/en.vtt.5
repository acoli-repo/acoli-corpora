00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:30.608
This is an issue
of international consequence.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.958
Because today, every day,

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:41.379
literally hundreds of thousands of people
are moving into a city somewhere,

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:43.203
mainly in the Global South.

00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.664
And when you think
about that, ask yourself:

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.315
Are they condemned to live
in the same bland cities

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.387
we built in the 20th century,

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.683
or can we offer them something better?

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:57.101
And to answer that question,

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.409
you have to unpack
how we got here in the first place.
