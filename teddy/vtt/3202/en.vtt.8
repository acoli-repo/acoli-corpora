Those have such a wide turning radius,

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.942
that we have to deploy an enormous amount
of pavement, of asphalt,

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.233
to accommodate them.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.633
Or take the critically
important wheelchair.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.172
A wheelchair necessitates
a landscape of minimal slopes

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.887
and redundant vertical circulation.

00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:23.148
So wherever there's a stair,
there has to be an elevator or a ramp.

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:28.697
Now, don't get me wrong, please --
I am all for pedestrian safety,

00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.215
