00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.687
and architects hear this
all the time from their clients:

00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:35.413
"If I try that new idea, will I be sued?

00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:37.418
Will I be mocked?

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:40.545
Better safe than sorry."

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.974
And all of these things
have conspired together

00:06:44.998 --> 00:06:50.897
to blanket our planet with a homogeneity
that I think is deeply problematic.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.525
So how can we do the opposite?

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:55.795
How can we go back to building cities

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.545
that are physically
and culturally varied again?

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.103
How can we build cities of difference?
