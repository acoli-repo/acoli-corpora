you have to unpack
how we got here in the first place.

00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:03.365
First: mass production.

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.310
Just like consumer goods and chain stores,

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:12.887
we mass-produce glass and steel
and concrete and asphalt and drywall,

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.243
and we deploy them in mind-numbingly
similar ways across the planet.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.466
Second: regulation.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.196
So, take cars, for instance.

They're susceptible to human error.

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:32.792
So when we're asked, as architects,
to design a new street,
