00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.379
we built these charming urban buildings,

00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:03.593
these lovely buildings,
all over the world,

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:04.990
from Italy to India.

00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:08.537
And they had maybe
10 or 12 apartments in them.

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:12.243
They had one small elevator
and a staircase that wrapped them

00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:13.417
and a light well.

00:05:13.903 --> 00:05:17.975
And not only were they charming buildings
that were cost-effective,

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.196
they were communal --

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.420
you ran into your neighbor
on that stairwell.

00:05:23.053 --> 00:05:24.820
Well, you can't build this, either.

00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:29.688
By contrast, today, when we have to build
a major new apartment building somewhere,

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.942
we have to build
lots and lots of elevators
