helps you with your fitness when you walk.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.268
Or remember those big ladder fire trucks?

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:08.164
What if we could replace them
and all the asphalt that comes with them

00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:12.188
with drones and robots that could
rescue people from burning buildings?

00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:14.998
And if you think that's outlandish,
you'd be amazed to know

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:18.466
how much of that technology
is already being used today

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.757
in rescue activity.

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:24.370
But now I'd like you
to really imagine with me.

00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:29.154
Imagine if we could design
the hovercraft wheelchair.
