00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.180
And the project is both poetry and prose.

00:10:30.204 --> 00:10:34.061
The poetry is really
about evoking the local:

00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:35.888
the mountainous terrain,

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:39.490
using colors to pick up
the spectacular light,

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:43.366
understanding how to interpret
the nomadic traditions

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.964
that animate the nation of Mongolia.

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:51.180
The prose has been the development
of a catalogue of buildings,

00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:54.093
of small buildings
that are fairly affordable,

00:10:54.117 --> 00:10:57.196
using local construction
materials and technology

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.045
that can still provide
new forms of housing,
