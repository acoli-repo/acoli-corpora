Well, it matters because
most people around the world

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:33.403
are gravitating to urban areas globally.

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:38.561
And how we design those urban areas
could well determine

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.084
whether we thrive or not as a species.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:48.516
So, we already know that people
who live in transit-rich areas,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.121
live in apartment buildings,

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.957
have a far lower carbon footprint

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.941
than their suburban counterparts.

00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:58.410
So maybe one lesson from that
is if you love nature,

00:01:58.434 --> 00:01:59.683
you shouldn't live in it.

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:02.121
