So if you don't want processed food,

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.760

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:36.903
Why would you want these
mass-produced, bleached places

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:39.715
where all of us have to live
and work every day?

00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:46.092

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:51.504
So, technology was a big part
of the problem in the 20th century.

00:07:51.528 --> 00:07:54.077
When we invented the automobile,
what happened is,

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.834
the world all bent towards the invention.

00:07:57.363 --> 00:07:59.751
And we recreated our landscape around it.
