00:09:56.352 --> 00:10:00.045
"We don't have kinetic cobblestones
or flying wheelchairs yet,

00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:03.466
so what can we do about this problem
with today's technology?"

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.712
And my inspiration for that question
comes from a very different city,

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:11.077
the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.264
I have clients there

00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:16.942
who have asked us to design
a 21st-century open-air village

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:21.244
that's sustainably heated
using today's technology,

00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:23.474
in the heart of their downtown.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:26.165
And that's to cope
with their frigid winters.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.180
And the project is both poetry and prose.
