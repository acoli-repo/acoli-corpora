00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.942
we have to build
lots and lots of elevators

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:33.871
and lots of fire stairs,

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:39.361
and we have to connect them with these
long, anonymous, dreary corridors.

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:43.944
Now, developers --
when they're confronted with the cost

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.302
of all of that common infrastructure,

00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:49.443
they have to spread that cost
over more apartments,

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:51.672
so they want to build bigger buildings.

00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:56.387
What that results in is the thud,

00:05:56.411 --> 00:06:01.490
the dull thud of the same
apartment building being built
