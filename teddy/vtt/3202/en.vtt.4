00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:02.121
(Laughter)

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:05.307
But I think the dry statistics

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:07.600
of what's known as
transit-oriented development

00:02:07.624 --> 00:02:09.363
only tells part of the story.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.585
Because cities, if they're
going to attract people,

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:15.853
have to be great.

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:20.617
They have to be powerful magnets
with distinctive appeal

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.061
to bring in all those new green urbanites.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.299
And this is not just
an aesthetic issue, mind you.

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:30.608
This is an issue
of international consequence.
