00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.355
any of the history that I wanted to hear about.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.616
The New York City that I encountered

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.514
felt pretty built up.

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:06.711
I always knew as a kid that I wanted

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.229
to make a difference, and to somehow

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.435
make the world more beautiful, more interesting

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.462
and more just.

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:13.259
I just didn't really know how.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.947
At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:17.366
so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.481
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:23.115
local Kenyan politics than the
politics of my own hometown.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.121
I took a job with the City of New York,

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.270
but very quickly felt frustrated

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.308
with the slowness of government bureaucracy.
