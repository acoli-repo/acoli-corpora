00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:00.932
from Brooklyn to Manhattan,

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:03.701
and it was open between 1908 and 1948,

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.143
just around the time when my grandparents were

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.992
living right in the area.

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:09.640
And we learned also that the site

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.882
was entirely abandoned in 1948.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.805
Fascinated by this discovery,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.933
we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.440
and we finally got a tour,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590
and this is what we saw.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.300
Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960
It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.119
feeling that you have when you get in this space.

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.807
It's a football field of unused land
