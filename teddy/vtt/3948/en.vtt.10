00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.046
underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.760
will introduce a really community-driven focus

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.943
in a rapidly gentrifying area.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:06.687
And right now, we're focusing very closely

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:09.106
on how we engage with the City of New York

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:12.549
on really transforming the overall ecosystem

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.630
in an integrated way.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.239

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.683
So here you see this iconic entrance

00:05:20.683 --> 00:05:22.855
in which we would literally peel up the street

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.870
and reveal the historical layers of the city,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.775
and invite people into this warm underground space.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:31.034
In the middle of winter, when it's
absolutely freezing outside,
