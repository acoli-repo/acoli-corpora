with the slowness of government bureaucracy.

I even took a job at Google,

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:35.110

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.856
and believed almost wholeheartedly

This is the former trolley terminal

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.744
that was the depot for passengers

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:58.648
traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:00.932
from Brooklyn to Manhattan,
