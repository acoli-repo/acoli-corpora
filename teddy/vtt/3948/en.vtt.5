00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.807
It's a football field of unused land

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:35.210
immediately below a very crowded area of the city,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.345
and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.060
on an archaeological dig,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.833
and all the details are all still there.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.801
It's really pretty remarkable.

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.401
Now, the site itself is located at the very heart

00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:47.270
of the Lower East Side,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.766
and today it still remains one of the most

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.757
crowded neighborhoods in the city.

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.557
New York City has two thirds the green space

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:54.605
per resident as other big cities,

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.778
and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.601
So we immediately started thinking about how we

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:01.671
could take this site and turn it into something
