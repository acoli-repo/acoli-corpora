In the middle of winter, when it's
absolutely freezing outside,

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:32.124
the last place you'd want to go would be

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.634
an outdoor space or outdoor park.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.559
The Lowline would really be a four-season space

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.045
and a respite for the city.

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:41.363
So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings

00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:43.984
my own family's story full circle.

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:45.918
If my grandparents and my parents were really

00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:49.205
focused on building the city up and out,

00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:51.281
I think my generation is focused on reclaiming

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.189
the spaces that we already have,

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.146
rediscovering our shared history,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.724
and reimagining how we can make our communities

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.737
more interesting, more beautiful and more just.
