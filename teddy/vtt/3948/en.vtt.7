00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.704
In 2011, we first released some of these images,

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:33.093
and what was funny was,

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.417
a lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.353
like the High Line underground."

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:41.673
And so what our nickname ended up becoming,

00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:43.473
and what ended up sticking,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.319
was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.996
What was also clear was that people really wanted

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:49.694
to know a lot more about how the technology

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:51.260
would look and feel,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.393
and that there was really much more interest in this

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.488
than we had ever thought possible.

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.727
So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job

00:03:57.727 --> 00:03:59.921
and focus entirely on this project.

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.743
