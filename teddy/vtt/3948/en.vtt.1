00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.291
in New York City

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.160
and they encountered a crazy melting pot.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.567
What was amazing about their generation

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.627
was that they were not only building new lives

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.750
in this new, unfamiliar area,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.346
but they were also literally building the city.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:44.479
I've always been fascinated by those decades

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.799
and by that history,

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.278
and I would often beg my grandmother

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:49.947
to tell me as many stories as possible

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:51.955
about the old New York.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.133
But she would often just shrug it off,

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.383
tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:58.260
and so I very rarely got

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.355
any of the history that I wanted to hear about.
