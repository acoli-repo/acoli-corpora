00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:01.671
could take this site and turn it into something

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:03.058
that could be used for the public,

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.810
but also could potentially even be green.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.140
Our plan, in a nutshell,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.841
is to draw natural sunlight underground

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.944
using a simple system that
harvests sunlight above the street,

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:15.380
directs it below the city sidewalks,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.310
and would allow plants and trees to grow

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.999
with the light that's directed underneath.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.730
With this approach, you could take a site

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.941
that looks like this today

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:25.707
and transform it into something

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.673
that looks like this.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.704
In 2011, we first released some of these images,
