WEBVTT

00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.810
and since that time, we've grown

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.111
our numbers of supporters both locally

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.823
and among design enthusiasts all over the world.

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:37.884
Here's a rendering of the neighborhood

00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:40.250
just immediately above the Line's site,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.384
and a rendering of how it will look

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.668
after major redevelopment that is coming

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:46.671
over the course of the next 10 years.

00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.786
Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:50.710
and how there's really a lack of green space.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.430
So what we're proposing is really something that will

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.180
add one football field of green space

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.046
underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly
