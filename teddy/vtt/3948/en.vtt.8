00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.743
Here is us with our team

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.151
putting together a technology demonstration

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.170
in a warehouse.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.270
Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.599
which we built to show the technology.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.479
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.090
And here's the full exhibit all put together

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.541
in this warehouse.

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.318
You can see the solar canopy overhead,

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:21.734
the light streaming in,

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:24.358
and this entirely live green space below.

00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:25.784
So in the course of just a few weeks,

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:29.353
tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,

00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.810
and since that time, we've grown
