their fees to milk the poor.

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:36.569
They will say, "Up to 500 dollars

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.244
if you want to send, we will charge you

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:40.538
30 dollars fixed."

00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:43.634
If you are poor and if you have 
only 200 dollars to send,

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:46.876
you have to pay that $30 fee.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.911
The global average cost of sending

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.448
money is eight percent.

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:52.999
That means you send 100 dollars,

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.672
the family on the other side receives only

00:06:54.672 --> 00:06:56.229
92 dollars.

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.013
To send money to Africa,

00:06:58.013 --> 00:06:59.596
the cost is even higher:

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.942
12 percent.
