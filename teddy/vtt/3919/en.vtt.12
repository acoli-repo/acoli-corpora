00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:00.003
for special occasions like a surgery

00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:03.767
or a wedding. And migrants also send

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:06.707
money, perhaps far too many times,

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:09.103
for unexpected funerals that

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:13.001
they cannot attend.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.679
Much as these flows do all that good,

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.077
there are barriers to these

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:18.987
flows of remittances, these

00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:21.509
400 billion dollars of remittances.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.490
Foremost among them is

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.796
the exorbitant cost of sending money home.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.793
Money transfer companies structure

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:33.567
their fees to milk the poor.
