00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:05.112
I live in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:12.479
but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,
in India.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.973
My father was a government worker.

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:20.859
My mother could not read or write, but she

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.303
would say to me, "A king is 
worshipped only in his

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:32.441
own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."
