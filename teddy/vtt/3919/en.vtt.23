00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.928
the total aid budget of the United States government,

00:11:31.928 --> 00:11:34.784
the largest donor on the planet.

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:36.409
Actually, the savings would be larger

00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:38.532
than that 30 billion because remittance channels

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:43.939
are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:46.410
Another major impediment to the

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.664
flow of remittances reaching the family

00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:51.229
is the large and exorbitant

00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:54.207
and illegal cost of recruitment,

00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:57.145
fees that migrants pay, migrant workers

00:11:57.145 --> 00:12:00.409
pay to laborers who found them the job.
