00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.156
and that dream is as simple as having a

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:03.467
decent job somewhere so they can send money home

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.297
and help the family,

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:09.954
which has helped them before.

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:15.046
There are 232 million international 
migrants in the world.

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:16.395
These are people who live in a country

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:19.051
other than their country of birth.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.760
If there was a country made up of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.369
only international migrants,

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.426
that would be larger, in population,

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:25.863
than Brazil.

00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:27.868
That would be larger, in its size

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:31.070
of the economy, than France.
