00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.942
12 percent.

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:02.916
To send money within Africa,

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:04.400
the cost is even higher:

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.719
over 20 percent.

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.588
For example, sending money from Benin 
to Nigeria.

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:13.840
And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.321
because of exchange controls,

00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.321
you send 100 dollars and you

00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.339
are lucky if the family on the other side

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.749
receives even 10 dollars.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.693
Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela

00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:27.316
through the official channel.

00:07:27.316 --> 00:07:29.440
It all goes in suitcases.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.510
Whereever costs are high,
