All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
also helps cool our cities.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Because, come to think about it,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
do you really want air-conditioning,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or is it a cooler room that you want?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So a few years ago,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
L.A. County

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to repair the city schools.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And Andy and his team discovered

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And by presenting a really strong economic case,
