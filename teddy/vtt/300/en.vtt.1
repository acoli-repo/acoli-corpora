WEBVTT

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we spend, however, on early childhood education,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like Head Start,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we save 17 dollars

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
on stuff like incarceration in the future.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is more than what it costs

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to send one person to Harvard as well.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
took a look at her challenge

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and came up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with a not-so-obvious solution:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
create a business

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that produces skin care products from honey.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation
