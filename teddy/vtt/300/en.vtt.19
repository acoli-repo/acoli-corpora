00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that costs us billions in healthcare

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and lost productivity.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And so we know "urban ag"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is a big buzz topic this time of the year,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
but it's mostly gardening,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
which has some value in community building -- lots of it --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but it's not in terms of creating jobs

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
or for food production.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
The numbers just aren't there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to integrate urban ag and rural food systems

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad
