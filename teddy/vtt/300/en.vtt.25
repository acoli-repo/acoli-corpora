00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
at the same time with the same solution

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
yields great cost savings,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
wealth generation and national security.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Many great and inspiring solutions

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
have been generated across America.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
The challenge for us now

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
is to identify and support countless more.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
but it's not like the old saying,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
"charity begins at home."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And it's about leading in a world

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
