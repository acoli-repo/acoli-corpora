00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of Coal River Mountain Wind

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is her legacy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And she might not

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
get to see that mountaintop.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But rather than writing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
yet some kind of manifesto or something,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
she's leaving behind

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a business plan to make it happen.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's what my homegirl is doing.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So I'm so proud of that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Applause)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But these three people

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
don't know each other,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but they do have an awful lot in common.
