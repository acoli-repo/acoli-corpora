00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you're left with unemployed people,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and those people aren't cheap.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and they include generationally impoverished,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
people coming out of jail.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And for the veterans in particular,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I think that number's probably going to go up.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
They're not the largest number of people,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but they are some of the most expensive --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
poor performance by their kids in schools
