00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And his was gambling,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
compulsively.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
meant that my payday -- or someone else's --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So you need to help him out.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And sometimes I would loan him money

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
from my after-school or summer jobs,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and he always had the great intention

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of paying me back with interest,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
of course, after he hit it big.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And he did sometimes, believe it or not,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
at a racetrack in Los Angeles --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.
