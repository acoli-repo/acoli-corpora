and too much to handle when it rains.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Currently, 20 percent

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of California's energy consumption

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is used to pump water

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
into mostly Southern California.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Their spending loads, loads,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to channel that rainwater out into the ocean

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
when it rains and floods as well.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
L.A. cut infrastructure costs

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
associated with water management and urban heat island --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
linking trees, people and technology

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to create a more livable city.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,
