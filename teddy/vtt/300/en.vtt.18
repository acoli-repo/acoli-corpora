00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but our mayor decided what he wanted to see

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
was a jail on that same spot.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
but after many years,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the city wanted to build a jail.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Working-class and poor urban Americans

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
are not benefiting economically

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
from our current food system.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It relies too much on transportation,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
chemical fertilization, big use of water

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and also refrigeration.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Mega agricultural operations

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,
