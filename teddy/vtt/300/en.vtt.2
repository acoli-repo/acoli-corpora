It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that has real potential.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to care for the bees, harvest the honey

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and make value-added products

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that they marketed themselves,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and that were later sold at Whole Foods.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
She combined employment experience and training

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with life skills they needed,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like anger-management and teamwork,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and also how to talk to future employers

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
about how their experiences

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and their eagerness to learn more.
