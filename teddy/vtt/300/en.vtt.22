00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the impacts of various public health costs.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
for municipalities to handle

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
both infrastructure and social needs.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And we want to shift the systems

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to become part of the tax base.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And imagine a national business model

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to improve local economic stability.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
These examples indicate a trend.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
