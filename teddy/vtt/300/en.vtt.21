00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and economically viable food system.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
for hospitals,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
senior centers, schools, daycare centers,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is smart infrastructure.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And how we manage our built environment

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
affects the health and well-being of people every single day.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Our municipalities, rural and urban,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
play the operational course of infrastructure --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
things like waste disposal, energy demand,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the impacts of various public health costs.
