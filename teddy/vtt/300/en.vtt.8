00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, two dozen men

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
can tear down a mountain in several months,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and only for about a few years' worth of coal.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It can make a mountain go from this to this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in a few short months.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this strange little cough

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
after being only there for just a few hours or so --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
not just miners, but everybody.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and her water poisoned.
