00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and totally understand that this is what it's all about.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But just a few months ago,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Judy was diagnosed

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
with stage-three lung cancer.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Yeah.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And I just find it so bizarre

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that she's suffering from the same thing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that she tried so hard to protect people from.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But her dream

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of Coal River Mountain Wind

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is her legacy.
