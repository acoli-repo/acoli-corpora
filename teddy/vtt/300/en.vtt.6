00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And by presenting a really strong economic case,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
they convinced the L.A. government

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that replacing that asphalt

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
with trees and other greenery,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
was replaced or avoided,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
while employment

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for people to maintain those grounds went up,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
resulting in a net-savings to the system,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
