00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and her water poisoned.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And the coal companies just move on

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
after the mountain was emptied,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
leaving even more unemployment in their wake.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
on an intact mountain,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and one that was reduced in elevation

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
by over 2,000 feet.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or centuries of clean energy

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
based on technical skills,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and developing local knowledge

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
about how to get the most out of that region's wind.
