00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but they do have an awful lot in common.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They're all problem solvers,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and they're just some of the many examples

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in the examples of the work that I do now.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I was really lucky to have them all featured

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
called ThePromisedLand.org.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now they're all very practical visionaries.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They take a look at the demands that are out there --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And when the cheapest solutions

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
involve reducing the number of jobs,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you're left with unemployed people,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and those people aren't cheap.
