00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and their eagerness to learn more.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Less than four percent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of the folks that went through her program

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
actually go back to jail.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So these young men and women learned job-readiness

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and life skills through bee keeping

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and became productive citizens in the process.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Talk about a sweet beginning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and lots of people know

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that L.A. has its issues.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They have not enough water on most days

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and too much to handle when it rains.
