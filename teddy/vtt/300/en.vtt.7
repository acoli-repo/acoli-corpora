00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
resulting in a net-savings to the system,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now Judy Bonds

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is a coal miner's daughter.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Her family has eight generations

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And if anyone should be clinging

to the former glory of the coal mining history,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and of the town,

it should be Judy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But the way coal is mined right now is different

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
from the deep mines that her father

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and her father's father would go down into

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, two dozen men
