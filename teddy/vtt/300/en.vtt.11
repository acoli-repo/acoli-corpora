that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
drug and alcohol abuse,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now Judy and I -- I have to say --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
totally related to each other.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Not quite an obvious alliance.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
or anything like that.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together
