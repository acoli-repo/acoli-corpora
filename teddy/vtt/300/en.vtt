00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So today, I'm going to tell you about some people

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to help ex-convicts reenter society

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and keep them from going back into prison.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Currently, taxpayers spend

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about 60,000 dollars per year

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
sending a person to jail.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we spend, however, on early childhood education,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like Head Start,
