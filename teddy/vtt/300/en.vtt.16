00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
poor performance by their kids in schools

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and also poor health as a result of stress.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So these three guys all understand

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
how to productively channel dollars

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
through our local economies

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to meet existing market demands,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
reduce the social problems that we have now

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and prevent new problems in the future.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And there are plenty of other examples like that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Even when we think or talk about recycling,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they leave much to be recycled.
