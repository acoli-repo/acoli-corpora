00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.375
I love my food.

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:05.181
And I love information.

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:08.496
My children usually tell me

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.958
that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.042
(Laughter)

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.292
But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:18.500
is to take you through how those passions developed,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.860
the point in my life when the two passions merged,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.825
the journey of learning that took place from that point.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:29.621
And one idea I want to leave you with today

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:32.227
is what would would happen differently in your life
