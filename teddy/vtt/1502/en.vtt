00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.462
I read poetry all the time

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:05.022
and write about it frequently

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:06.630
and take poems apart

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.273
to see how they work

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:09.980
because I'm a word person.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.757
I understand the world best, most fully,

00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:15.650
in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.218
and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.368
I'm a little frustrated

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:22.563
until I can try to put it into words.

00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:24.874
I think I've always been that way.

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:27.720
I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000
And I found poems by Andrew Marvell

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.718
and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson
