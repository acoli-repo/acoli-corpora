00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:30.241
you then have a sufficiently
powerful system,

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:32.760
which, if you make it roughly
the size of a city,

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:36.910
it can push a spacecraft,
which is roughly the size of your hand,

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:41.161
to speeds which are roughly
25 percent the speed of light.

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:44.979
That would enable us to get
to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri,

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.450
which is a little over
four light years away,

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.474
in less than 20 years.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.947
Initial probes would be
roughly the size of your hand,

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:55.577
and the size of the reflector
that you're going to use

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:57.490
is going to be roughly human size,

00:01:57.514 --> 00:01:59.529
so not a whole lot larger than myself,

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.466
but a few meters in size.
