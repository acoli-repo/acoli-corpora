00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:03.618
out to about 10 kilometers
or roughly six miles.

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:07.234
We've been able to achieve
synchronization of laser systems,

00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:08.869
and it's worked beautifully.

00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:13.266
We've known how to build lasers
for many decades,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.160
but it's only now that the technology
has gotten inexpensive enough,

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:18.755
and become mature enough

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.649
that we can imagine
having huge arrays, literally,

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:27.299
kilometer-scale arrays,
much like solar farms,

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:31.685
but instead of receiving light,
they transmit light.
