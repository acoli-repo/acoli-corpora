WEBVTT

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.100
would be one of humanity's
foremost explorations,

00:07:30.124 --> 00:07:32.225
and if we're able to do so,

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:34.645
and actually find life on another planet,

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.756
it would change humanity forever.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.304
Everything is profound in life.

00:07:38.328 --> 00:07:39.522
If you look deep enough,

00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:44.427
you'll find something incredibly complex
and interesting and beautiful in life.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:47.566
And the same is true
with the lowly photon

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.970
that we use to see every day.

00:07:51.352 --> 00:07:56.071
But when we look outside
and we imagine something vastly greater,

00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:59.309
an array of lasers that are synchronized,

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:03.472
we could imagine things
which are just extraordinary in life.
