00:06:56.722 --> 00:07:00.117
I think that's probably 30-plus years off
before we get to that point,

00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:01.712
and perhaps more.

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:02.910
But what inspires me

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:06.117
is to look at the ability
to achieve the final goal.

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.649
Even if it does not happen in my lifetime,

00:07:08.673 --> 00:07:11.537
it can happen in the lifetime
of the next generation

00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:12.998
or the generation beyond that.

00:07:13.022 --> 00:07:16.099
The consequences are so transformative

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:19.568
that we literally, in my opinion,
must go down this path,

00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:21.900
and must explore what the limitations are,

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.117
and then how do we overcome
the limitations.

00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:25.895
The search for life on other planets

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.100
would be one of humanity's
foremost explorations,
