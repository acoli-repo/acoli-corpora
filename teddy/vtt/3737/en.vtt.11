00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:31.685
but instead of receiving light,
they transmit light.

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:37.522
The beauty of this type of technology
is it enables many applications,

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:40.490
not just relativistic flight
for small spacecraft,

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:43.172
but enables high-speed spacecraft,

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.601
high-speed flight in our solar system,

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.458
it enables planetary defense,

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:49.950
it enables space debris removal,

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:55.617
it enables powering of distant assets
that we may want to send power to,

00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:59.426
such as spacecraft or bases
on the Moon or other places.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.633
It's an extremely versatile technology,
