00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.466
but a few meters in size.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.561
It only uses the reflection of light
from this very large laser array

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.379
to propel the spacecraft.

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.378
So let's talk about this.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:14.583
This is a lot like sailing on the ocean.

00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:17.822
When you sail on the ocean,
you're pushed by the wind.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.679
And the wind then drives the sail
forward through the water.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:24.398
In our case, we're creating
an artificial wind in space

00:02:24.422 --> 00:02:25.699
from this laser array,

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:29.049
except the wind is actually the photons
from the laser itself,

00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:32.196
the light from the laser becomes the wind
