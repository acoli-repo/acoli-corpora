00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.456
So like art, to me,
science is illuminating.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.877
I want to see reality in a different way.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.410
When I turn on the flashlight,

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.304
suddenly the dark becomes bright,
and I suddenly see.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.963
The flashlight and its light,

00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:40.464
which you can see coming out --

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:43.042
the light on my hand
is not only illuminating my hand,

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.768
it's actually pushing on my hand.

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.101
Light carries energy and momentum.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:50.201
So the answer is not to make a spacecraft
out of a flashlight,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.154
by having the exhaust come out this way

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:53.845
and the spacecraft goes that way --

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.741
that's what we do today with chemistry.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:56.947
The answer is this:

00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:59.515
Take the flashlight and put it
somewhere on the Earth,

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.774
in orbit or on the Moon,
