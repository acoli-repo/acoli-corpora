00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.307
which is dominated by the photonics
of sending data over fiber optics.

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:06.501
Photonics essentially allow
the internet to exist

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:07.799
in the way it does today.

00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.978
The ability to send vast amounts
of data very quickly

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.820
is the same technology
that we're going to use

00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:16.958
to send spacecraft
very quickly to the stars.

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:19.530
You effectively have an infinite
supply of propellent,

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:21.403
you can turn it on and off as needed.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:26.772
You do not leave the laser array
that produces the light on

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:28.201
for the entire journey.

00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:30.757
For small spacecraft,
it's only on for a few minutes,
