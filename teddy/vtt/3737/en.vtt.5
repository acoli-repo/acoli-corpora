00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:32.196
the light from the laser becomes the wind

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.545
upon which we sail.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.100
It is a very directed light --

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:37.248
it's often called directed energy.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:38.702
So why is this possible today,

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:41.268
why can we talk about
going to the stars today,

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.971
when 60 years ago,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.514
when the space program began in earnest,

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:47.728
people would have said,
"That's not possible"?

00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:52.212
Well, the reason it's possible today
has a lot to do with the consumer,

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:54.236
and the very fact that you're watching me.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.855
You're watching me
over a high-speed internet,

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.307
which is dominated by the photonics
of sending data over fiber optics.
