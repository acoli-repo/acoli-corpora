00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:30.757
For small spacecraft,
it's only on for a few minutes,

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:34.299
and then it's like shooting a gun.

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:38.363
You have a projectile
which just moves ballistically.

00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:41.847
Even if we, as humans,
are not on the spacecraft,

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.667
at least we have the ability
to send out such spacecraft.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.320
You want to remotely view,

00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:50.844
or have remote imaging and remote sensing,

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.264
of an object.

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:54.887
So when we go to Jupiter, for example,

00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.950
with a flyby mission,

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:58.609
we are taking pictures of Jupiter,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.316
we're measuring the magnetic field,
