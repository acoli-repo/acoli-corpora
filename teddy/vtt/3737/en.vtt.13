00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:32.704
And we've already started building
prototype systems in our lab.

00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:35.291
So while it's not
going to happen tomorrow,

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:36.871
we've already begun the process,

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:38.990
and so far, it's looking good.

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:42.868
This is both a revolutionary program,

00:06:42.892 --> 00:06:46.177
in terms of being
a transformative technology,

00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:49.137
but it's also an evolutionary program.

00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:52.808
So personally,
I do not expect to be around

00:06:52.832 --> 00:06:56.698
when the first
relativistic flight happens.

00:06:56.722 --> 00:07:00.117
I think that's probably 30-plus years off
before we get to that point,
