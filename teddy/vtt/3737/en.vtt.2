00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.774
in orbit or on the Moon,

00:01:00.798 --> 00:01:02.571
and then shine it on a reflector,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.903
which propels the reflector to speeds
which can approach the speed of light.

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:09.411
Well, how do you make a flashlight
that's big enough?

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.752
This isn't going to do it,

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.855
my hand doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.101
And that's because the force
is very, very low.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.125
So the way that you can solve this problem

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.964
is taking many, many flashlights,
which are actually lasers,

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:21.472
and synchronizing them in time,

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:25.100
and when you gang them all together
into a gigantic array,

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:27.344
which we call a phased array,

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:30.241
you then have a sufficiently
powerful system,
