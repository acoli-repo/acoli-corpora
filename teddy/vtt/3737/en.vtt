00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:03.746
We're here at the University
of California, Santa Barbara

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.357
to discuss a dream of humanity:

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:09.363
the ability to exit our solar system

00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:11.569
and enter another solar system.

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:15.177
And the solution is literally
before your eyes.

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.383
So I have two things on me
that you have -- I have a watch,

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:19.813
and I have a flashlight,

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:22.019
which, if it's not on you,
it's on your phone.

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:23.926
So the watch keeps time,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.195
and my flashlight
just illuminates my environment.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.456
So like art, to me,
science is illuminating.
