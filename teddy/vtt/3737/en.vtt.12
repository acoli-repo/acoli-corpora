It's an extremely versatile technology,

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:04.315
it's something that humanity
would want to develop

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.466
even if they didn't want
to send spacecraft to the stars,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.076
because that technology
allows so many applications

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.601
that are currently not feasible.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.267
And therefore, I feel
it's an inevitable technology,

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.355
because we have the ability,

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.195
we just need to fine-tune the technology

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.426
and in a sense, wait for economics
to catch up with us

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.649
so that it becomes cheap enough
to build the large systems.

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:29.244
The smaller systems are affordable now.

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:32.704
And we've already started building
prototype systems in our lab.
