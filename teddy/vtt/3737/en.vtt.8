WEBVTT

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.316
we're measuring the magnetic field,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.514
the particle density,

00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:03.529
and we're basically exploring remotely.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:05.482
The same way that you are looking at me.

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:08.823
And all of the current missions
that are beyond the Moon

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.887
are remote-sensing missions.

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:13.744
What would we hope to find
if we visited an exoplanet?

00:04:13.768 --> 00:04:16.141
Perhaps there's life on an exoplanet,

00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:18.744
and we would be able to see
evidence of life,

00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:21.029
either through atmospheric biosignatures

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:23.168
or through, you know, a dramatic picture,

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:25.958
we would be able to see something
actually on the surface.

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:28.681
We don't know if there's life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:32.379
Perhaps on the missions that we send out,
we will find evidence for life,
