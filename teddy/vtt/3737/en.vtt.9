00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:32.379
Perhaps on the missions that we send out,
we will find evidence for life,

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:33.855
perhaps we will not.

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.076
And while economics may seem
like an inappropriate thing

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.868
to bring into a talk
on interstellar capability,

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:45.812
it is in fact one of the driving issues
in achieving interstellar capability.

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.620
You have to get things to the point
where they're economically affordable

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:51.914
to do what we want to do.

00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:53.359
So currently,

00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:54.909
we have systems in the lab

00:04:54.933 --> 00:04:59.864
which have achieved the ability
to synchronize over very large scales,

00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:03.618
out to about 10 kilometers
or roughly six miles.
