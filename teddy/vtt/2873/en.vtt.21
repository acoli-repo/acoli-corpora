00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.736
Almost all other materials
have the ability

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.336
to absorb infusions of history and memory,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.680
and project it into the present.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.696
The firm Ennead

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.616
clad the Utah Natural History Museum
in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.840
ores that have been mined
in the area for 150 years

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.520
and that also camouflage the building
against the ochre hills

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.656
so that you have a natural history museum

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.920
that reflects the region's
natural history.
