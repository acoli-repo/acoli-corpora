00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.296
and real life starts to look
like an opera set.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.080
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.600
So just because I'm talking
about the exteriors of buildings,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.520
not form, not function, not structure,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.160
even so those surfaces
give texture to our lives,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.296
because buildings
create the spaces around them,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.336
and those spaces can draw people in

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.560
or push them away.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.976
And the difference often has to do
with the quality of those exteriors.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.736
So one contemporary equivalent
of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca
