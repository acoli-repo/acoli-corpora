00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.496
to give the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.880
that crinkly, sculptural quality.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.416
The architect Stefano Boeri
even created living facades.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.456
This is his Vertical Forest,
a pair of apartment towers in Milan,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.360
whose most visible feature is greenery.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.760
And Boeri is designing a version of this
for Nanjing in China.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.216
And imagine if green facades
were as ubiquitous as glass ones

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.880
how much cleaner the air
in Chinese cities would become.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.296
But the truth is
that these are mostly one-offs,
