00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.736
So one contemporary equivalent
of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.080
is the Place de la Défense in Paris,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.496
a windswept, glass-walled open space

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.296
that office workers hurry through

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.816
on the way from the metro
to their cubicles

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.200
but otherwise spend
as little time in as possible.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.416
In the early 1980s,
the architect Philip Johnson

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.200
tried to recreate a gracious
European plaza in Pittsburgh.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.176
This is PPG Place,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.416
a half acre of open space
encircled by commercial buildings
