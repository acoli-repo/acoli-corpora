00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.776
until SHoP Architects used it
to cover the American Copper Building,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.240
a pair of twisting towers
on the East River.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.416
It's not even finished

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.536
and you can see the way
sunset lights up that metallic facade,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.600
which will weather to green as it ages.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.016
Buildings can be like people.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.360
Their faces broadcast their experience.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.856
And that's an important point,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.920
because when glass ages,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.296
you just replace it,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.216
and the building looks
pretty much the same way it did before

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.936
until eventually it's demolished.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.736
Almost all other materials
have the ability
