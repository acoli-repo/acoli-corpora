00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.760
into hundreds of distinct areas,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.896
balconies and windows and arcades,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.760
each one a separate pocket
of visual activity.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320
That detail and depth, that glamour

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.040
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.400
It becomes a stage
where the generations can meet.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.536
You have teenagers
sprawling on the pavers,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.376
seniors monopolizing the benches,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.296
and real life starts to look
like an opera set.
