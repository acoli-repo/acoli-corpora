00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.536
When we reject granite
and limestone and sandstone

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.736
and wood and copper
and terra-cotta and brick

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.280
and wattle and plaster,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.256
we simplify architecture

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.840
and we impoverish cities.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.576
It's as if you reduced
all of the world's cuisines

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.536
down to airline food.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.616
(Laughter)

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.840
Chicken or pasta?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.760
But worse still,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.336
assemblies of glass towers
like this one in Moscow

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.256
suggest a disdain for the civic
and communal aspects of urban living.
