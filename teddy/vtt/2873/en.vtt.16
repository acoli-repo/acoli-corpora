00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.136
Those 2,000-year-old carvings

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.200
make it clear that this was a place
of high ritual significance.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.016
Today we look at those and we can see
a historical and textural continuity

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.896
between those carvings,
the mountains all around

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.776
and that church which is built
on top of the ruins

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.960
using stone plundered from the site.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.776
In nearby Oaxaca,
even ordinary plaster buildings

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.136
become canvasses for
bright colors, political murals

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.000
and sophisticated graphic arts.
