00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.696
largely through some
really spectacular office buildings

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.680
like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,
designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.256
Eventually, the technology
advanced to the point

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.376
where architects could design
structures so transparent

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.686
they practically disappear.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.776
And along the way,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.840
glass became the default material
of the high-rise city,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.176
and there's a very
powerful reason for that.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.920
Because as the world's populations
converge on cities,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.656
the least fortunate pack
into jerry-built shantytowns.
