00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.680
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.856
These are just ordinary residences

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.440
expressing the ordinary
splendor of cities.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.776
And the reason they're like that
is that the need for shelter

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.880
is so bound up with
the human desire for beauty.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.320
Their rough surfaces
give us a touchable city.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.416
Right? Streets that you can read

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.560
by running your fingers
over brick and stone.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.280
But that's getting harder to do,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440
because cities are becoming smooth.
