00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.416
Imagine that when you walked
in here this evening,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.520
you discovered that everybody in the room
looked almost exactly the same:

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.216
ageless, raceless,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.480
generically good-looking.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.256
That person sitting right next to you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.416
might have the most
idiosyncratic inner life,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.696
but you don't have a clue

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.280
because we're all wearing
the same blank expression all the time.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.320
That is the kind of creepy transformation
that is taking over cities,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.960
only it applies to buildings, not people.
