00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.680
It's just not the sort of place
you really want to just hang out and chat.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.216
Public spaces thrive or fail
for many different reasons.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.640
Architecture is only one,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.880
but it's an important one.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.176
Some recent plazas

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.560
like Federation Square in Melbourne

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.080
or Superkilen in Copenhagen

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.336
succeed because they combine old and new,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560
rough and smooth,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.256
neutral and bright colors,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.920
and because they don't rely
excessively on glass.
