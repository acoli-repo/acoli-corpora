00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.776
We tend to think of a facade
as being like makeup,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.562
a decorative layer applied at the end
to a building that's effectively complete.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.696
But just because a facade is superficial

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.976
doesn't mean it's not also deep.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.280
Let me give you an example

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.216
of how a city's surfaces
affect the way we live in it.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.136
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.416
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.856
at all hours of the day.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.856
Early in the morning,
sunlight rakes the facades,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.576
sharpening shadows,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.896
and at night, lamplight
segments the buildings

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.760
into hundreds of distinct areas,
