00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440
because cities are becoming smooth.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.736
New downtowns sprout towers

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.096
that are almost always
made of concrete and steel

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.480
and covered in glass.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.776
You can look at skylines
all over the world --

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.000
Houston,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.840
Guangzhou,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.640
Frankfurt --

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.856
and you see the same army
of high-gloss robots

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160
marching over the horizon.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.696
Now, just think of everything we lose

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.960
when architects stop using
the full range of available materials.
