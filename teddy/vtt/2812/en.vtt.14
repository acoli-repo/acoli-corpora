I would say that's an outer-truth claim,

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.442
because he physically rose or he didn't.

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:12.192

00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:27.951
and I'm not going to try
to persuade you of it,"

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.530
now you've moved it
from outer truth to inner truth,
