00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:02.863
we're saying, OK, I respect you,
I'm listening to what you're saying,

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:04.879
I'm going to test it out with you.

00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:08.258
We've all had that experience
where you're telling someone something,

00:11:08.282 --> 00:11:11.013
and they're like, "Oh,
that's really interesting, yeah,"

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.160
you know you're being had.

00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:16.474
But when someone says, "Really? Huh.

00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.983
Sounds a little sketchy to me,
but I'm listening,"

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:22.664
you at least know
you're being engaged and respected.

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:25.804
And that's the kind of attitude
we should have with these claims.

00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:28.535
That's showing someone
that you care what they're saying.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:31.495
That's respect.
