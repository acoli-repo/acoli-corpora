00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:32.462
and it's taken me a while to get
to this place, but I think this is right,

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:33.750
so hear me out.

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:36.929
I think there is outer truth
and there's inner truth.

00:06:36.953 --> 00:06:40.168
So if you say to me,

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:42.865
"There was a man named Jesus
and he once existed,"

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.586
that's outer truth, right?

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.960
And we can go and look
at the historical record.

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:49.395
We can determine
whether that seems to be true.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.958
And I would argue,
it does seem to be true.

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:57.653
If you say, "Jesus rose
from the dead," -- ooh, trickier.

00:06:57.677 --> 00:06:59.904
