00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:31.495
That's respect.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.909
Now, yes, most of these searches
will come up empty,

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:40.766
but that's how all of science works.

00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:45.264
Every cure for cancer so far
has not panned out,

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.620
but we don't stop looking,

00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:49.174
for two reasons.

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.676
Because number one, the answer matters.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.722
Whether it's looking at the afterlife
or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,

00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:58.079
it all amounts to the same question:

00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:00.782
How long will we be here?
