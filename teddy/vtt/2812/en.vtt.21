Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
but I hope I never lose this hope,

00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:37.782
and I invite you to take
this same attitude

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.249
when people share
their outer beliefs with you.

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.740
When talking about testable claims,

00:10:42.764 --> 00:10:46.443
respect them enough to ask
these good questions.

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:49.329
Challenge and see
how you can examine them together,

00:10:49.353 --> 00:10:53.522
because there's this idea
that you can't respect a belief

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:56.096
and still challenge it,
but that's not true.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.867
When we jiggle the lock,
when we test the claim,

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:02.863
we're saying, OK, I respect you,
I'm listening to what you're saying,
