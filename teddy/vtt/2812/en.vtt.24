00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:00.782
How long will we be here?

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:05.749
And two, because looking for the truth,

00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:07.082
being open-minded,

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:11.475
and being willing to be wrong
and to change your whole worldview

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:13.547
is awe-inspiring.

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:18.131
I still get excited at ghost stories
every single time.

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:21.239
I still consider that every group
I join might be right,

00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:23.260
and I hope I never lose that hope.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.088
Let's all never lose that hope,

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.967
because searching for what's out there

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:29.905
helps us understand what's in here.
