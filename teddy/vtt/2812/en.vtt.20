00:09:54.975 --> 00:10:00.285
that maybe before seemed like
otherworldly explanations,

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:05.369
help draw us into reality
and maybe change our lives for the better.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:12.265
Now, on the other hand,
maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.

00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:14.911
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,

00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:17.108
and holy shit, it will be the best thing!

00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:19.856
And every time I do
one of these investigations,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.686
I still get so excited,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.773
and I'm like 75 into them,

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:27.874
and still I swear on number 76,
I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"

00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:29.103
(Laughter)

00:10:29.127 --> 00:10:33.983
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
but I hope I never lose this hope,
