to anyone who can show,
under scientific conditions,

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:36.139
that they have a paranormal ability.

00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:37.869
No one's done it yet,

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:42.951
but they've had a couple people
who claim that they were clairaudients,

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:47.031
which means that they can hear voices
either from the great beyond

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:48.953
or they can read minds.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:51.737
And they had one person
who was very sincere,

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.652
who believed that he could read minds.

00:08:54.745 --> 00:09:00.732
So they set up a test with him,
and this is the way it always works.
