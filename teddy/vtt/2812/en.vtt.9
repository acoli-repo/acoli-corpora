00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:30.062
I said, "I have an emergency.
I need you to come out.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.356
I don't want to get into the story now,
but I need you to come out."

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.573
(Laughter)

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:37.384
They came out. I said,
"I suspect a gas leak."

00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:39.924
They brought their carbon
monoxide detector,

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:41.990
and the man said,

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:45.477
"It's a really good thing
that you called us tonight,

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:47.914
because you could have been
dead very soon."

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:55.034
Thirty-seven percent of Americans
believe in haunted houses,

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:59.648
and I wonder how many of them
have been in one

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:02.664
and how many of them have been in danger.
