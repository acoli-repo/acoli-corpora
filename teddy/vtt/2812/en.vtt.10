00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.438
I'm an investigator, and I'm
an investigator in two senses:

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.030
I'm an investigative journalist,

00:05:14.054 --> 00:05:17.240
and I'm also an investigator
of the claims of the paranormal

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:19.260
and claims of the spiritual.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:20.792
And that means a few things.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:24.767
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending
to need an exorcism

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.356
so I can get -- yes, that's right! --
so I can go to an exorcist

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.986
and see if he's using gimmicks
or psychological tricks
