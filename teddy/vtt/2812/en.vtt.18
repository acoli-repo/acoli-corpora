00:08:54.745 --> 00:09:00.732
So they set up a test with him,
and this is the way it always works.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.002
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol,

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:05.041
we have a way to scientifically test this.

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:06.218
Do you agree with it?"

00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:08.138
The person says yes. Then they test it.

00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:10.167
It's very important that both sides agree.

00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:12.606
They did that, they tested him.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.184
They said, "OK, you know what?

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:19.050
You weren't able to predict
what Lisa was thinking.

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:21.103
It matched up about the same as chance.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.969
Looks like you don't have the power."

00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:24.843
And that gave them the opportunity

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:30.136
to compassionately sit down with him
and have a very difficult discussion,
