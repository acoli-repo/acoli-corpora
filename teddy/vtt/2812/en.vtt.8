00:03:57.363 --> 00:04:00.710
Like, gas poisoning?"

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.713
Carbon monoxide poisoning
is when you have a gas leak

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:05.180
leaking into your home.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:11.032
I looked it up, and the symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.186
include a pressure on your chest,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.608
auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.410
and an unexplained feeling of dread.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.233
So that night, I called the gas company.

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:30.062
I said, "I have an emergency.
I need you to come out.
