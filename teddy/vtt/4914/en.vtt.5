00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:30.312
But when the salmon head 
towards shore in droves to spawn,

00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:32.612
the killer whales follow.

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.752
The matriarch shows the younger whales

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.882
where to find the most fertile 
fishing grounds.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:42.772
She also shares up to 90% of 
the salmon she catches.

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:44.242
With each passing year,

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.792
her contributions become more vital:

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:51.872
overfishing and habitat destruction have 
decimated salmon populations,

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:56.152
putting the whales at near-constant 
risk of starvation.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.006
These grandmothers’ expertise

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.906
can mean the difference between 
life and death for their families–
