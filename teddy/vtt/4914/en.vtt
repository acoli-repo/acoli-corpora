Off the rugged coast 
of the pacific northwest,

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:17.318
pods of killer whales 
inhabit the frigid waters.

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.538
Each family is able to survive here

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:21.578
thanks mainly to one member,

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:23.598
its most knowledgeable hunter:

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.208
the grandmother.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.418
These matriarchs can live eighty years 
or more,

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:31.508
while most males die off 
in their thirties.
