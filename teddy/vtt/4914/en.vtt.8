00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.581
An older female can further her genes
without burdening her family

00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.761
by supporting her adult sons,

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.801
who sire calves other families will raise.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:10.231
This might be why the females have evolved

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:14.321
to stop reproducing entirely 
in middle age.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.802
Even with the grandmothers’ contributions,

00:04:16.802 --> 00:04:20.202
the Southern Resident killer whales 
are critically endangered,

00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:23.052
largely due to a decline in salmon.

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:26.562
We urgently need to invest in restoring 
salmon populations

00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:28.442
to save them from extinction.

00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:32.742
In the long term, we’ll need more studies 
like the Center for Whale Research’s.
