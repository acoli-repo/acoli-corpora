00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.926
This means that as a female 
killer whale ages,

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:33.886
a greater percentage of her family

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.596
consists of her children 
and grandchildren,

00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:39.416
while more distant relatives die off.

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:44.126
Because older females are more closely 
related to the group than younger females,

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:47.511
they do best to invest in the family 
as a whole,

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:51.231
whereas younger females should 
invest in reproducing.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.911
In the killer whale’s environment,

00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:55.591
every new calf is another mouth to feed

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.301
on limited, shared resources.

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.581
An older female can further her genes
without burdening her family
