00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.906
can mean the difference between 
life and death for their families–

00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:04.196
but why do they stop having calves?

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:08.656
It’s almost always advantageous for a
female to continue reproducing,

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:12.786
even if she also cares for her existing 
children and grandchildren.

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:17.406
A couple unique circumstances 
change this equation for killer whales.

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:20.416
The fact that neither sons or daughters

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:23.636
leave their families of origin 
is extremely rare—

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.036
in almost all animal species,

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:28.786
one or both sexes disperse.

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.926
This means that as a female 
killer whale ages,
