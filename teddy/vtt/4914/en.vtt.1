00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:31.508
while most males die off 
in their thirties.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:34.608
Though killer whales inhabit 
every major ocean,

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:37.658
until recently we knew 
very little about them.

00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:40.518
The details of their lives 
eluded scientists

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:44.028
until an organization called 
the Center for Whale Research

00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:46.608
began studying a single population

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:51.378
near Washington State and 
British Columbia in 1976.

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:52.978
Thanks to their ongoing work,

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:55.368
we’ve learned a great deal 
about these whales,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:57.768
known as the Southern Residents.

00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:59.008
And the more we learn,

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:04.388
the more this population’s elders’ 
vital role comes into focus.
