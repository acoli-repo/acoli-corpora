00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:32.742
In the long term, we’ll need more studies 
like the Center for Whale Research’s.

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:34.982
What we’ve learned about 
the Southern Residents

00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:37.172
may not hold true for other groups.

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:39.612
By studying other populations closely,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.602
we might uncover more 
startling adaptations,

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:46.156
and anticipate their vulnerabilities 
to human interference

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:49.306
before their survival is at risk.
