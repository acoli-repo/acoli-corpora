And so next time your neighbor sees you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And you can let them social network with your tadpole,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site

and other related things.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
