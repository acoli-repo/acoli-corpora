00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is redefine what counts as health.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except people come to the clinic

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with environmental health concerns,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and they walk out with prescriptions

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for things they can do to improve environmental health,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But that suggests the issue

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that I'm trying to get at here,
