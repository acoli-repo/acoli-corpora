00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in a sample of water in which they're interested.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we give them a couple of things to do that,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to help them do companion animal devices

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
while they're blogging and doing their email.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This is a tadpole walker

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to take your tadpole walking in the evening.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the interesting thing that happens --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because we're using tadpoles, of course,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
several orders of magnitude more sensitive

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
than some of our senses

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
for sensing,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
responding in a biologically meaningful way,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to that whole class of industrial contaminants

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we call endocrine disruptors
