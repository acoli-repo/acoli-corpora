00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to that whole class of industrial contaminants

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we call endocrine disruptors

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or hormone emulators.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
there's a few action shots --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And then you have to introduce your tadpole

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and who it's named after.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You have to explain what you're doing

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and how the developmental events of a tadpole

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are, of course, very observable

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And so next time your neighbor sees you
