WEBVTT

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to create an engineered micro landscape,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to create an infiltration opportunity.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Because, many of you will know,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that the biggest pollution burden

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is no longer the point sources,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
no longer the big polluters,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
no longer the GEs,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but that massive network of roads,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[those] impervious surfaces,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or the oily hydrocarbon waste

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
washes it straight into the estuary system.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
That doesn't do a lot of good.
