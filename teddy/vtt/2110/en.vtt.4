00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that medicos were trained to deal with;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
this is a different definition of health,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
health that has a great advantage

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because it's external, it's shared,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we can do something about it,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or individualized.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but impatients,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to address local and environmental health issues.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that I set up in various places
