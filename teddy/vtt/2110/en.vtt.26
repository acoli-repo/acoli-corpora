00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but through the animals

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
with whom we cohabit.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
In fact, urban migration now describes

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the movement of animals formerly known as wild

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
into urban centers.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
elk in Westchester County.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's happening all over the Developed World,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
probably for loss of habitat,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but also because our cities are a little bit more livable

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
than they have been.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And every green space we create

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But we've kind of lacked imagination

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
in how we could do that well or interestingly.
