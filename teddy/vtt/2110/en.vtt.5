WEBVTT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that I set up in various places

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that provide an immersion

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in some of the environmental challenges we face.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I like this one from the Belgian field office,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
where we met in a roundabout,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
precisely because the roundabout iconified

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the headless social movement

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that informs much social transformation,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
as opposed to the top-down control

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of red light traffic intersections.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In this case, of course, the roundabout

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with that micro-decisions being made in situ

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by people not being told what to do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But, of course, affords greater throughput,
