00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
instead of monopolizing them.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That is, share your lunch.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Laughter)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
NJ: It worked, and it's true.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The final project I'd like to show you

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
is a new interface for fish

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that has just been launched --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it's actually officially launched next week --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
but there is now a device for you to do so.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
project three foot up, three foot down.
