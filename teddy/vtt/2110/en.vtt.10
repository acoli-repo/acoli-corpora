00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
observing the behavioral

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and developmental events,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you will then go and introduce your tadpole

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to its namesake

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and discuss the evidence that you've seen.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
instead of asking you for urine samples,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I'll ask you for a mouse sample.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a domestic partnership with mice?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Very lucky.
