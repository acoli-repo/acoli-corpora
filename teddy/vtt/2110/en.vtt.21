00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And they still remain

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
as icons of civic response

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I would say, looks something like this, or this,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which is an intensive urban agriculture facility

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
What it does

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
is a very simple idea

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of taking --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
is building related --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we take the CO2 from the building --
