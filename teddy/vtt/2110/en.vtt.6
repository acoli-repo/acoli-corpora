00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by people not being told what to do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But, of course, affords greater throughput,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
fewer accidents,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and an interesting model of social movement.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or keeping tabs, if you will.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What they are is an addition of tadpoles

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that are named after a local bureaucrat

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
whose decisions affect your water quality.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So an impatient concerned for water quality

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
would raise a tadpole bureaucrat

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in a sample of water in which they're interested.
