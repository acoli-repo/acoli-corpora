00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then I swap it out

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
with the students

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and actually re-release that carbon black.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that we've pulled out of the air.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Here's one of them that we have up now.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Okay, so I want to show you

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
just two more interfaces,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
because I think one of our big challenges

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
not only through this model

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
of twisted personalized health,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but through the animals
