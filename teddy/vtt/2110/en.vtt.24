00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
because it changes, it settles on the snow,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it changes the reflectors,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
it changes

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Carbon black is that grime

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and it's associated with.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
not from combustion itself.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
When we put it through our solar chimney,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
we remove actually about 95 percent of that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then I swap it out

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
with the students
