00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But that suggests the issue

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that I'm trying to get at here,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because this idea that health is internal

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and atomized and individual

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and pharmaceutical

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is largely an error.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I would use this study,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a recent study by Philip Landrigan,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to motivate a different view of health,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the New York area

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and logged what they spent their patient hours on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
80 to 90 percent of their time

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
was spent on five things.
