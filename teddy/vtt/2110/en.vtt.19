00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
these smaller interceptions

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that now runs into the estuary system,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So these are small actions

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that can amount to a significant effect

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to improve local environmental health.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
This is one of the more ambitious ones.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What the climate crisis has revealed to us

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is a secondary, more insidious

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and more pervasive crisis,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which is the crisis of agency,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
which is what to do.
