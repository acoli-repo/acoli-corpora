00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Very lucky.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Mice, of course, are the quintessential

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
model organism.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
They're even better models of environmental health,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because not only the same mammalian biology,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but they share your diet, largely.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They share your environmental stressors,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the asbestos levels and lead levels,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
whatever you're exposed to.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And they're geographically more limited than you are,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
because we don't know if you've been exposed

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to persistent organic pollutants

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
in your home, or occupationally

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
or as a child.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Mice are a very good representation.
