00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the benefits are enjoyed by anyone

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
you share that water quality or air quality with.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And that aggregating effect,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that collective action effect,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is actually something we can use to our advantage.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
called the No Park.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is a prescription to improve water quality.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
What we do is we take a fire hydrant,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to create an engineered micro landscape,
