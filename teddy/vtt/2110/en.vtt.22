00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we take the CO2 from the building --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
CO2-enriched air --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
we force it through the urban agriculture facility,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So it's on legs,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It's built as a barn raising,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
using open source hardware.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
This is the quarter-scale prototype

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that was functioning in Spain.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
NYU willing.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And what I want to show you is --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --
