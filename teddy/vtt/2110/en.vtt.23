00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And what I want to show you is --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
which is a solar chimney --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that passively draws air up.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You understand a solar chimney.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Hot air rises.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What we do is actually

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That actually removes about 95 percent

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
of the carbon black,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that stuff that, with ozone,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,
