00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
from the people below --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
about a hundred to one

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
of the avian flu

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
becoming a deadly human flu.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Healthy sub-populations of birds,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
happy, well-fed.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources
