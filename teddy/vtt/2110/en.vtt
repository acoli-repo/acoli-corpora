00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was informed by this kind of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
unoriginal and trite idea

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that new technologies were an opportunity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for social transformation,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is what drove me then,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it's still the same theme song --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and introduce you to my lab and current work,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is the Environmental Health Clinic

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I run at NYU.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is redefine what counts as health.
