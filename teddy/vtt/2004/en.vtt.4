Well, in Africa, we have
the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.160
crashing every day.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.615
But perhaps if we can attract
these mosquitoes to traps,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.216
bait it with our smell,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.160
we may be able
to stop transmission of disease.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.576
Now, solving this puzzle
was not an easy thing,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.576
because we produce hundreds
of different chemicals on the skin,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.256
but we undertook
some remarkable experiments

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.576
that managed us to resolve
this puzzle very quickly indeed.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.936
First, we observed
that not all mosquito species
