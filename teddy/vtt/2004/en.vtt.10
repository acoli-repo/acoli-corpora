They can't fly.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.136
And they're accessible.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.200
You can actually walk up to that pool
and you can kill them there, right?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.736
So the problem that we face with this

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.656
is that, throughout the landscape,
all these pools of water with the larvae,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.656
they are scattered all over the place,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.896
which makes it very hard
for an inspector like this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.480
to actually find all these breeding sites
and treat them with insecticides.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.240
And last year we thought very, very hard,
how can we resolve this problem?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.416
Until we realized that just like us --
we have a unique smell --
