00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320
And there's a whole range
of compounds that they do use.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.800
And this was not going to be an easy task.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.640
And therefore we set up
various experiments.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.816
Why did we set up these experiments?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.136
Because half the world's population

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.456
runs the risk of contracting
a killer disease like malaria

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.040
through a simple mosquito bite.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.256
Every 30 seconds,
somewhere on this planet,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.736
a child dies of malaria,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.656
and Paul Levy this morning,
he was talking about the metaphor

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.176
of the 727 crashing
into the United States.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.856
Well, in Africa, we have
the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s
