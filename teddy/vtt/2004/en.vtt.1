00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.000
and suck out your blood?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.720
That's awful, right?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
In fact, there's only one good thing
I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.920
When they fly into our bedroom at night,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.134
they prefer to bite my wife.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.816
(Laughter)

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.296
But that's fascinating, right?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760
Why does she receive more bites than I do?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.016
And the answer is smell,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.240
the smell of her body.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.976
And since we all smell different
and produce chemicals on our skin

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.936
that either attract or repel mosquitoes,
