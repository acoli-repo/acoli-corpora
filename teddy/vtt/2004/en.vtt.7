that said that cheese smells after feet

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.240
rather than the reverse.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.296
Think of it.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.749
And this triggered us
to do a remarkable experiment.

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:41.816
We tried, with a tiny little piece
of Limburger cheese,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600
which smells badly after feet,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.376
to attract African malaria mosquitoes.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.280
And you know what? It worked.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.416
In fact, it worked so well

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.976
that now we have a synthetic mixture
of the aroma of Limburger cheese

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.776
that we're using in Tanzania

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.016
and has been shown there
