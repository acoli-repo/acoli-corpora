00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.320
And I will show you how we can use dogs
in the fight against malaria.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.736
One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.056
is not to wait until
they fly around like adults

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.960
and bite people and transmit disease.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.200
It's to kill them when they're still
in the water as larvae.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.136
Why?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520
Because they are just like the CIA.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.456
In that pool of water,
these larvae are concentrated.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.136
They're all together there.
They are immobile.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.816
They can't escape from that water.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.416
They can't fly.
