He's going back to check
the control holes again,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.456
but he's coming back to the first one,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.296
and now he's locking into that smell,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.936
which means that now,
we can use dogs with these inspectors

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.176
to much better find the breeding sites
of mosquitoes in the field,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.600
and therefore have
a much bigger impact on malaria.

This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.199
She's one of the best
dog trainers in the world,

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:21.263
and she believes
that we can do a lot more.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.616
Since we also know that people
that carry malaria parasites

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.496
smell different compared to people
that are uninfected,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.920
she's convinced that we can train dogs
to find people that carry the parasite.
