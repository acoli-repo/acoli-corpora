00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.936
First, we observed
that not all mosquito species

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
bite on the same part of the body.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.816
Strange.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.416
So we set up an experiment

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.797
where we put a naked volunteer
in a large cage,

00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:40.836
(Laughter)

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.296
and in that cage, we released mosquitoes

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.000
to see where they were biting
on the body of that person.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560
And we found some remarkable differences.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.016
On the left here you see the bites

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.296
by the Dutch malaria mosquito
on this person.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.000
They had a very strong preference
for biting on the face.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.336
In contrast, the African malaria mosquito
