Until we realized that just like us --
we have a unique smell --

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.720
mosquito larvae
also have a very unique smell.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.656
And so we set up another crazy experiment,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.016
because we collected
the smell of these larvae,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.320
put it on pieces of cloth,
and then did something very remarkable.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.376
Here we have a bar with four holes

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.176
and we put the smell
of these larvae in the left hole.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.416
Oh, that was very quick.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.576
And then you see the dog.
It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.216
He's examining these holes
and now he's got it already.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.576
He's going back to check
the control holes again,
