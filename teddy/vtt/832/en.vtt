00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in the 21st century.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is to go back to our school days

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when we learned how to count.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because what we actually count

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
truly counts.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me start by telling you a little story.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is Van Quach.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
She changed her name to Vivian
