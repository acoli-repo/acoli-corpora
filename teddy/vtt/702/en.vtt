00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.548
What I'm going to show you first,
as quickly as I can,

00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:06.341
is some foundational work,
some new technology

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.976
that we brought to Microsoft
as part of an acquisition

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.821
almost exactly a year ago.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.213
This is Seadragon, and it's an environment

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:15.713
in which you can either
locally or remotely interact

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:17.856
with vast amounts of visual data.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:21.569
We're looking at many, many gigabytes
of digital photos here

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:24.508
and kind of seamlessly
and continuously zooming in,

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:27.077
panning through it,
rearranging it in any way we want.

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.976
And it doesn't matter how much
information we're looking at,
