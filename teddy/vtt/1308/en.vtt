00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
90 percent of my photographic process

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is, in fact, not photographic.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It involves a campaign of letter writing,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
research and phone calls

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to access my subjects,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to a hibernating black bear in its cave

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in West Virginia.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And oddly, the most notable

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
letter of rejection I ever received

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
came from Walt Disney World,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a seemingly innocuous site.
