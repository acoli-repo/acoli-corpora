00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.396
Now, this is Joanna.

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:05.956
Joanna works at a university in Poland.

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.916
And one Saturday morning at 3am,

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:11.276
she got up, packed her rucksack

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.036
and traveled more than
a thousand kilometers,

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.516
only to have a political argument

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.276
with a stranger.

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:22.996
His name is Christof,
and he's a customer manager from Germany.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.596
And the two had never met before.

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:29.316
They only knew that they were
totally at odds over European politics,

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:32.756
over migration, or the relationship
to Russia or whatever.
