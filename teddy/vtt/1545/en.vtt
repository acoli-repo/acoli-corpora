00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was this very implausible technology

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that technically could have worked,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This was a perfect introduction.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it's a story that did work. It did happen,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the machines are all around us.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And it was a technology that was inevitable.
