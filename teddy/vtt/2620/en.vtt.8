This is what you call
physical entrainment.

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.725
Now let's go back to the brain and ask:

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.893
What's driving this neural entrainment?

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.702
Is it simply the sounds
that the speaker is producing?

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:09.049
Or maybe it's the words.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.719
Or maybe it's the meaning
that the speaker is trying to convey.

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:15.503
So to test it, we did
the following experiment.

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:18.728
First, we took the story
and played it backwards.

00:04:18.752 --> 00:04:21.878
And that preserved many
of the original auditory features,

00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:23.915
but removed the meaning.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.610
And it sounds something like that.

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:30.772
