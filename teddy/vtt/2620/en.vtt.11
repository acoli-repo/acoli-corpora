00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:34.895
However, only when we use
the full, engaging, coherent story

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.144
do the responses spread
deeper into the brain

00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:38.699
into higher-order areas,

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:41.824
which include the frontal cortex
and the parietal cortex,

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:44.436
and make all of them
respond very similarly.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.729
And we believe that these responses
in higher-order areas are induced

00:05:47.753 --> 00:05:49.879
or become similar across listeners

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:52.643
because of the meaning
conveyed by the speaker,

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.268
and not by words or sound.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:57.350
And if we are right,
there's a strong prediction over here

00:05:57.374 --> 00:05:59.736
if I tell you the exact same ideas

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.404
using two very different sets of words,
