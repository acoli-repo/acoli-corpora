00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.480
Now see what will happen
when I connect them together

00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:32.645
by placing them on these two cylinders.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.101
(Clicking)

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.737
Now these two cylinders start to rotate.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.890
This rotation vibration
is going through the wood

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:45.919
and is going to couple
all the metronomes together.

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:47.555
And now listen to the click.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.246
(Synchronized clicking)

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.458
This is what you call
physical entrainment.
