00:07:29.217 --> 00:07:30.819
we scan his brain

00:07:30.843 --> 00:07:34.850
and then compare his brain responses
to the brain responses of the listeners

00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:36.676
listening to the story.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.910
You have to remember that producing speech
and comprehending speech

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:42.657
are very different processes.

00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.925
Here we're asking: How similar are they?

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.571
To our surprise,

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:52.466
we saw that all these complex
patterns within the listeners

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.197
actually came from the speaker brain.

00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:58.906
So production and comprehension
rely on very similar processes.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.502
And we also found
