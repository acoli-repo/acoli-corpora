00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:32.388
And when we did that, we didn't see
responses that are similar

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.693
in auditory cortices in language,

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.095
because the language
and sound are very different.

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.887
However, you can see
that the responses in high-order areas

00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.415
were still similar
across these two groups.

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:47.160
We believe this is because they understood
the story in a very similar way,

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:51.210
as we confirmed, using a test
after the story ended.

00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:56.008
And we think that this alignment
is necessary for communication.

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.658
For example, as you can tell,

00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:00.709
I am not a native English speaker.
