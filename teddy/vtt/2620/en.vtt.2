00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.714
we bring people to the fMRI scanner
and we scan their brains

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:06.638
while they are either telling
or listening to real-life stories.

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.286
And to give you a sense
of the stimulus we are using,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.294
let me play 20 seconds
from a story that we used,

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.642
told by a very talented storyteller,

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.817
Jim O'Grady.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.577
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out
my story and I know it's good,

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.891
and then I start to make it better --

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:26.399
(Laughter)

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.758
by adding an element of embellishment.

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:32.810
Reporters call this "making shit up."
