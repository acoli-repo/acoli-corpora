00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.925
how these neuron patterns in my brain

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.151
that are associated
with my memories and ideas

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.694
are transmitted into your brains.

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:43.070
And we think there are two factors
that enable us to communicate.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:47.149
First, your brain is now
physically coupled to the sound wave

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.648
that I'm transmitting to your brain.

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:53.050
And second, we developed
a common neural protocol

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:54.832
that enabled us to communicate.

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:56.721
So how do we know that?

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:59.185
In my lab in Princeton,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.714
we bring people to the fMRI scanner
and we scan their brains
