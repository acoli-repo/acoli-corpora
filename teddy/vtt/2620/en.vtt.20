00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:00.869
you're going to meet someone at a party,

00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:04.441
and you're going to tell him
about this lecture,

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:08.103
and suddenly it will be as if
he is standing now here with us.

00:10:08.127 --> 00:10:10.977
Now you can see
how we can take this mechanism

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.932
and try to transmit memories
and knowledge across people,

00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:17.003
which is wonderful, right?

00:10:17.027 --> 00:10:20.194
But our ability to communicate
relies on our ability

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.784
to have common ground.

00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:24.013
Because, for example,

00:10:24.037 --> 00:10:27.804
if I'm going to use the British synonym

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.206
"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"
