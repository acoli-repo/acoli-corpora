(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.648
And we flashed colors in the two brains

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:37.584
to indicate brain areas that respond
very similarly across people.

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:38.762
And as you can see,

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:42.554
this incoming sound induced entrainment
or alignment in all of the brains

00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:45.310
in auditory cortices
that process the sounds,

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.558
but it didn't spread
deeper into the brain.

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:51.455
Now we can take these sounds
and build words out of it.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.135
So if we take Jim O'Grady
and scramble the words,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.399
we'll get a list of words.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.685
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...
assorted facts ...

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.601
and right on ... pie man ...
potentially ... my stories
