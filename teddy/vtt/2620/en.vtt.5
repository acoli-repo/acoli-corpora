00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.959
the brain area is going up and down
in each one of them,

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.758
but the responses are very different,

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:35.449
and not in sync.

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:38.179
However, immediately
as the story is starting,

00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:39.889
something amazing is happening.

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:43.786
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story
and I know it's good,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.338
and then I start to make it --

00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:48.659
UH: Suddenly, you can see
that the responses in all of the subjects

00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:49.835
lock to the story,

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.288
and now they are going up and down
in a very similar way

00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:54.866
across all listeners.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.939
And in fact, this is exactly
what is happening now in your brains

00:02:57.963 --> 00:03:00.836
when you listen to my sound speaking.
