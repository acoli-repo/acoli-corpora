Imagine that you invented a device

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:04.577
that can record my memories,

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.638
my dreams, my ideas,

00:00:06.662 --> 00:00:08.325
and transmit them to your brain.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:11.830
That would be a game-changing
technology, right?

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:14.892
But in fact, we already
possess this device,

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.560
and it's called human communication system

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.432
and effective storytelling.

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.334
To understand how this device works,

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:24.773
we have to look into our brains.

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:28.383
And we have to formulate the question
in a slightly different manner.

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:29.870
Now we have to ask
