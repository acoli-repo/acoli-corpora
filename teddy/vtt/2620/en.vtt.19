that the pattern you have
now in your brains

00:09:50.743 --> 00:09:54.779
But I hope that at one point
in the talk we clicked, and you got me.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:58.701
And I think that in a few hours,
a few days, a few months,

00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:00.869
you're going to meet someone at a party,
