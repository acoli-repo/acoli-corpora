00:08:28.912 --> 00:08:32.249
How can we use it to transmit
a memory that I have

00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:34.459
from my brain to your brains?

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:37.155
So we did the following experiment.

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:40.221
We let people watch,
for the first time in their life,

00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:44.379
a TV episode from the BBC series
"Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.

00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:47.204
And then we asked them
to go back to the scanner

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:51.127
and tell the story to another person
that never watched the movie.

00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:52.811
So let's be specific.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:54.882
Think about this exact scene,

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:57.490
when Sherlock is entering
the cab in London

00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.810
driven by the murderer he is looking for.
