00:02:57.963 --> 00:03:00.836
when you listen to my sound speaking.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.868
We call this effect "neural entrainment."

00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:06.686
And to explain to you
what is neural entrainment,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.320
let me first explain
what is physical entrainment.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:12.826
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.846
Think of these five metronomes
as five brains.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.620
And similar to the listeners
before the story starts,

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:20.457
these metronomes are going to click,

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:22.640
but they're going to click out of phase.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.455
(Clicking)

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.480
Now see what will happen
when I connect them together
