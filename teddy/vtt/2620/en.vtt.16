00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.502
And we also found

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:04.232
the stronger the similarity
between the listener's brain

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.755
and the speaker's brain,

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.684
the better the communication.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.673
So I know that if you
are completely confused now,

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:13.718
and I do hope that this is not the case,

00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:16.135
your brain responses
are very different than mine.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:19.266
But I also know that if you really
understand me now,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.181
then your brain ... and your brain
... and your brain

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:23.933
are really similar to mine.

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:28.888
Now, let's take all
this information together and ask:

00:08:28.912 --> 00:08:32.249
How can we use it to transmit
a memory that I have
