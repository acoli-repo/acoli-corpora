in which a husband lost track
of his wife in the middle of a party,

00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:07.090
and he's calling his best friend, asking,
"Did you see my wife?"

00:11:07.836 --> 00:11:09.043
For half of the subjects,

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:13.208
we said that the wife was having
an affair with the best friend.

00:11:13.232 --> 00:11:14.383
For the other half,

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:19.512
we said that the wife is loyal
and the husband is very jealous.

00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.815

was enough to make the brain responses

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:28.208
of all the people that believed
the wife was having an affair

00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:30.669
be very similar in these high-order areas
