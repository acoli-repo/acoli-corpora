00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.009
the auditory cortex that processes
the sounds that come from the ear.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:03.477
And as you can see,
in this particular brain area,

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.993
the responses are going up and down
as the story is unfolding.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.610
Now we can take these responses

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.435
and compare them to the responses
in other listeners

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.934
in the same brain area.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.125
And we can ask:

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.384
How similar are the responses
across all listeners?

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.380
So here you can see five listeners.

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.436
And we start to scan their brains
before the story starts,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.999
when they're simply lying in the dark
and waiting for the story to begin.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.177
As you can see,

00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.959
the brain area is going up and down
in each one of them,
