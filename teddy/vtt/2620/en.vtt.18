00:09:00.398 --> 00:09:02.894
With me, as a viewer,

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:06.418
there is a specific brain pattern
in my brain when I watch it.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:10.951
Now, the exact same pattern,
I can reactivate in my brain again

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:14.631
by telling the word:
Sherlock, London, murderer.

00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:18.479
And when I'm transmitting
these words to your brains now,

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:20.988
you have to reconstruct it in your mind.

00:09:21.012 --> 00:09:25.561
In fact, we see that pattern
emerging now in your brains.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:28.100
And we were really surprised to see

00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:30.379
that the pattern you have
now in your brains
