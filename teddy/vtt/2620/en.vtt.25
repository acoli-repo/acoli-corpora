that communication relies
on a common ground.

00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:34.307
And we have to be
really worried as a society

00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:38.367
if we lose this common ground
and our ability to speak with people

take control of the mic,

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:49.284
and manipulate and control

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.693
But maybe one way to do it

00:12:54.717 --> 00:12:57.364
is to go back to the more
natural way of communication,

00:12:57.388 --> 00:12:58.990
which is a dialogue,

00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:01.521
in which it's not only me
speaking to you now,
