WEBVTT

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.105
We have wonderful music,
and a great music school.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.309
We have parkour dancers
who dance in the rubble of their homes.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.898
And Gaza is the only place
in the Arab world

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:45.317
where Muslims and Christians
live in strong brotherhood.

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:51.660
(Applause)

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.232
During the time of war,

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:57.328
the hardest part for me
is leaving the house early in the morning,

00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.022
leaving my children.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:03.379
I take a picture of them everyday
