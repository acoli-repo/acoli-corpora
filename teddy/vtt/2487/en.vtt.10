a huge part of the story
about Gaza will be missing.

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:08.126
There are some more stories
I could tell you about my country.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.426
And not all of them are bad.

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:15.564
I love my country, despite
the terrible situation we live in --

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:19.507
siege, poverty, unemployment --

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:20.900
but there is life.

00:05:21.644 --> 00:05:27.210
There are people who are dreamers
and amazing people full of energy.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.105
We have wonderful music,
and a great music school.
