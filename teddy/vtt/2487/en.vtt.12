I take a picture of them everyday

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:06.680
because I never know
if I will make it back to them.

00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:13.817
Being a fixer and a journalist
is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.211
But when I hear the sound of the shelling
or the sound of the bombing,

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:21.173
I just head straight toward it,

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:25.173
because I want to be there first,

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:29.094
because these stories should be told.
