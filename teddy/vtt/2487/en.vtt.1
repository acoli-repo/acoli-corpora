00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:32.192
But that didn't happen.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.832
Simply, I live in Gaza,
there is no airport.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.244
All borders are closed on every side.

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:44.426
We live in one of the biggest
prisons in the world.

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:49.648
The only thing I can do
is just to look up to the sky.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.735
On some days, we are lucky
if we have electricity

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.497
for four or five hours.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.164
When it's cold, we make a fire
on the front or on the roof of our homes.
