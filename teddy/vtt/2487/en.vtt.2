When it's cold, we make a fire
on the front or on the roof of our homes.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.322
Sometimes we make food, too.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:11.296
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything
for journalists who come to my homeland

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.548
to tell the stories
about what's going on in Gaza.

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.208
Many mornings,
I had to go to the border area

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:20.880
to collect a journalist.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:24.165
If anything should happen
to the journalist,

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.610
or if the journalist decides
to cover a story

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:31.332
the government doesn't want us to cover,
