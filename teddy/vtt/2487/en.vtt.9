And they drove us away,
far away in the middle of a field.

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:39.431
They took our cell phones

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:44.375
and we did the interview
with the kidnapper outside in that field.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.359
I was so scared that day,

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:49.906
a day I will never forget.

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:54.514
So, why do I do what I do?

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.363
I do it because I believe if I didn't,

00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:02.942
a huge part of the story
about Gaza will be missing.
