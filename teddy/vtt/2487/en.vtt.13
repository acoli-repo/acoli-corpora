00:06:31.603 --> 00:06:36.352
When my children were small
and we heard the sound of the war,

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:40.214
I used to tell them
that they were fireworks.

00:06:40.238 --> 00:06:43.336
Now they are older, they understand.

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.660
I do have terrible nightmares

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:51.898
because of all that I witnessed
during war times,

00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.177
especially these lifeless bodies
of young children.

00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:00.479
I still remember a little girl,
her name is Hala.
