00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:00.479
I still remember a little girl,
her name is Hala.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.233
She's the only survivor from her family.

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.878
Her picture will be with me forever.

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.270
I will never forget her.

00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:17.485
I'm proud that I can stand here
and be here today with you.

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:24.659
I'm proud that I can tell you
stories, sad and happy,

00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:29.161
stories about my small corner
of the world, Gaza.

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:34.174
I'm proud that I am
the first female fixer working in Gaza.
