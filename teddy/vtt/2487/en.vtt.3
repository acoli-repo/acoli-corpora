00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:31.332
the government doesn't want us to cover,

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.093
bad things could happen.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.986
Navigating through my country
helping journalists,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.622
filmmakers, news crews,
is my working life.

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:48.045
I believe my success comes
from building a relationship

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.340
not only with journalists
and the news crews,

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.481
but also with the communities
in the Gaza Strip.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:59.135
These communities who don't want
their stories to be told,

00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.718
I never looked to them
as stories or numbers.
