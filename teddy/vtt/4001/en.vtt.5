00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.130
isn't the technicals of how it works.

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.440
It's how you feel about it.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.995
Do you want this in your yard?

00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:37.705
Why not?

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:41.087
I got really curious about this question.

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:44.451
Why don't we see more
innovation in sanitation?

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:46.974
Why isn't that kind of thing
the new normal?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.790
And I care so much about this question,

00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:51.973

00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:53.901
We want to accelerate adoption

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.697
of sustainable building
and development practices.

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.465
We want more innovation.
