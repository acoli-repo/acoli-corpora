00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:32.394
That was Recode's -- my organization's --
first code-change campaign.

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:38.620
Here's a great example where
the Integrated Water Management approach

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:40.084
was the cheapest.

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:44.704
This is three high-rise residential
buildings in downtown Portland,

00:08:44.728 --> 00:08:47.308
and they're not flushing
to the sewer system.

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:48.491
How?

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:52.437
Well, their wash water
is getting reused to flush toilets,

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.128
cool mechanical systems,

00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:55.460
water the landscape.

00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:58.882
And then once the building
has thoroughly used everything --

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.429
aka, shat in it --
