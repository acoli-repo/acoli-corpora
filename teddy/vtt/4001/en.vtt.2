00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.169
And I want to explain how it works,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.638
but what words do I use?

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:09.123
I mean, I can use profane words
like "shit" and "piss,"

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:11.427
and then my grandma won't watch the video.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.831
Or I can use childish words
like "poo" and "pee." Eh.

00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:19.970
Or I can use scientific words
like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.

00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:21.261
I'll use a mix.

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:22.625
(Laughter)

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.654
It's all I got. (Laughs)

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:27.171
So, in this suburb,

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.120
the poo and the pee and the wash water
are going to this treatment plant
