00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.342
to a child.

00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:35.802
But this isn't just some problem
that we need to contain.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.613
If we flip this around,
we can create a resource

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:41.313
that can solve so many
of our other problems.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.138
And I want to get you
comfortable with this idea,

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:48.311
so imagine the things I'm going
to show you, these technologies,

00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:50.324
and this attitude that says,

00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:51.696
"We're going to reuse this.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.934
Let's design to make it beautiful" --

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.491
as advanced potty training.

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:56.538
(Laughter)

00:05:56.562 --> 00:05:58.288
I think you're ready for it.

00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:01.684
I think we as a culture are ready
for advanced potty training.
