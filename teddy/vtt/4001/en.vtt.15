If we can get that into our soil bank,

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:35.687
it's going to start to absorb
carbon dioxide that we put into the air.

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:38.464
And that could help
slow down global warming.

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:41.904
I want to show you some brave souls

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:46.234
who've had the courage to embrace
this advanced potty training approach.

00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:48.719
So those folks in New Mexico --

00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:50.123
why did they do it?

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:53.414
'Cause they're in a desert?
'Cause they save money? Yeah.

00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:56.833
But more importantly,
they felt comfortable

00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:01.060
seeing what was going
down the toilet as a resource.
