00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:02.255
about industrial pollutants
contaminating this reuse cycle.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.975
That can be addressed.

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:10.379
But we need to separate our discomfort
about talking about poo and pee

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:14.767
so we can calmly talk
about how we want to reuse it

00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:17.432
and what things we don't want to reuse.

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:18.612
And get this:

00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:22.393

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.072
we can start to slow down climate change.

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:28.136
Remember that carbon in the poop?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.850
If we can get that into our soil bank,
