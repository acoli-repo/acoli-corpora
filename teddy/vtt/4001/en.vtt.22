00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.423
We're talking about energy.

00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:02.818
It's cool to talk about energy.

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:06.183
Some folks are even talking
about the problems

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.373
with the limited resources
where our current energy is coming from.

00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:13.461
We encourage our best and brightest
to work on this issue --

00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:16.677
better solar panels,
better batteries, everything.

00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:21.209
So let's talk about where
our drinking water is coming from,

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:23.824
where our poo and pee are actually going.

00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:29.284
If we can get over this discomfort
with this entire topic,

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:32.364
we could create something
that creates our future goldmine.
