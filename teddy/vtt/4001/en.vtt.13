Chemical fertilizers by definition
don't have carbon in them.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:44.584
Imagine if we could move our animal manure
and our human manure to our soil,

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:48.414
we might not need to rely
on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:50.409
mine minerals from far away.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.863
Imagine how much energy we could save.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.290

00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:02.255

contaminating this reuse cycle.
