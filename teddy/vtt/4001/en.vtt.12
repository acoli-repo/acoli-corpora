00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:01.684
I think we as a culture are ready
for advanced potty training.

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:05.006
And there are three great
reasons to enroll today.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.310
Number one:

00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:08.992
we can fertilize our food.

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:11.528
Each one of us is pooping
and peeing something

00:06:11.552 --> 00:06:14.291
that could fertilize half
or maybe all of our food,

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.758
depending on our diet.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.335
That dark brown poo in the toilet
is dark brown because of what?

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:21.747
Dead stuff, bacteria.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.400
That's carbon.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.730
And carbon, if we're getting
that into the soil,

00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:28.785
is going to bind to the other minerals
and nutrients in there.

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.112
Boom! Healthier food.
