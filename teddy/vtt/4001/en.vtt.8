Seven million people get sick every year,

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.639
900 die annually.

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:05.853
And we're not taking a holistic
approach to making it better.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.782
So we're not solving it.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.424
Where I live in Portland, Oregon,

00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:14.251
I can't take Echo for a swim
during the rainy season,

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:17.383
because we dump raw sewage
sometimes into our river.

00:04:17.905 --> 00:04:21.130
Our rainwater and our sewage
go to the same treatment plant.

00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.896
Too much rain overflows into the river.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.545
And Portland is not alone here.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.659
