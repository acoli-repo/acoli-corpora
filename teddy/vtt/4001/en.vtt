Whenever I get to travel for work,

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.302
I try to find out where my
drinking water comes from,

00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:06.993
and where my poop and pee go.

00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:08.861
(Laughter)

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:11.912
This has earned me the nickname
"The Poo Princess" in my family,

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:15.913
and it's ruined many family vacations,
because this is not normal.

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:21.873
But thinking about where it all goes
is the first step in activating

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.712
what are actually superpowers
in our poop and pee.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:25.812
(Laughter)

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:26.990
Yeah.

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:28.172
And if we use them well,

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.347
we can live healthier
and more beautifully.
