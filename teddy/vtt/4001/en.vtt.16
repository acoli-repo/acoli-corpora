00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:01.060
seeing what was going
down the toilet as a resource.

00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:03.738
Here's an average house
in Portland, Oregon.

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:06.699
This house is special
because they have a composting toilet

00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:10.840
turning all their poo and pee,
over time, into a soil amendment.

00:08:11.547 --> 00:08:14.441
Their wash water, their shower water,
is going underground

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:16.353
to a series of mulch basins,

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.495
and then watering that orchard downhill.

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:22.247
When they went to get this permitted,

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.564
it wasn't allowed in Oregon.

00:08:25.222 --> 00:08:27.728
But it was allowed
in five other states nearby.

00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:32.394
That was Recode's -- my organization's --
first code-change campaign.
