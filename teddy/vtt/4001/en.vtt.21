00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:34.600
Imagine if we embraced
innovation for sanitation

00:10:34.624 --> 00:10:37.922
the way we have for, say, solar power.

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:42.120
Think about it -- solar power used
to be uncommon and unaffordable.

00:10:42.144 --> 00:10:45.697
Now it's more a part
of our web of power than ever before.

00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:47.704
And it's creating resiliency.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.964
We now have sources of power like the sun

00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:53.444
that don't vary with our earthly dramas.

00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:56.443
What's driving all that innovation?

00:10:57.002 --> 00:10:58.376
It's us.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.423
We're talking about energy.
