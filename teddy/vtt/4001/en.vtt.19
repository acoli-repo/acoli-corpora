00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:31.758
Brave and open-minded people
sat down and felt comfortable saying,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.910
"Yeah, that shit makes sense."

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:36.402
(Laughter)

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:37.667
"Let's do it."

00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:38.692
(Applause)

00:09:38.716 --> 00:09:39.867
You know?

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:42.040
I keep showing examples

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.222
where everyone's reusing
everything on-site.

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:45.397
Why?

00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.695
Well, when we look at our aging
infrastructure -- and it is old --

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.622
and we look at the cost of updating it,

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:55.253
three-quarters of that cost is just
the pipes snaking through our city.

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.845
So as we build anew, as we renovate,

00:09:57.869 --> 00:10:02.741
it might make more sense
to treat and reuse everything on-site.
