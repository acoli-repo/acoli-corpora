00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.120
the poo and the pee and the wash water
are going to this treatment plant

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:33.261
right in the middle of the community.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.946
It looks more like a park
than a treatment plant.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.356
The poo at the very bottom
of all those layers of gravel --

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.896
not touching anyone --

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.661
is providing solid food
for those marsh plants.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:47.519
And the clean, clear water
that comes out the other end

00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:51.304
is traveling underground
to water each person's yard.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.023
So even though they're in a desert,

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:54.904
they get their own personal oasis.

00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:59.175
This approach is called
Integrated Water Management,

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.579
or holistic or closed-loop.
