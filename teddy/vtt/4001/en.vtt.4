00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.579
or holistic or closed-loop.

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.588
Whatever you want to call it,

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:07.247
it's in conflict with the status quo
of how we think about sanitation,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:10.599
which is contain, treat, push it away.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.585
But in this approach,
we're doing one step better.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.971
We're designing for reuse
from the very beginning,

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.563
because everything does get reused,

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:20.741
only now we're planning for it.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.397
And often, that makes for
really beautiful spaces.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:29.107
But the most important thing
about this system

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.130
isn't the technicals of how it works.
