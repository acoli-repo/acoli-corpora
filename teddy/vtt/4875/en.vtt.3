00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.897
Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries

00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:32.886
of love,

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:33.693
grief,

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.802
and guilt,

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:39.451
while resisting simple interpretations 
or clear moral messages.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.075
And while they often hint 
at supernatural elements,

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:46.236
the true darkness they explore
is the human mind

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.029
and its propensity for self-destruction.

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.788
In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”
a ghastly murder

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:55.964
is juxtaposed with the killer’s 
tender empathy towards the victim –

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:59.239
a connection that soon 
returns to haunt him.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.121
The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead
