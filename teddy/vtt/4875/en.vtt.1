From the prisoner strapped 
under a descending pendulum blade,

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.951
to a raven who refuses 
to leave the narrator’s chamber,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.390
Poe’s macabre and innovative stories 
of gothic horror

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.058
have left a timeless mark on literature.

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:46.463
But just what is it that makes
Edgar Allan Poe

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.727
one of the greatest American authors?

00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:52.234
After all, horror was a popular
genre of the period,

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.286
with many practitioners.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:01:00.261
Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style.
