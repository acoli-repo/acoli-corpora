00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.121
The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.968
through the corpse 
of her husband’s second wife –

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:09.543
or at least the opium-addicted 
narrator thinks she does.

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:12.105
And when the protagonist 
of “William Wilson”

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.671
violently confronts a man 
he believes has been following him,

00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:19.515
he might just be staring 
at his own image in a mirror.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:23.188
Through his pioneering use 
of unreliable narrators,

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:26.185
Poe turns readers into active participants

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:29.424
who must decide when a storyteller
might be misinterpreting

00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:33.181
or even lying about the events 
they’re relating.
