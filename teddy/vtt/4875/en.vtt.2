00:00:54.286 --> 00:01:00.261
Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.584
As a literary critic,

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:05.502
he identified two cardinal rules 
for the short story form:

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.124
it must be short enough 
to read in one sitting,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:11.697
and every word 
must contribute to its purpose.

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.380
By mastering these rules,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.547
Poe commands the reader’s attention

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:19.864
and rewards them with an intense 
and singular experience –

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:23.219
what Poe called the unity of effect.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.087
Though often frightening,
this effect goes far beyond fear.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.897
Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries
