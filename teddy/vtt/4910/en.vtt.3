Answer in: 2

Answer in: 1

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:38.411
This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:41.771
known as Ramsey Theory developed from it.

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.361
Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems.


00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.341
This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.721
if you approach it systematically.


00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.011
Imagine you brought just three nodules.

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:57.821
Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue

00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:01.821
and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever.
