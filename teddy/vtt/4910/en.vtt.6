00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.480
If the connections were blue,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.510
then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.470
So the only way we could get in trouble

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.990
is if all the connections
between them were red.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.750
But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.579
No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle,

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.389
and open our doorway. 


00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.599
On the other hand,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.349
if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue,

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.379
the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.409
In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored,
