00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:32.341
using the chrono-nodules from your lab.

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.631
Activated nodules connect to each other

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.821
via red or blue tachyon entanglement.


00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.971
Activate more nodules and they’ll connect

00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.911
to all other nodules in the area.


00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.931
As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point,

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:53.801
it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:58.351
But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random,


00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.281
and there’s no way to choose
or change its color.
