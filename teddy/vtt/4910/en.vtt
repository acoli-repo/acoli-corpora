00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:11.521
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing.

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:16.921
Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal.

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.841
You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.251
and leaves him stranded in history.

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.821
Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close,

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.071
and your only way back will be 
to create a new one

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:32.341
using the chrono-nodules from your lab.
