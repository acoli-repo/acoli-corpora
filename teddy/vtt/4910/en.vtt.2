00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.281
and there’s no way to choose
or change its color.


00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.731
And there’s one more problem:

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:08.141
each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:12.061
that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it.

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.601
So the fewer you bring, the better.


00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.291
The portal’s about to close.

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:20.201
What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.906
to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present?

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:29.578
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself!
