00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:01.821
and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.181
Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.390
that don’t give a blue or red triangle.


00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.990
What about five?

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.680
It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.630
that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.560
These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.420
However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.520
Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case.
