00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.520
Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.310
Imagine activating the sixth nodule,


00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.460
and consider how it might connect
to the other five.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.000
It could do so in one of six ways:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.710
with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.520
Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.810
coming from this nodule.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.320
Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.990
of those same three color connections.


00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.480
If the connections were blue,
