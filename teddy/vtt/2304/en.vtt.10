00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Not a joke.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This is the conventional

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
nuclear fuel cycle.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The red line is what is done in

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where you reprocess.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, this is the normal way it's done.
