00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
learn a few of the mysteries about them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
How long have they been standing in what positions?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
what caused them to be the way they are.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
so you get a gratuitous picture

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of a moai with a comet.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I also have an archaeological project going on

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in Egypt.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We're trying to get all of the permissions

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to get everything all set, to get it going.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.
