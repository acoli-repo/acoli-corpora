00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You know.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
is that it is both an intellectual thing,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
because you're trying to reconstruct the environment

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
of millions of years ago.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It's something that can inform all sorts of science

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
in unexpected ways.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The study of dinosaurs led to the realization

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that there's a problem with asteroid impact,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
for example.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The study of dinosaurs may, literally,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
one day save the planet.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Study of the ancient climate is very important.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
had much higher CO2 than today,
