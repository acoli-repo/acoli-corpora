00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and went to a chef school in France.

I used to work, also while at Microsoft,

I've been on a team that won

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the world championship of barbecue.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods
