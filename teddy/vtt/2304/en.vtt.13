00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
this is how you would view it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
come in, and they just squish around the cell,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and they come back the other side.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Metamaterials, unfortunately --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A, it only works on microwave,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.
