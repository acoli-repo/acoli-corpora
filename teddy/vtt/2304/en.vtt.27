In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
had much higher CO2 than today,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
for the effects of CO2 on climate.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But, besides being intellectually

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and scientifically interesting, it's also very different

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
so we're not going to go into it further.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now, I'm also really big on photography.
