Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Where did they get that inspiration?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And then I met Yoyo,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and if you look at Yoyo's face,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
you kind of figure out where they got it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There's many mysteries, these statues.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
how did they transport them?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and she has detailed records of every single statue.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
