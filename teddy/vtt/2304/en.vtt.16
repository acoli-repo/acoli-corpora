00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
like chili, or bouillabaisse.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Various parts of the world will have a cult food

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that people get enormously attached to --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And I'm trying to use a very

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
scientific approach.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So, this is my latest cooker,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that's because it is.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you can make some terrific ribs.
