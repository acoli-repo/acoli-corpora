00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
There's -- no reactor's been even built

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
for 25 years.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
thing that we do.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Changing into a totally different field,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
particularly in an area called metamaterials.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
A metamaterial is an artificial material,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.
