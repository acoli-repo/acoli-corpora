00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I totally recommend that you do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He's got a great chapter about it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Basically, these people

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
committed ecological suicide

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in order to make more of these.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And somewhere along the line, somebody said,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"I know! Let's cut down the last tree

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and commit suicide, because

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we need more identical statues."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.
