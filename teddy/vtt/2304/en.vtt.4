00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and in response, I have ordered

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a bulletproof pocket protector.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm not sure what these people think,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because I don't speak Norsk.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I don't know, you know?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, one of the things that I love to do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to study past civilizations,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and see where they succeeded

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and where they failed.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Use science to, you know,
