00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
it's a zero billion dollar business, but,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in fact, it's negative.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
diseases in developing countries.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.
