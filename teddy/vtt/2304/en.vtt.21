00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Is that you?"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Laughter)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So, the SETI Institute,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and a variety of other people,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is building a dedicated radio telescope

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in Hat Creek, California,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
so they can do this SETI work.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and the one person who always gets updated

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is Jill, because I really don't want to miss

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
"the call."
