00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which is really quite interesting, because it turns out

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and you can learn an awful lot

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about the physics of the avian rectum.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
At this point, she stops me,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and she says, "Who are you?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Wha -- what do you do?"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I was stuck,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so, in some sense,
