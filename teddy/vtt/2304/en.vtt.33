00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I decided

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but embrace it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And say, "Yeah, you know, I --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
but that's really what works for me."

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
or metamaterials or whale sex,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
That's it, thank you.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
