00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's horrible conditions, because

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
wherever you have nice weather,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
plants grow,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, you always find dinosaurs

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
in deserts or badlands,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
areas that have very little plant growth

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and have flash floods in the spring.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
You know, skiers pray for snow?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Paleontologists pray for erosion.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So, you hike around

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You hike around, you see something like this.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
