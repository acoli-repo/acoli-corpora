00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You've got this bentonite clay,


00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which is -- sort of swells up and expands.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and you look up close, and you say,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
from the shape, that these are skull fragments.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And then when you look at this,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
you say, "That's a tooth.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's a big tooth."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It's about the size of a banana.
