00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where you reprocess.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, this is the normal way it's done.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's got the huge advantage that it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
does not create carbon pollution.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It has a lot of disadvantages:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
each one of these steps is extremely expensive,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it's potentially dangerous

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and they have the interesting property that the step

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which is a problem.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So, our reactor eliminates these steps,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.
