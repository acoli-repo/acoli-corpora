00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, I'm in Chile,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I have this picture up on my screen,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and a woman comes up behind me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And, you know, "Excuse me!"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I could sense

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
