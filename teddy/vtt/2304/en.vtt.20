She is risking her professional life on something

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that her own calculations show

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
My kids saw the movie,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and afterwards they came to me and they said,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"So, Dad, so -- so --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that character -- that's Jill, right?"

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Is that you?"
