Now, I'm also really big on photography.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I travel all over the world taking pictures --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
some of them good, most of them not.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
you've got to spend more time sorting through them.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
of king penguins on a beach.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and we had looked for a week,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And the last day, the sun comes out,
