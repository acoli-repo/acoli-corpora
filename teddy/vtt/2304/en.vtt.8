00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and she has detailed records of every single statue.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, this used to be completely smooth.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But after 1,000 years out in the weather,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
they look like this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
first because it's a way of preserving them.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,
