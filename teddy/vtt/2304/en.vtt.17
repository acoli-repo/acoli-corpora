00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you can make some terrific ribs.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is a high-speed centrifuge.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You should all have one in your kitchen,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
beside your Turbochef.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that of normal gravity,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You would not believe it!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I perform a series of ghoulish experiments

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
on food --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so that one can predict exactly
