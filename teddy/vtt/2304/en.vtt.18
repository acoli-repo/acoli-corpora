00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so that one can predict exactly

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what the internal cooking times are.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Theory is red,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
black is experiment.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So, I'm either really good at faking it,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or this particular model seems to work.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, another random thing I do

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
or SETI.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
which sort of popularized that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It turns out there are real people who go out

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
