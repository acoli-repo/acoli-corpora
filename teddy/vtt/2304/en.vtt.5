00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Use science to, you know,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And recently, I was in Easter Island,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is an incredibly beautiful place,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and an incredibly mysterious place,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because no matter where you go in Easter Island,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
you're struck by these statues, called the moai.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The place is 64 square miles.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Why on Earth? And if you haven't read

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I totally recommend that you do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He's got a great chapter about it.
