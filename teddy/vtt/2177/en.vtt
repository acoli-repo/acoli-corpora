00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.794
So, in 2016,

00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:07.690
I was commissioned
to produce a photo essay

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:10.796
about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:14.457
And that's been going on since 2014.

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:17.461
And I accepted the commission

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:21.926
with the idea that I would photograph
three generations of women

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.180
dealing with the crisis on a daily basis.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.903
I was fortunate to meet two best friends,

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:34.895
artists, activists and poets
