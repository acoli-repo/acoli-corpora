and justice has been denied.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.934
It's been five years,

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.320

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.633
I asked Amber, "What can I do?"

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:52.595
She told me about a man named Moses West
that she met in Puerto Rico,

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:59.569
who invented a 26,000-pound
atmospheric water generator.
