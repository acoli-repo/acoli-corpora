This community that sits
three miles from downtown

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.150
has been stripped of its schools,

00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:05.508
access to healthy grocery stores

00:07:05.532 --> 00:07:07.228
and clean water.

00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:10.563
Socially, it's viewed
as a violent, poor community.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.007
But I see something completely different.

00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:20.126
Moses, an officer, Ranger, veteran,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.571
was very clear about his
water rescue mission:

00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:29.794
Bring relief of free, clean water
to the people in Flint.
