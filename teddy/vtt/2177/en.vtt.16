It mechanically creates condensation,

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:07.690
which produces 2,000 gallons
of water per day.

00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:10.767
Residents are free
to walk up to the machine

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:15.712
anywhere between 9am and 8pm daily

00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.196
and take as much as they want,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.569
alleviating them from standing
in long lines for bottled water.

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:25.434
I've been at the machine,
interviewing people, asking them,

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:29.180
"What does it mean to see Moses
and his machine in [your] community?"

00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:33.284
And, "What has it been like
living without access to clean water?"
