(Applause)

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:08.546
The people in Flint deserve
access to clean water.

00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:10.712
Water is life.

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:13.212
It is the spirit that binds us

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:16.320
from sickness, death and destruction.

00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:21.199
Imagine how many millions
of lives we could save

00:10:21.223 --> 00:10:25.616
if Moses's machine were in places like
Newark, New Jersey,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.145
South Africa

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:28.329
and India,

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:32.643
with compassion instead of profit motives.
