General Motors has been cited
for dumping chemicals in the Flint River

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.092
for decades.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:11.489
When my photo essay "Flint is Family"
came out in August of 2016,

00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:13.334
it was released to remind America

00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:16.918
that although Flint
was no longer headline news,

00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:19.275
the water crisis was far from over.

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:21.450
And, of course, I knew

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:25.617
it was going to take more
than a series of photographs on my part

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:28.982
to bring relief to the people
in Vehicle City.
