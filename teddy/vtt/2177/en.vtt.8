00:03:57.457 --> 00:04:00.988
I mounted my solo exhibition,
"Flint is Family,"

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:04.649
here in New York City
at Gavin Brown's Enterprise

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:07.251
on West 127th Street.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.418
As the audience approaches
the facade of the building,

00:04:11.442 --> 00:04:13.309
they see a 30-foot billboard.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:17.426
The 30-foot billboard is made
of three large color negatives

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.879
with the message "Water Is Life,"

00:04:19.903 --> 00:04:23.841
spelled out in Nestle water bottles
by The Sister Tour.

00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:28.799
Nestle, the largest water-bottling
company in the world,

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:33.766
pumps 400 gallons of water per minute
out of aquifers in Lake Michigan,
