WEBVTT

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:33.766
pumps 400 gallons of water per minute
out of aquifers in Lake Michigan,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.544
nearly free of charge.

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:39.553
The company also extracts
millions of liters of water

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:42.291
from First Nation reservations,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.215
while they have no access
to clean water at all.

00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:50.704
This is a fundraiser print
that I used to raise money

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.720
to send The Sister Tour
to different venues

00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:56.725
to educate people on the ongoing crisis.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.690
I also continued to keep it
in the public eye
