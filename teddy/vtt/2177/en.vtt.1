00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:34.895
artists, activists and poets
Amber Hasan and Shea Cobb,

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:36.926
who took me around Flint.

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:41.381
As a school bus driver,
Shea Cobb became the central figure

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.560
of the photo essay,

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.385
along with her mother, Ms. Renée,

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.876
and her eight-year-old daughter, Zion.

00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:50.903
I obsessively followed
Shea's school bus routes.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:54.736
And when Shea wasn't driving the bus,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.466
she would be watching over Zion,
making sure she was studying.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:03.779
I embedded myself in every
intimate facet of Shea's life.
