00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which we will hope to see happen.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that will change the lives of many people.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
At the present time, it takes an average of three hours
