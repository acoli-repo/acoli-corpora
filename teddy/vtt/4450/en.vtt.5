WEBVTT

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:31.880
yet we normally have
about an 86 percent satisfaction rating

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:33.054
from our texters.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.183
What makes it so good?

00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:38.008
The technology, the data and the people.

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:39.823
So, the technology.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.529
It is not an app.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.156
It's not something you have to download.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.331
It's free,

00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:47.662
there's no complicated intake survey,

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.521
so it's really user-friendly.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:50.942
You just text us.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.204
We use machine learning
to stack-rank the queue

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:54.378
based on severity.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:59.422
Kind of like a hospital emergency room
would take the gunshot wound

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.371
before the kid with a sprained ankle.
