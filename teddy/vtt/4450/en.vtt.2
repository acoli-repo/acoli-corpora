My name is Nancy "Beth" Lublin.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.807
I'm the cofounder and CEO
of Crisis Text Line,

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.141
the free 24/7 service

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.641
that helps people by text and Messenger,

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:12.299
with mental health
and behavioral health issues.

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:14.792
And when I go on the platform
as a crisis counselor,

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:16.315
I use the alias "Beth."

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.513
I happen to be the crisis counselor
who took that conversation.

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:21.871
But this is what Crisis Text Line is.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:25.324
It's strangers helping strangers
in their darkest moments

00:01:25.348 --> 00:01:28.061
to stay alive, feel less alone,

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:30.597
and to remind them how strong they are.
