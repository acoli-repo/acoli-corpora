00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:01.862
like the gay teenager
who can't share with his parents,

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:04.550
because they keep telling him
to pray the gay away.

00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:07.139
Or the girl who can't sleep at 2am

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.012
because she's got anxiety about finals

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:12.137
and she doesn't want to disappoint
people who love her.

00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:13.627
So they text us.

00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.809
And we love on them.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.063
And we support them,

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:19.444
and we remind them how strong they are.

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.728
And we work on a plan
together to stay safe.

00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:25.260
And we tell them that if this felt good,

00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:26.434
sharing with us --

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.895
and 68 percent of people say
they've shared something with us

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.474
they've never shared with another human,
