00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.307
So we're going to bring our service
to countries and populations

00:09:02.331 --> 00:09:04.633
that have limited mental health services

00:09:04.657 --> 00:09:06.954
and almost no data about what's going on.

00:09:06.978 --> 00:09:10.002
These include immigrant
populations -- who have phones.

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:13.170
And young people, who are often
not counted in studies,

00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:14.914
but they have phones.

00:09:14.938 --> 00:09:16.682
So we're going to shift to language,

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:18.914
which makes the technology easier,

00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:20.522
because in addition to text,

00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:22.879
we're going to be using
WhatsApp and Messenger.

00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:26.791
And global expansion helps us
with middle-of-the-night capacity,

00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:28.974
because we'll have time-zone coverage.

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:30.172
So think about it,
