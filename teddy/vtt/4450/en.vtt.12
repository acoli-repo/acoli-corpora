00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.649
Our own data and external studies

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:03.188
show that we're very good at saving lives,

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:04.855
and at changing lives.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.894
We use the data to make it possible
for us to change systems.

00:06:10.196 --> 00:06:11.461
So for example,

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:14.585
we've learned the best way,
the best language to risk-assess

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:16.458
around suicidal ideation

00:06:16.482 --> 00:06:20.460
isn't to use the words,
"Are you thinking of committing suicide?"

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:22.810
Instead, it's to use words like,

00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:24.849
"Are you thinking of death or dying?"

00:06:24.873 --> 00:06:27.524
Or "Are you thinking
about killing yourself?"

00:06:27.548 --> 00:06:31.691
And now, we've shared that language
with journalists, to adopt this.
