00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:30.172
So think about it,

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:33.982
this will be strangers
helping strangers around the world.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.234
Like a giant global love machine.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.996
And the fact that the TED community
has supported our audacious dream

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.458
is just deeply, deeply meaningful,

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:48.314
to me and to everybody on our team.

00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:51.363
And the best way
for us to show our gratitude

00:09:51.387 --> 00:09:55.016
is to just let you know
that we are ready and we are fired up.

00:09:55.508 --> 00:09:57.271
And we're going to use this support

00:09:57.295 --> 00:10:00.361
to impact millions of lives
around the world.
