00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.371
before the kid with a sprained ankle.

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:02.728
We work the same way.

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:05.117
So we take the high-risk cases first.

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.403
So the person who swallowed
a bottle of pills

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:09.696
would come before someone else.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.053
This is data science to save lives.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.934
But it's humans who do the counseling.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.343
We've trained over 28,000
volunteer crisis counselors

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.010
who apply online,
go through a background check

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.177
and then about a 30-hour training.

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:25.406
And if they pass --

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.689
not everybody passes,

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:29.418
there's only a 33 percent pass rate --

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:32.418
they can save lives from their couch.
