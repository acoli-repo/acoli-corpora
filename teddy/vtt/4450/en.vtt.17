00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:32.866
Five languages in the next five years,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.090
covering 32 percent of the globe.

00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:37.104
And then, COVID happened.

00:08:37.462 --> 00:08:38.874
Things changed.

00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:41.498
And now five years feels like a luxury.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.511
So today, right now,

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:47.503
we are committing
to do it in half the time.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.484
Five languages in two and a half years.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.980
We're going to turn on Spanish everywhere,

00:08:53.004 --> 00:08:55.085
English everywhere, Portuguese everywhere,

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:56.363
French everywhere,

00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:57.831
and the fifth language?

00:08:57.855 --> 00:08:59.006
Arabic.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.307
So we're going to bring our service
to countries and populations
