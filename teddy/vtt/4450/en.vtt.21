00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:31.394
I don't know ...

00:10:32.117 --> 00:10:34.545
I don't know how she's quarantined

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:35.760
or who she's with,

00:10:35.784 --> 00:10:37.250
but I hope she's safe.

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:40.625
And I don't know, last year,
how she had our number,

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:44.033
or even how she had access
to a phone to reach out to us.

00:10:44.057 --> 00:10:45.366
I never asked her.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.898
Because it didn't matter.

00:10:46.922 --> 00:10:50.339
What mattered was
that she could contact us,

00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:53.180
that she did have it,
and we got help to her quickly.

00:10:53.204 --> 00:10:54.625
And that's the goal,

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:57.545
it's to make it easier
for people to get help

00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:59.169
than avoid getting help.
