00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:00.490
So far, we've been expanding
one country at a time:

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:05.426
Ireland, the UK, Canada --
which we did in both French and English.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.109
And we could keep growing,
one country at a time.

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.185
And it would take us decades

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:13.875
to reach even just a third
of the people in the world.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.018
And that's just not acceptable.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.633
We've already seen,
since the start of COVID in early March,

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:24.410
a 40 percent increase in our volume.

00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:26.572
78 percent of our conversations

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:30.672
include words like "freaked out,"
"scared," "panic."
