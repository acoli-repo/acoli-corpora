00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.571
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.524
two million years seems
like a really long time.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:09.041
But evolutionarily,
two million years is nothing.

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:11.018
And yet, in two million years,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:14.797
the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:19.030
going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound
brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:24.104
to the almost three-pound meatloaf
everybody here has between their ears.

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:27.907
What is it about a big brain

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.688
that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one?
