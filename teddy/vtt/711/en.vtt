00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I used to be a Malthusian.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This was my mental model of the world:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
exploding population, small planet;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's going to lead to ugly things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But I'm moving past Malthus,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because I think that we just might be about 150 years

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
from a kind of new enlightenment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's why.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the U.N.'s population data,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you may have seen, for the world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the world's population expected to top out

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.
