00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.565
so you can imagine the volume
of material that we've picked up.

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.538
My city has 6,000 employees,

00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:37.807
and none better
than my solid waste department.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.537
We send our trucks out
at the end of the day,

00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:42.793
they help the panhandlers
put into the truck

00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:45.060
the material they've picked up
during the day,

00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:46.587
and we take it to the landfill.

00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.375
I'm lucky that I have city employees

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.340
that are willing to work side by side
with our panhandlers.

00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:54.350
They're lifting up our city
while lifting up their lives.

00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:57.440
And like anything else --
listen, it takes resources.

00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:00.192
But the good news is it doesn't take much.
