00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:30.972
my old Dodge van,

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:33.306
my super-fantastic human being, Will,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.225
a great local nonprofit partner --

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.483
they drive to the corner,
there's a panhandler,

00:05:37.507 --> 00:05:39.761
they say, "Would you like
to work for the day?"

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.081
The panhandler says, "Yes,"

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:44.253
and Will says, "Great! I'll be back
in six weeks to pick you up."

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.300
(Laughter)

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:46.475
It wouldn't work.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.738
It's really important that we have
that agility in our program.

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:52.436
And they do the paperwork,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.984
they do the insurance,

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.329
they do all of the other forms
that I can't do quickly.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.949
We pay our panhandlers
nine dollars an hour.
