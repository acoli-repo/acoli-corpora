or you'd like to donate,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.015
please call 311,
our community service number.

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:10.354
So why is this guy standing
underneath my sign with his sign?

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.634
Well, we wondered
if anybody would call that 311 sign,

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:15.214
and as it turns out, they did --

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:16.969
11,000 times people called.

00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:19.057
I put those up in about 30 intersections.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.455
And we did connect them
with food and shelter and services.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.541
But yet he's still standing under my sign

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:26.447
with a sign that says he wants a job.

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:29.695
It's simple: he wants a job.
