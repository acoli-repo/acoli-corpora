00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.252
and I have one of the best
jobs in the world.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.710
I get to be the mayor
of a great American city,

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:34.302
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:41.391
I was at lunch on July 17, 2015,
in my great American city,

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:44.397
and on my way back to city hall,

00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.612
I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.032
As you can see, he's holding a sign,

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:50.971
and his sign says he wants a job.

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:53.515
But if you look closer at the picture,

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.778
you'll see he's standing
underneath a blue sign,

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:59.914
and that sign says, if you need help,
if you need food or shelter

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:01.195
or you'd like to donate,
