00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.997
because he's really one of the keys
to making this successful

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:02.621
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.832
You also need a great nonprofit partner.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.379
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.912
They've been in our community
for over 30 years.

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:12.449
They provide counseling, food, shelter,

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:13.876

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.652
They provide agility.

00:05:20.676 --> 00:05:22.889
You see, it takes me two weeks,

00:05:22.913 --> 00:05:24.683
maybe two months sometimes,

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.242
to onboard an employee
with the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:29.779
So you could imagine --

00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:30.972
my old Dodge van,
