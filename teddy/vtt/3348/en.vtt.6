00:02:57.757 --> 00:03:00.297
the Rio Grande runs through
the center of the city;

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:03.385
we're the home of the Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.573
On a day like today,

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:07.541
you could literally ski this morning
and golf this afternoon.

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:09.922
But there's always something to do --

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:12.048
always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:15.741
If you're going to have an initiative
like this in your city,

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.660
you have to ask yourself two questions.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.354
First one is: Is there anything
left to do in your city?

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:21.560
And if the answer is no,

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:23.992
would you please give me
your mayor's phone number,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.339
because I need some advice.

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:26.370
(Laughter)

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.661
But the second question
you have to ask is this:

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.049
Are your solutions to panhandling working?
