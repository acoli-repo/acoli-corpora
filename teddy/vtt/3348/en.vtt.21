00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:31.139
So you have to ask yourself:
Is it really making a difference?

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.172
Absolutely it's making a difference.

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:35.854
Albuquerque is now
one of the national leaders

00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:39.104
in combating some of the most stubborn
and persistent social issues

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:40.279
that we have.

00:10:40.303 --> 00:10:42.182
Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,

00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:43.397
the Better Way program,

00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:46.361
Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered
homelessness in our city

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:48.371
by 80 percent last year.

00:10:49.403 --> 00:10:50.717
Since I took over as mayor,

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:54.005
we've been able to reduce the chronic
homeless population in our city

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.258
by 40 percent.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.445
And by HUD's definition,

00:10:57.469 --> 00:10:59.162
we've gotten to functional zero,

00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:01.834
which means we've literally ended
veteran homelessness
