00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:01.834
which means we've literally ended
veteran homelessness

00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:03.198
in the city of Albuquerque,

00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:04.652
by being intentional.

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:07.982
(Applause)

00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:14.168
So I'm happy to report
that other cities are hearing about this,

00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:15.736
other mayors are calling us --

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.483
Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --

00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:21.043
and are now starting to implement programs

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:24.142
where they bring the dignity
of work to the equation.

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.021
And I can't wait to learn from them.

00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:28.722
I can't wait to see
what their experiment looks like,

00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:30.781
what their pilot project looks like,
