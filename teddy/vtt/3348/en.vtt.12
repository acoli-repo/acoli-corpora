00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:02.226
We feed them once at the jobsite.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.403
At the end of the day,

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.079
our old Dodge van takes them
right back to St. Martin's,

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.447
and they get connected
with counseling services.

00:06:09.783 --> 00:06:10.965
So far,

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.471
with the pilot program
and a couple days a week,

00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:16.158
and a fantastic human being
and a Dodge van,

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:19.578
we've cleaned up 400 city blocks
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:06:19.602 --> 00:06:24.085
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds
of trash, weeds and litter.

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:26.432
I don't know if you've ever
weighed a tumbleweed,

00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:27.737
but they don't weigh much,

00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.565
so you can imagine the volume
of material that we've picked up.
