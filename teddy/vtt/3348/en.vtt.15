00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:30.885
We have now housed 650 chronically
homeless, medically vulnerable --

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.715
frankly, most likely to die
on the streets in our city.

00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:36.726
We commissioned our university,
they studied it.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.404
We could tell the taxpayers,
we can save you 31.6 percent

00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:44.003
over the cost of leaving someone
to struggle for survival on the streets.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.428
We've now saved over five million dollars
while housing 650 people.

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.419
So we had that community trust,

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:53.658
but we had to have a little bit more
of an honest conversation also

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.169
as a community,

00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:57.219
because we had to get people to understand

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:59.786
that when they hand
those five dollars out the window,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.206
they might actually be minimizing
their opportunity
