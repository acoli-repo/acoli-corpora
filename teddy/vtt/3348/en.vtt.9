You need a super-fantastic
human being to drive that van.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:35.946
And my super-fantastic human being,
his name is Will.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.741
This is him in the yellow vest.

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:40.299
Will works at our local nonprofit partner.

00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:42.146
He works with the homeless every day.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.899
The panhandlers trust him,

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:46.072
he believes in them,

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.918
he hustles.

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.918
I like to say, "Where
there's a Will, there's a way."

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:54.320
So if you're going to do
the Better Way campaign in your city,

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:55.996
you need to find yourself a Will,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.997
because he's really one of the keys
to making this successful
