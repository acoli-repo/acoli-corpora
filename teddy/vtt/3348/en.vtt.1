00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:32.099
when we decided to think differently
about panhandling,

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:35.020
and lift people up
through the dignity of work.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:37.911
We call it, "There's a Better Way."

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:39.877
We call it There's a Better Way

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.939
because I believe there's a better way
to get the money you need

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.630
than panhandling on the corner.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.158
I believe there's a better way
to help your brothers and sisters in need

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.515
than handing a few dollars
out the car window.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.372
We know there's dignity in work.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.506
We also know that people are much more
likely to invest in themselves

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.170
if they believe that their community
is willing to invest in them first.
