Are your solutions to panhandling working?

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:33.972
If you're like Albuquerque,

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.642
and you're taking the punitive
approach like we used to,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.800
handing out tickets to panhandlers
or those who give them money,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.498
I'm going to suggest
that your solutions aren't working,

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.120
and I know you're not getting
to the root of your problem in your city.

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.406
So if you have something to do

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.786
and you need people
that need something to do,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.020
there's a better way.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:55.347
And the good news is,
it's not that complicated.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.316
This a 2006 Dodge van.

00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:01.326
It was in my motor pool
not doing anything.
