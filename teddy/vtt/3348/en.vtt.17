People ask,"Well, Albuquerque
is 600,000 people -- million, metro --

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:33.854
this wouldn't work in our city,
we're too big, we're too small."

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:36.573
I disagree; if you have
one panhandler on one city block,

00:08:36.597 --> 00:08:37.753
you can do this.

00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:40.395
If you live in a city
of eight-and-half million people,

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.574
you can do this.

00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:43.075
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.961
It's not the work that you do,
it's the dignity of the work.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.143
You could do anything.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:49.267
So I think any city could do this.

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.490
And people say to me,

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:52.578
"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:55.461
It can't work that way."

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:57.034
But I tell you what, friends:

00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:58.501
when you go to a street corner

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:01.453
and you engage with a panhandler
with dignity and respect,
