00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.948
to mental health substance abuse services

00:10:00.972 --> 00:10:02.668
through There's a Better Way.

00:10:02.692 --> 00:10:05.329
This is me just two weeks ago,

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:08.106
at St. Martin's,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.582
doing our point-in-time survey

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:10.983
that we do every two years.

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:14.962
I'm interviewing a gentleman
who's homeless, like we do,

00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:17.730
getting his information,
figuring out where he's from,

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:19.482
how he got there,

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:21.109
what we can do to help him.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:25.104
And you notice he's holding the same sign
that the guy was holding in 2015,

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:27.231
same sign I walked out with here today.

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:31.139
So you have to ask yourself:
Is it really making a difference?
