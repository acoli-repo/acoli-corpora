00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:01.326
It was in my motor pool
not doing anything.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.292
We put some new tires on it,
wrapped it with a logo.

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:08.111
This van now goes out to street corners
where our panhandlers are --

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:09.324
we go to them.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.302
We stop the van, we get out,

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:13.358
we ask them if they
would like a day's work

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:15.341
rather than panhandling for the day.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:18.700
And if you wondered
if they really mean it --

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.892
it takes us about an hour
to fill this van up in the morning,

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:26.335
because almost everybody we ask
takes a job for the day.

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.035
But you need more than just a van.

00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:32.511
You need a super-fantastic
human being to drive that van.
