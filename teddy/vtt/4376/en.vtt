Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:06.449
I'm honored to be here to talk to you,

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:11.656
and what I'm going to talk about today
is luck and justice

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.602
and the relation between them.

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:15.530
Some years ago,

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.952
a former student of mine called me

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:21.014
to talk about his daughter.

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:23.473
It turns out his daughter
was a high school senior,

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:28.521
was seriously interested
in applying to Swarthmore,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:29.847
where I taught,

00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:35.323
and he wanted to get my sense
of whether she would get in.
