00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.094
And my response was, "What's TED?"

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.356
Well, I mean, he told me,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.338
and TED then wasn't what it is now.

00:07:37.362 --> 00:07:38.825
But in the intervening years,

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.149
the talks I've given at TED
have been watched

00:07:41.173 --> 00:07:43.756
by more than 20 million people.

00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:46.713
So the conclusion is, I'm a lucky man.

00:07:46.737 --> 00:07:48.533
I'm lucky about my marriage.

00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:50.251
I'm lucky about my education.

00:07:50.275 --> 00:07:52.403
I'm lucky about my career.

00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:58.521
And I'm lucky to have had a platform
and a voice at something like TED.

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.673
Did I deserve the success I've had?
