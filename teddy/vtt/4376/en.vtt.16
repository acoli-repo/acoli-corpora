Did I deserve the success I've had?

00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:02.482
Sure I deserve that success,

00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:05.318
just as you probably deserve your success.

00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:10.757
But lots of people also deserve
successes like ours

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.718
who haven't had it.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.276
So do people get what they deserve?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.310
Is society just?

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:20.754
Of course not.

00:08:20.778 --> 00:08:26.794
Working hard and playing by the rules
is just no guarantee of anything.

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:31.118
If we appreciate the inevitability
of this kind of injustice
