In other words, we do
college admissions by lottery,

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:08.224
and maybe we do job offers
at tech companies by lottery,

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.605
and -- perish the thought --

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.024
maybe we even make decisions
about who gets invited to talk at TED

00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:15.276
by lottery.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.676
Now, don't misunderstand me,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.206
a lottery like this is not
going to eliminate the injustice.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.410
There will still be plenty of people
who don't get what they deserve.

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:28.568
But at least it's honest.

00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:34.738
It reveals the injustice for what it is
instead of pretending otherwise,
