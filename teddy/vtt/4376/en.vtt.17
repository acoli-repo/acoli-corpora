00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:31.118
If we appreciate the inevitability
of this kind of injustice

00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:33.718
and the centrality of good fortune,

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:36.171
we might ask ourselves

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:38.251
what responsibilities do we have

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:44.056
to the people we are now celebrating
as heroes in this time of the pandemic

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.591
when a serious illness
befalls their family

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:51.593
to make sure that they remain whole
and their lives aren't ruined

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:55.641
by the cost of dealing with the illness?

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:59.466
What do we owe people who struggle,

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.867
work hard and are less lucky than we are?
