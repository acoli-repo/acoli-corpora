It reveals the injustice for what it is

pressure balloon

00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:42.170
that our high school kids
are now living under.

00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:46.673
So why is it that this perfectly
reasonable proposal,

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:48.892
if I do say so myself,

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.165
doesn't get any serious discussion?

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:53.215
I think I know why.

00:04:53.663 --> 00:04:56.522
I think it's that we hate the idea

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:03.092
that really important things in life
might happen by luck or by chance,
