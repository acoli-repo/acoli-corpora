and he wanted to get my sense
of whether she would get in.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:39.681
Swarthmore is an extremely
hard school to get into.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.378
So I said, "Well, tell me about her."

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.135
And he told me about her,

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.706
what her grades were like,
her board scores,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.366
her extracurricular activities.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.446
And she just sounded like a superstar,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.580
wonderful, wonderful kid.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.164
So I said, "She sounds fabulous.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.850
She sounds like just the kind of student

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:02.140
that Swarthmore would love to have."
