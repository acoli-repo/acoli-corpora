00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.927
that in a just system, a fair system,

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:37.846
people get what they deserve.

00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:40.994
And what I was telling my former student

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:45.160
is that when it comes
to college admissions,

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:02.673
what you do is you create
a crazy competition
