As I was thinking about this,

00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:33.743
it occurred to me
there's a way to fix this problem.

00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:35.877
And here's what we could do:

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:39.573
when people apply to college,

00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:45.481
we distinguish between the applicants
who are good enough to be successful

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.324
and the ones who aren't,

00:03:47.348 --> 00:03:50.889
and we reject the ones who aren't
good enough to be successful,

00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:54.646
and then we take all of the others,
and we put their names in a hat,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.962
and we just pick them out at random

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.921
and admit them.

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:02.548
In other words, we do
college admissions by lottery,
