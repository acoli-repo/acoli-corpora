00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.430
I applied for it, I got it,

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.951
the only job I've ever applied for.

00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:06.378
I spent 45 years teaching at Swarthmore,

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:10.812
an institution that had an enormous impact
on the shape that my career took.

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.879
And to just give one last example,

00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:16.716
I was giving a talk about
some of my work in New York,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.813
and there was somebody in the audience
who came up to me after my talk.

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:22.229
He introduced himself.

00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:23.878
He said, "My name is Chris.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.212
Would you like to give a talk at TED?"

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.094
And my response was, "What's TED?"
