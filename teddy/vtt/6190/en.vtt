Most of us go through life trying
to do our best at whatever we do,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.376
whether it's our job, family, school

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.600
or anything else.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.040
I feel that way. I try my best.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.816
But some time ago, I came to a realization

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.616
that I wasn't getting much better
at the things I cared most about,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.816
whether it was being a husband or a friend

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.056
or a professional or teammate,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.096
and I wasn't improving
much at those things

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.656
even though I was spending a lot of time

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.880
working hard at them.
