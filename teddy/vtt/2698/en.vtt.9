00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.416
Generation after generation of veterans

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.696
have chosen not to talk
about their experiences,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.640
and suffer in solitude.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.896
I had my work cut out for me
when I got my first job

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.576
as an art therapist at the nation's
largest military medical center,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.800
Walter Reed.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.376
After working for a few years
on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.296
I eventually transferred to the National
Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.680
which leads TBI care
for active duty service members.
