Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box
to further contain him,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.216
and when the service member
went to leave the NICoE,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.280
he chose to leave BFIB behind.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.896
A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.616
and both times BFIB was smiling

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.800
and the service member
didn't feel anxious.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.336
Now, whenever that service member
is haunted by some traumatic memory,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800
he continues to paint.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.616
Every time he paints
these disturbing images,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.360
he sees them less or not at all.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.696
