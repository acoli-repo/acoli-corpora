as I entered the room,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.480
careful not to startle or agitate him.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.416
He lived out the remainder of his days

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.536
isolated and tight-lipped,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.336
never finding a way to express himself,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.120
and I didn't yet
have the tools to guide him.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.096
I wouldn't have a name
for my grandfather's condition

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880
until I was in my 20s.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.936
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.200
I naturally gravitated
towards the study of trauma.
