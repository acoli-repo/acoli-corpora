Due to advances

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.296

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.080

This physiological change,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.336
or speechless terror as it's often called,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.656
coupled with mental health stigma,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.416

has led to the invisible struggles
of our servicemen and women.
