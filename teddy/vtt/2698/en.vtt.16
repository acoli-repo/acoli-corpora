You zone out into the drawing,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.320
and for me, it just released the block,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.576
so I was able to do it.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.216
And then when I looked at it
after two days, I was like,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.576
"Holy crap, here's the picture,
here's the key, here's the puzzle,"

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.656
and then from there it just soared.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.136

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.696
And for the first time in 23 years,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.616
I could actually talk about stuff
openly to, like, anybody.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.736
I could talk to you about it
right now if I wanted to,
