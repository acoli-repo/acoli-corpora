Remember BFIB?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.336
That was a real experience
for one of my patients,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.816
and when he created his mask,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.720
he was able to let go
of that haunting image.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.936
Initially, it was a daunting process
for the service member,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.936
but eventually he began
to think of BFIB as the mask,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.616
not his internal wound,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.496
and he would go to leave each session,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.560
he would hand me the mask,
and say, "Melissa, take care of him."

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.736
Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box
to further contain him,
