Philosophers have told us
for thousands of years

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.976
that the power to create

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.760
is very closely linked
to the power to destroy.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.176
Now science is showing us
that the part of the brain

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.216
that registers a traumatic wound

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.120
can be the part of the brain
where healing happens too.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.880
And art therapy is showing us
how to make that connection.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.216
We asked one of our service members

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.576
to describe how mask-making
impacted his treatment,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200
and this is what he had to say.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.816

You sort of just zone out into the mask.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.296
You zone out into the drawing,
