00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's what I do in life -- telling stories,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
writing novels --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and today I would like to tell you a few stories

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
about the art of storytelling

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and also some supernatural creatures

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
called the djinni.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
glimpses of my personal story.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I will do so with the help of words, of course,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but also a geometrical shape, the circle,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so throughout my talk,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you will come across several circles.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was born in Strasbourg, France
