00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:05.430
What will the biggest challenges
of the 21st century turn out to be?

00:00:05.997 --> 00:00:09.597
Today, one might guess climate change,
public health, inequality,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.663
but the truth is we don't yet know.

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.197
What we do know

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.963
is that supercomputing
will have to be part of the solution.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.597
For nearly a hundred years,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.497
our reliance on high-performance computers

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.397
in the face of our most urgent challenges

00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:27.330
has grown and grown,

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:30.363
from cracking Nazi codes
to sequencing the human genome.
