00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:09.413
Many generations have
felt theyâ€™ve reached the pinnacle

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.579
of technological advancement.

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:16.871
Yet look back 100 years and
the technologies we take for granted today

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:19.246
would seem like impossible magic.

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:25.954
So will there be a point where we reach an
actual limit of technological progress?

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:29.996
And if so, are we anywhere
near that limit now?
