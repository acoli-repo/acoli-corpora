In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies,

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.060
NASA also spends a lot of time

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:36.353
figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations.

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:39.582
Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold,

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:42.634
motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that,

00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:46.253
despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about.

00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:49.331
Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.891
and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it,

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.017
but that day is still on the horizon.
