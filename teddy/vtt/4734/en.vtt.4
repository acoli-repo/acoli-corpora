make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:04.282
Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:06.677
can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.749
But we don't really know what's going on.

00:02:08.773 --> 00:02:11.482
We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness --

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.341

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.832
but none are totally reliable

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.902
nor can they handle
intense motion sickness

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:20.978
and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.102
during a long car ride.

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:25.666
At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.588
motion sickness is a serious problem.

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:30.595
In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies,
