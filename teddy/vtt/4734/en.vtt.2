00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.780
All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in,

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:04.069
how much you've accelerated,
even at what angle.

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:05.150
In a car,

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:07.721
your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement,

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:10.611
but your eyes don't see it,
especially when glued to a book.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:11.782
The opposite can happen.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.849
You're at the movies, and the camera
makes a sweeping move.

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:16.860
This time, your eyes think you're moving

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:18.944
while your ear knows you're sitting still.

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.189
But why does this conflicting information
make us feel so terrible?

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:23.382
Scientists aren't sure,

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.809
but they think there's
an evolutionary explanation.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.849
Fast moving vehicles and video recordings

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:30.264
have only existed
in the last couple of centuries,
