00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:30.264
have only existed
in the last couple of centuries,

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:31.706
a blink in evolutionary time.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.966
For most of our history,
there wasn't that much

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.784
that could cause this sensory mix-up,

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:36.879
except for poisons.

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.113
And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival,

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:43.145
our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.869
to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.016
It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.912
like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men,

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.234
or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers.

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.751
Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about

00:01:56.775 --> 00:01:58.434
the way some unfamiliar situations

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.952
make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture.
