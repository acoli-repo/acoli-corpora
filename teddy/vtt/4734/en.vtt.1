00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.692
Your eyes are seeing
the inside of a vehicle,

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:32.241
which doesn't seem to be moving.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.272
Meanwhile, your ear is telling
your brain you're accelerating.

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:36.435
Wait, your ear?

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:39.571
Your ear has another
important function besides hearing.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:43.402
In its innermost part lies a group of
structures known as the vestibular system,

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:45.713
which gives us our sense
of balance and movement.

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.797
Inside there are
three semicircular tubules

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:50.543
that can sense rotation,
one for each dimension of space.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.412
And there are also two hair-lined
sacks filled with fluid.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.976
When you move, the fluid
shifts and tickles the hairs,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.960
telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.780
All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in,
