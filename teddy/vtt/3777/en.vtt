When I was invited to give this talk 
a couple of months ago,

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.893
we discussed a number 
of titles with the organizers,

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:12.308
and a lot of different items were 
kicked around and were discussed.

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:14.349
But nobody suggested this one,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.278
and the reason for that
was two months ago,

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:20.190
Ebola was escalating exponentially

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.553
and spreading over wider geographic areas
than we had ever seen,

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:27.822
and the world was terrified, 
concerned and alarmed

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.790
by this disease, in a way we've not 
seen in recent history.
