00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:30.236
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment 
center, as many of you know, in the area.

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:33.330
The World Health Organization
and the partners that it works with

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.005
deployed eventually hundreds of people 
over the next two months

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:39.393
to be able to help track the virus.

00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:43.424
The problem, ladies and gentlemen,
is by then, this virus,

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:46.977
well known now as Ebola, 
had spread too far.

00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:50.186
It had already outstripped what was 
one of the largest responses

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:53.995
that had been mounted so far
to an Ebola outbreak.

00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:56.403
By the middle of the year,
not just Guinea

00:05:56.403 --> 00:06:00.366
but now Sierra Leone and Liberia
were also infected.
