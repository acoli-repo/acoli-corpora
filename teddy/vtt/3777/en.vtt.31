00:15:27.163 --> 00:15:31.217
And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,
there's absolutely no question now

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:37.018
that we can catch up with this outbreak 
in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.958
The big question, though, 
that many people are asking,

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.941
even when they saw this curve, they said,

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.845
"Well, hang on a minute --
that's great you can slow it down,

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.896
but can you actually
drive it down to zero?"

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:51.437
We already answered that question 
back at the beginning of this talk,

00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:55.590
when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.016
We told you the story
how Lofa County got to a situation

00:15:59.016 --> 00:16:01.829
where they have not seen
Ebola for eight weeks.
