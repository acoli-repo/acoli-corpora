00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:01.383
and to make it 
even more complicated,

00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:05.951
the virus itself was causing a symptom,
a type of a presentation

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.216
that wasn't classical of the disease.

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:12.631
So people didn't even recognize 
the disease, people who knew Ebola.

00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.490
For that reason it evaded detection 
for some time,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.660
But contrary to public belief 
sometimes these days,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.175
once the virus was detected, 
there was a rapid surge in of support.

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:30.236
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment 
center, as many of you know, in the area.
