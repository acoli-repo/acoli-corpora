The community and the health workers, 
Peter, they sat down together

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:35.168
and they put together a new plan 
for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:39.642
And the reason that this is such 
an important story, ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:44.736
is because today, this county, which is 
right at the center of this epidemic

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.563
you've been watching, 
you've been seeing in the newspapers,

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:51.306
you've been seeing on 
the television screens,

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:57.393
today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks
without seeing a single case of Ebola.

00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:04.439
(Applause)
