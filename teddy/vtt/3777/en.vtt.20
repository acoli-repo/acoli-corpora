00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:02.834
Around the world,
many people began to ask,

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:06.803
can we ever stop Ebola 
when it starts to spread like this?

00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:11.255
And they started to ask, how well 
do we really know this virus?

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:14.740
The reality is we don't know 
Ebola extremely well.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.735
It's a relatively modern disease
in terms of what we know about it.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:21.020
We've known the disease only for 40 years,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.502
since it first popped up
in Central Africa in 1976.

00:10:24.502 --> 00:10:27.582
But despite that, we do know many things:

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:31.805
We know that this virus
probably survives in a type of a bat.
