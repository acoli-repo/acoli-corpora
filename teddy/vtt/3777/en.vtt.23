00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:32.519
And then we've got to be able to have 
systems that can find every single case,

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.525
every contact of those cases,

00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:38.682
and begin to track the transmission chains
so that you can stop transmission.

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:42.304
We have to have treatment centers,
specialized Ebola treatment centers,

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:44.817
where the workers can be protected

00:11:44.817 --> 00:11:49.689
as they try to provide support
to the people who are infected,

00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:52.134
so that they might survive the disease.

00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:54.334
And then for those who do die,

00:11:54.334 --> 00:12:00.192
we have to ensure there is a safe, but at
the same time dignified, burial process,
