00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:32.346
And in doing so, the expectation would be
that there would be a huge outpouring

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:35.316
of international assistance
to help these countries

00:07:35.316 --> 00:07:39.034
which were in so much trouble
and concern at that time.

00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:42.111
But what we saw was 
something very different.

00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.869
There was some great response.

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:50.630
A number of countries came to assist --
many, many NGOs and others, as you know,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.046
but at the same time, the opposite 
happened in many places.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:58.161
Alarm escalated, and very soon 
these countries found themselves

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.556
not receiving the support they needed,
but increasingly isolated.
