00:11:54.334 --> 00:12:00.192
we have to ensure there is a safe, but at
the same time dignified, burial process,

00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:04.088
so that there is no spread 
at that time as well.

00:12:04.798 --> 00:12:09.299
So we do know how to stop Ebola, and these
strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:13.458
The virus was stopped in Nigeria 
by these four strategies

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:15.562
and the people implementing 
them, obviously.

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:19.584
It was stopped in Senegal, where it had
spread, and also in the other countries

00:12:19.584 --> 00:12:23.177
that were affected by this virus, 
in this outbreak.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:27.018
So there's no question that 
these strategies actually work.

00:12:27.018 --> 00:12:32.326
The big question, ladies and gentlemen,
was whether these strategies could work
