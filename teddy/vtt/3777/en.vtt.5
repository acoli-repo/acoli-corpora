00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.617
We are not allowed to wash 
the bodies to bury them

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.801
the way our communities and 
our rituals demand.

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.208
And for this reason, they were
deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.995
and the entire epidemic 
was unraveling in front of them.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.911
People were turning on the healthcare 
workers who had come,

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.265
the heroes who had come to try 
and help save the community,

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:53.184
to help work with the community,
and they were unable to access them.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:58.402
And what happened then was 
Peter explained to the leaders.

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:01.137
The leaders listened. 
They turned the tables.
