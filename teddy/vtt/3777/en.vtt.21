00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:31.805
We know that this virus
probably survives in a type of a bat.

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:34.921
We know that it probably enters 
a human population

00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.528
when we come in contact with a wild animal

00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:41.086
that has been infected with the virus 
and probably sickened by it.

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:44.307
Then we know that the virus
spreads from person to person

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:46.580
through contaminated body fluids.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.071
And as you've all seen,

00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:51.553
we know the horrific disease
that it then causes in humans,

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:56.071
where we see this disease cause
severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,

00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:02.541
and then unfortunately, in 70 percent
of the cases or often more, death.
