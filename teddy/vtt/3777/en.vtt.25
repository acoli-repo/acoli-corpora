The big question, ladies and gentlemen,
was whether these strategies could work

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:36.600
on this scale, in this situation,
with so many countries affected

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.206
with the kind of exponential 
growth that you saw.

00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:44.757
That was the big question that we were 
facing just two or three months ago.

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:48.801
Today we know the answer to that question.

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.779
And we know that answer 
because of the extraordinary work

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.546
of an incredible group of NGOs,
of governments, of local leaders,

00:12:56.546 --> 00:13:00.932
of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian 
and other organizations
