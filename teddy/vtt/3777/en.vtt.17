00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.404
In that situation,
ladies and gentleman,

00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:33.639
a virus like Ebola takes advantage.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:38.577
And what we saw then was something 
also we hadn't seen before.

00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:41.733
Not only did this virus 
continue in the places

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:45.324
where they'd already become infected,
but then it started to escalate

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.692
and we saw the case numbers
that you see here,

00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:50.746
something we'd never seen before
on such a scale,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.783
an exponential increase of Ebola cases

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:58.024
not just in these countries or the areas 
already infected in these countries

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:01.883
but also spreading further and 
deeper into these countries.
