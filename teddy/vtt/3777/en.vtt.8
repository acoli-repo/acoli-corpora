00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:04.439
(Applause)

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.872
Now, this doesn't mean that 
the job is done, obviously.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:11.128
There's still a huge risk
that there will be additional cases there.

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:14.392
But what it does teach us 
is that Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:16.049
That's the key thing.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.216
Even on this scale,

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:21.113
even with the rapid kind of growth
that we saw in this environment here,

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.571
we now know Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.562
When communities come together 
with health care workers, work together,

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.235
that's when this disease can be stopped.
