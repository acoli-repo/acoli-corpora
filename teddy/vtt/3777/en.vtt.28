00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:02.595
I saw presidents opening emergency
operation centers themselves against Ebola

00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:06.363
so that they could personally coordinate 
and oversee and champion

00:14:06.363 --> 00:14:10.450
this surge of international support 
to try and stop this disease.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.001
We saw militaries from within 
those countries and from far beyond

00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:16.741
coming in to help build 
Ebola treatment centers

00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.991
that could be used to isolate 
those who were sick.

00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:24.417
We saw the Red Cross movement working with
its partner agencies on the ground there

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:29.574
to help train the communities so that
they could actually safely bury their dead

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:32.132
in a dignified manner themselves.
