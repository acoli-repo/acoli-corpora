00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.825
And I'm sure you've all read
about this in the newspapers,

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.629
you've seen this in every magazine

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.528
that you come across,

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:08.328

the significance of this problem.

This is serious.

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:22.265
the strongest class of antibiotics

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.721
that we can throw at this bug.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:27.990
And you can see in 1999

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.185
this is the pattern of resistance,
