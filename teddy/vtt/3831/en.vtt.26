00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:02.006
the single drug that we have to 
treat malaria around the world

00:13:02.006 --> 00:13:05.220
in a way that's currently 
safe and efficacious.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.018
Mosquitos develop resistance.

00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:09.255
If you have kids, you probably 
know about head lice,

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.968
and if you're from New York City,

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:13.701
I understand that the 
specialty there is bedbugs.

00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:15.956
So those are also resistant.

00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:18.835
And we have to bring an
example from across the pond.

00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:21.190
Turns out that rats are 
also resistant to poisons.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.891
Now, what's common 
to all of these things is

00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:26.597
the idea that we've had these technologies

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:31.218
to control nature only for 
the last 70, 80 or 100 years
