00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:30.986
to make chicken and hogs grow faster.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.552
Just to save a few pennies
on the price of meat,

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.252
we've spent a lot of 
antibiotics on animals,

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:39.614
not for treatment, not for sick animals,

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:42.730
but primarily for growth promotion.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.587
Now, what did that lead us to?

00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:48.298
Basically, the massive use of antibiotics

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:49.783
around the world

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:53.587
has imposed such large
selection pressure on bacteria

00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:56.240
that resistance is now a problem,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.010
because we've now selected for just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.985
the resistant bacteria.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.825
And I'm sure you've all read
about this in the newspapers,
