00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:31.979
and they will become even more lucrative

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.060
when the price of new 
antibiotics starts going higher,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.957
and we've seen that the
market does actually respond,

00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:39.965
and the government is now considering

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.732
ways of subsidizing new 
antibiotics and development.

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:45.455
But there are challenges here.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.030
We don't want to just throw money at a problem.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.549
What we want to be able to do

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:50.828

00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:53.804
in ways that actually encourage

00:11:53.804 --> 00:11:56.824
appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,

00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:59.287
and that really is the challenge here.

00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:01.616
Now, going back to these technologies,
