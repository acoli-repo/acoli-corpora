00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:31.218
to control nature only for 
the last 70, 80 or 100 years

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:34.246
and essentially in a blink,

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.797
we have squandered our ability to control,

00:13:36.797 --> 00:13:39.288
because we have not recognized

00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:42.100
that natural selection and 
evolution was going to find

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.274
a way to get back,

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:45.323
and we need to completely rethink

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.666
how we're going to use

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:50.760
measures to control biological organisms,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.224
and rethink how we incentivize

00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.450
the development, introduction,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.118
in the case of antibiotics prescription,

00:13:59.118 --> 00:14:02.890
and use of these valuable resources.
