00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.671
and this was purely an 
informational feedback,

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:31.854
there was no shaming,

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:33.989
but essentially that provided 
some information back

00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:35.943
to surgeons that maybe they could rethink

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.172
how they were using antibiotics.

00:09:38.172 --> 00:09:40.186
Now, there's a lot that can be done

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.335
on the supply side as well.

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:44.112
If you look at the price of penicillin,

00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:45.763
the cost per day is about 10 cents.

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:47.521
It's a fairly cheap drug.

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.658
If you take drugs that have
been introduced since then —

00:09:49.658 --> 00:09:52.302
linezolid or daptomycin —

00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:54.180
those are significantly more expensive,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.631
so to a world that has been used to
paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.163
the idea of paying 180 dollars per day
