00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:31.685
He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.991
and fortunately for him,

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.041
a small team of doctors

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.930
led by a Dr. Howard Florey

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.997
had managed to synthesize

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.820
a very small amount of penicillin,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.901
a drug that had been discovered

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.223
12 years before by Alexander Fleming

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:49.930
but had never actually been 
used to treat a human,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.340
and indeed no one even 
knew if the drug would work,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.980
if it was full of impurities 
that would kill the patient,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.894
but Florey and his team figured

00:00:57.894 --> 00:00:59.616
if they had to use it, 
they might as well use it

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.181
on someone who was going to die anyway.
