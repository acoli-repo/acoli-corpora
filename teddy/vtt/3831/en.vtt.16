00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.220
to move away from using antibiotics,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.936
and if you think about it, what are 
good substitutes for antibiotics?

00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:08.100
Well, turns out that anything that reduces

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.343
the need for the antibiotic would really work,

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:13.485
so that could include improving
hospital infection control

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:16.380
or vaccinating people,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.677
particularly against 
the seasonal influenza.

00:08:18.677 --> 00:08:21.208
And the seasonal flu is probably

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:24.212
the biggest driver of antibiotic use,

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.131
both in this country as well
as in many other countries,

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.151
and that could really help.

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:33.254
A third option might include
something like tradeable permits.
