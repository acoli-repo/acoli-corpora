00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:04.160
The first patient to ever be 
treated with an antibiotic

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.693
was a policeman in Oxford.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.800
On his day off from work,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.173
he was scratched by a rose thorn
while working in the garden.

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:14.848
That small scratch became infected.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.163
Over the next few days, 
his head was swollen

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:18.884
with abscesses,

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:21.167
and in fact his eye was so infected

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.070
that they had to take it out,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.050
and by February of 1941,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.487
this poor man was on the verge of dying.

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:31.685
He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,
