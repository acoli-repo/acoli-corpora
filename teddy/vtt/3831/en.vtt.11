00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.930
and we can do this in a number of ways

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.160
that we'll talk about in a second,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.847
but the other option is the 
"drill, baby, drill" option,

00:05:36.847 --> 00:05:41.038
which in the case of antibiotics 
is to go find new antibiotics.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.100
Now, these are not separate.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.522
They're related, because if we invest heavily

00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:48.806
in new oil wells,

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.760
we reduce the incentives 
for conservation of oil

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.286
in the same way that's going 
to happen for antibiotics.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.454
The reverse is also going 
to happen, which is that

00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:58.792
if we use our antibiotics appropriately,

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.573
we don't necessarily have 
to make the investments
