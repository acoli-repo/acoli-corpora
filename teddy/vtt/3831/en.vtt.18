00:08:57.743 --> 00:09:00.344
Very often, people overuse antibiotics

00:09:00.344 --> 00:09:02.621
or prescribe too much without necessarily

00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:04.227
knowing that they do so,

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:05.658
and feedback mechanisms

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:07.560
have been found to be useful,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.489
both on energy —

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:11.029
When you tell someone that they're using

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:12.946
a lot of energy during peak hour,

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:14.416
they tend to cut back,

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.183
and the same sort of example has been performed

00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:17.993
even in the case of antibiotics.

00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:19.974
A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up

00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:24.166
on a chart the names of surgeons

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:26.385
in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.329
in the previous month,

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.671
and this was purely an 
informational feedback,
