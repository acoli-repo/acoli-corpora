00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.181
on someone who was going to die anyway.

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.836
So they gave Albert Alexander,

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.715
this Oxford policeman, the drug,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.132
and within 24 hours,

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:13.394
he started getting better.

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:17.370
His fever went down, 
his appetite came back.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.683
Second day, he was doing much better.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.921
They were starting to 
run out of penicillin,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.983
so what they would do 
was run with his urine

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.833
across the road to re-synthesize 
the penicillin from his urine

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.768
and give it back to him,

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:30.016
and that worked.
