00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:01.616
Now, going back to these technologies,

00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:03.979
you all remember the line from that famous

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:06.205
dinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:09.524
So it's not as if these are 
permanent solutions.

00:12:09.524 --> 00:12:13.610
We really have to remember that,
whatever the technology might be,

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.486
that nature will find some 
way to work around it.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.557
You might think, well, 
this is just a problem

00:12:18.557 --> 00:12:21.301
just with antibiotics and with bacteria,

00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:23.247
but it turns out that we 
have the exact same

00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.981
identical problem in 
many other fields as well,

00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:28.933
with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,

00:12:28.933 --> 00:12:32.495
which is a serious problem 
in India and South Africa.
