00:12:28.933 --> 00:12:32.495
which is a serious problem 
in India and South Africa.

00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:34.282
Thousands of patients are dying because

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:36.116
the second-line drugs are so expensive,

00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:38.343
and in some instances, even those don't work

00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:40.413
and you have XDR TB.

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:42.224
Viruses are becoming resistant.

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:45.390
Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.173
Right now, much of the world depends on

00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:50.870
one drug, artemisinin drugs,

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.826
essentially to treat malaria.

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.413
Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,

00:12:55.413 --> 00:12:57.767
and if this were to become widespread,

00:12:57.767 --> 00:12:59.115
that puts at risk

00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:02.006
the single drug that we have to 
treat malaria around the world
