affecting both rich and poor countries,

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.242
and at the heart of it, 
you might say, well,

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.170
isn't this really just a medical issue?

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.731
If we taught doctors how not 
to use antibiotics as much,

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.676
if we taught patients how 
not to demand antibiotics,

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.131
perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.120
and maybe the pharmaceutical companies

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.875
should be working harder to develop

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.511
more antibiotics.

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:21.890
Now, it turns out that there's something 
fundamental about antibiotics

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.673
which makes it different from other drugs,

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:25.694
which is that if I misuse antibiotics

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:27.431
or I use antibiotics,

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.291
not only am I affected but 
others are affected as well,
