00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:30.016
and that worked.

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:32.496
Day four, well on the way to recovery.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.134
This was a miracle.

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:38.370
Day five, they ran out of penicillin,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.637
and the poor man died.

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:43.350
So that story didn't end that well,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
but fortunately for 
millions of other people,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.706
like this child who was treated 
again in the early 1940s,

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.740
who was again dying of a sepsis,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.890
and within just six days, you can see,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.243
recovered thanks to this 
wonder drug, penicillin.
