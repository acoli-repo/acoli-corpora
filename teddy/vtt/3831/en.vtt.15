00:07:28.607 --> 00:07:30.153
of antibiotics as well.

00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:32.393
Now, if you think about how we deal with

00:07:32.393 --> 00:07:33.816
energy pricing, for instance,

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:35.665
we consider emissions taxes,

00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:38.249
which means we're imposing 
the costs of pollution

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.080
on people who actually use that energy.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.060
We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.771
and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.172
actually get used appropriately.

00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:51.200
There are clean energy subsidies,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.255
which are to switch to fuels
which don't pollute as much

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:57.100
or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.960
Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.220
to move away from using antibiotics,
