00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.163
the idea of paying 180 dollars per day

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:03.730
seems like a lot.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.717
But what is that really telling us?

00:10:05.717 --> 00:10:07.682
That price is telling us

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:09.580
that we should no longer

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.697
take cheap, effective 
antibiotics as a given

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.464
into the foreseeable future,

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:17.994
and that price is a signal to us

00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:19.603
that perhaps we need to be paying

00:10:19.603 --> 00:10:22.156
much more attention to conservation.

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:24.860
That price is also a signal

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.735
that maybe we need to start
looking at other technologies,

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:30.387
in the same way that 
gasoline prices are a signal
