00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.291
not only am I affected but 
others are affected as well,

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.629
in the same way as if I 
choose to drive to work

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.268
or take a plane to go somewhere,

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:38.242
that the costs I impose on others

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:40.682
through global climate change go everywhere,

00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:43.455
and I don't necessarily take
these costs into consideration.

00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:46.334
This is what economists might 
call a problem of the commons,

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:48.314
and the problem of the commons is exactly

00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.739
what we face in the case 
of antibiotics as well:

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:52.889
that we don't consider —

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.891
and we, including individuals, patients,

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:59.050
hospitals, entire health systems —

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.198
do not consider the costs 
that they impose on others
