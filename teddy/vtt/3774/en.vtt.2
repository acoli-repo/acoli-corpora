00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:01.914
is much better at creating terrorists
than it is at catching terrorists.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.097
In the 14 years since 9/11,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.681
you can count about six real 
terrorist attacks in the United States.

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.751
These include the Boston Marathon 
bombings in 2013,

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.040
as well as failed attacks,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.505
such as the time when 
a man named Faisal Shahzad

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.077
tried to deliver a car bomb
to Times Square.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.122
In those same 14 years,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.754
the Bureau, however, has bragged

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.335
about how it's foiled dozens
of terrorism plots.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.183
In all, the FBI has arrested
more than 175 people

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:32.629
in aggressive, undercover 
conterterrorism stings.
