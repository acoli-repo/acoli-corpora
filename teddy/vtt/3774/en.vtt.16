00:07:58.035 --> 00:08:01.187
the FBI arrested some potential 
ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:04.715
saying that they might
be headed to Syria,

00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:07.622
and were those real,
or examples of more of the same?

00:08:07.622 --> 00:08:10.636
TA: Well so far, we only know
what's come out in the court file,

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.641
but they seem to suggest it's another
example of the same.

00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.823
These types of sting operations 
have moved from flavor to flavor.

00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:18.991
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,

00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.305
and now the Islamic State
is the current flavor.

00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:24.874
What's worth noting about that case
is that the three men that were charged

00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:26.724
only began the plot to go to Syria

00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:28.801
after the introduction
of the FBI informant,

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.251
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
them with the travel documents
