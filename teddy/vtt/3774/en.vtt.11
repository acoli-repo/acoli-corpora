00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.421
Tom Rielly: So, those are some
pretty strong accusations,

00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:33.938
pretty strong charges.

00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:36.711
How can you back this up?

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.727
Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:41.795
when I received a grant from the 
Investigative Reporting Program

00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:42.730
at U.C. Berkeley,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.162
and a research assistant and I

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:46.635
put together a database
of all terrorism prosecutions

00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:49.638
at the time during 
the first decade after 9/11.

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:52.458
And we used the court file
to find out whether

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:55.881
the defendants had any connections
to international terrorist groups,

00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:57.364
whether an informant was used,

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:00.506
and whether the informant
played the role of an agent provocateur
