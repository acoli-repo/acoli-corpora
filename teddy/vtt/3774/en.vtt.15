00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:30.597
In this talk, I could only
highlight the things that they said,

00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:32.434
such as calling him a "retarded fool."

00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:33.916
But it was much more elaborate,

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:37.012
they went to great lengths
to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,

00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:40.068
which he then used to purchase weapons
from the undercover agent.

00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:41.208
When he went to trial,

00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:44.339

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.260
when in truth, these transcripts show
how the FBI orchestrated

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.660
someone who was essentially
mentally ill and broke

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.879
to get money to then 
pay for weapons

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.387
that they could then charge him
in a conspiracy for.

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:56.514
TR: One final question.

00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:58.035
Less than 10 days ago,

00:07:58.035 --> 00:08:01.187
the FBI arrested some potential 
ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,
