00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.940
with gangsters and 
crooked elected officials.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.402
The new target became terrorists,

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.823
and the pursuit of terrorists 
has consumed the FBI.

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.618
Every year, the Bureau spends
3.3 billion dollars

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:42.222
on domestic counterterrorism activities.

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:45.823
Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars
combined for organized crime,

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:47.999
financial fraud, public corruption


00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.777
and all other types of traditional
criminal activity.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.973
I've spent years pouring through
the case files

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:55.805
of terrorism prosecutions in 
the United States,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.074
and I've come to 
the conclusion that the FBI

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:01.914
is much better at creating terrorists
than it is at catching terrorists.
