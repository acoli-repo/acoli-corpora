00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.723
because my article is 
really leveraging the fact that

00:07:00.723 --> 00:07:03.208
a source had leaked to me
transcripts of these

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:06.155
private FBI conversations
that a federal judge had sealed

00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:08.556
based on the government's claim 
that their release

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.748
would irreparably damage 
the U.S. government's

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:12.852
law enforcement strategy.

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:15.831
So a place like The Intercept
was set up to protect journalists

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.890
and publish their work

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.719
when they're dealing with 
very sensitive matters like this.

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.618
So my story in The Intercept, 
which was just published today,

00:07:22.618 --> 00:07:25.953
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac
was set up in this FBI sting

00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:27.633
and goes into much greater detail.

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:30.597
In this talk, I could only
highlight the things that they said,
