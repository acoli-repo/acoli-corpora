00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.251
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
them with the travel documents

00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:33.167
that they needed.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.784
In kind of a comical turn 
in that particular case,

00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:37.850
one of the defendant's mother
had found out

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.016
that he was interested in going to Syria
and had hid his passport.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:43.949
So it's unclear that even if he had
showed up at the airport,

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:45.777
that he ever could have gone anywhere.

00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:49.420
So yes, there are people who might
be interested in joining the Islamic State

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.428
in the United States,

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:54.050
and those are people that the United 
States government should be looking at

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.329
to see if they're interested
in violence here.

00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:59.509
In this particular case, given
the evidence that's so far come out,

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:01.904
it suggests the FBI made
it possible for these guys
