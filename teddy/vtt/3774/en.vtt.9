00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.386
they helped him make a so-called
martyrdom video,

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:32.480
and they even gave 
him money for a taxi cab

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.944
so that he could get to where
they wanted him to go.

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.814
As they were working the sting,

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:41.327
the squad supervisor tells his agents
he wanted a Hollywood ending.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.168
And he got a Hollywood ending.

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.609
When Sami Osmakac attempted
to deliver what he thought

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:48.905
was a car bomb,

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:52.584
he was arrested, convicted and 
sentenced to 40 years in prison.

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:56.223
Sami Osmakac isn't alone.

00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:58.825
He's one of more than 
175 so-called terrorists,

00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:01.803
for whom the FBI has created 
Hollywood endings.
