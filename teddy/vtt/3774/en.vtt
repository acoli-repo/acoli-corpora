00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.504
The FBI is responsible
for more terrorism plots

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.175
in the United States

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:07.771
than any other organization.

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:09.625
More than al Qaeda,

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.010
more than al Shabaab,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560
more than the Islamic State,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.354
more than all of them combined.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.011
This isn't likely how you
think about the FBI.

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:22.066
You probably think of FBI agents
gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.207
or arresting corrupt politicians.

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.858
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:28.331
the FBI became less concerned 


00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.940
with gangsters and 
crooked elected officials.
