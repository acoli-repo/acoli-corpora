Growing up, one of my fondest memories

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:08.726
was of going to a local market
with my mom every month

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.000
in the small town in India where we lived.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.809
We would spend the morning
walking through an intricate maze

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.434
of small stores and street vendors,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.518
stopping at her favorite spots
where everyone knew her,

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:25.059
discovering what fruits were in season

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:27.268
and what kitchenware was in stock.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:31.226
She would spend hours
examining things from all angles,
