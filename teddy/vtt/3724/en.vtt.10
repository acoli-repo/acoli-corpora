Well, we recently showed

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.860
that you can take the cellular
machinery out of a living cell

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:07.976
and freeze-dry it along with
RNA sensors onto paper

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.916
in order to create low-cost
diagnostics for Ebola and Zika.

00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:18.730
The sensors are activated when
they're rehydrated by a patient sample

00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:21.576
that could consist of blood
or saliva, for example.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.861
It turns out, this technology
is not limited to paper

00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:27.771
and can be applied
to other materials, including cloth.

00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:30.613
For the COVID-19 pandemic,
