00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:03.018
In one or two hours, a patient
could thus be diagnosed

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:06.014
safely, remotely and accurately.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:09.255
We're also using synthetic biology

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.999
to design a candidate
vaccine for COVID-19.

00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:15.667
We are repurposing the BCG vaccine,

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:18.561
which had been used against TB
for almost a century.

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.126
It's a live attenuated vaccine,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.807
and we're engineering it
to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens,

00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.645
which should trigger the production
of protective antibodies

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.304
by the immune system.

00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:32.062
Importantly, BCG
is massively scalable
