00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:31.691
In the case of halicin,

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:33.830
after one day,
we didn't see any resistance.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.781
Amazingly, after even 30 days,

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:40.406
we didn't see any resistance
against halicin.

00:03:41.098 --> 00:03:46.624
In this pilot project, we first tested
roughly 2,500 compounds against E. coli.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.039
This training set included
known antibiotics,

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.809
such as Cipro and penicillin,

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.105
as well as many drugs
that are not antibiotics.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.571
These data we used to train a model

00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:01.573
to learn molecular features
associated with antibacterial activity.
