00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.825
So how are we going to beat
this novel coronavirus?

00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:06.948
By using our best tools:

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.011
our science and our technology.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:12.726
In my lab, we're using
the tools of artificial intelligence

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.329
and synthetic biology

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.413
to speed up the fight
against this pandemic.

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:19.941
Our work was originally designed

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.818
to tackle the antibiotic
resistance crisis.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:27.531
Our project seeks to harness
the power of machine learning

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:29.401
to replenish our antibiotic arsenal

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:33.263
and avoid a globally devastating
postantibiotic era.
