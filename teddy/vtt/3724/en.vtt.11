For the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:05:30.637 --> 00:05:34.983
we're designing RNA sensors
to detect the virus

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:38.217
and freeze-drying these
along with the needed cellular machinery

00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:40.948
into the fabric of a face mask,

00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:43.201
where the simple act of breathing,

00:05:43.225 --> 00:05:45.502
along with the water vapor
that comes with it,

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:47.286
can activate the test.

00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:52.064
Thus, if a patient is infected
with SARS-CoV-2,

00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:54.161
the mask will produce
a fluorescent signal

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:58.015
that could be detected by a simple,
inexpensive handheld device.

00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:03.018
In one or two hours, a patient
could thus be diagnosed
