Halicin has potent antibacterial activity

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.382
against almost all antibiotic-resistant
bacterial pathogens,

00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:09.047
including untreatable
panresistant infections.

00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:12.132
Importantly, in contrast
to current antibiotics,

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:15.850
the frequency at which bacteria
develop resistance against halicin

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:17.358
is remarkably low.

00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:23.013
We tested the ability of bacteria
to evolve resistance against halicin

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:24.825
as well as Cipro in the lab.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.841
In the case of Cipro,

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:29.690
after just one day, we saw resistance.
