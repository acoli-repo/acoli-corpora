00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.367
These data will be use to train
a machine learning model

00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:35.461
that will be applied to an in silico
library of over a billion molecules

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:39.689
to search for potential
novel antiviral compounds.

00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:42.982
We will synthesize and test
the top predictions

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:45.895
and advance the most promising
candidates into the clinic.

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.134
Sound too good to be true?

00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:49.590
Well, it shouldn't.

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:52.939
The Antibiotics AI Project is founded
on our proof of concept research

00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:56.364
that led to the discovery
of a novel broad-spectrum antibiotic

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:57.573
called halicin.

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.256
Halicin has potent antibacterial activity
