00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.513
we can train a computer
to explore the exponentially larger space

00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:04.121
of essentially all possible molecules
that could be synthesized,

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:09.759
and thus, instead of looking
for a needle in a haystack,

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:13.543
we can use the giant magnet
of computing power

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:17.482
to find many needles
in multiple haystacks simultaneously.

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:20.415
We've already had some early success.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.475
Recently, we used machine learning
to discover new antibiotics

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.059
that can help us fight off
the bacterial infections

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:32.694
that can occur alongside
SARS-CoV-2 infections.
