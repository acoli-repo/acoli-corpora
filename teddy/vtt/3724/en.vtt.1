00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:33.263
and avoid a globally devastating
postantibiotic era.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:36.505
Importantly, the same
technology can be used

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:38.601
to search for antiviral compounds

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.303
that could help us fight
the current pandemic.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.982
Machine learning is turning
the traditional model of drug discovery

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:47.410
on its head.

00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:48.659
With this approach,

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:52.761
instead of painstakingly testing
thousands of existing molecules

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.221
one by one in a lab

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:55.832
for their effectiveness,

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.513
we can train a computer
to explore the exponentially larger space
