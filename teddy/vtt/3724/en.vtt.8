00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:01.573
to learn molecular features
associated with antibacterial activity.

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.970
We then applied this model
to a drug-repurposing library

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.472
consisting of several thousand molecules

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:10.114
and asked the model to identify molecules

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:12.922
that are predicted
to have antibacterial properties

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:15.419
but don't look like existing antibiotics.

00:04:16.427 --> 00:04:21.224
Interestingly, only one molecule
in that library fit these criteria,

00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:23.584
and that molecule
turned out to be halicin.

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:27.532
Given that halicin does not look
like any existing antibiotic,

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:31.710
it would have been impossible for a human,
including an antibiotic expert,
