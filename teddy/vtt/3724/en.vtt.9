00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:31.710
it would have been impossible for a human,
including an antibiotic expert,

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:33.918
to identify halicin in this manner.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.204
Imagine now what we could do
with this technology

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:38.969
against SARS-CoV-2.

00:04:39.783 --> 00:04:41.148
And that's not all.

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:43.992
We're also using the tools
of synthetic biology,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.627
tinkering with DNA
and other cellular machinery,

00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:50.561
to serve human purposes
like combating COVID-19,

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:54.232
and of note, we are working
to develop a protective mask

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:57.688
that can also serve
as a rapid diagnostic test.

00:04:58.192 --> 00:04:59.664
So how does that work?

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:00.893
Well, we recently showed
