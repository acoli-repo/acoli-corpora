While the quest for new antibiotics
is for our medium-term future,

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:06.277
the novel coronavirus poses
an immediate deadly threat,

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.094
and I'm excited to share that we think
we can use the same technology

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:12.927
to search for therapeutics
to fight this virus.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:15.205
So how are we going to do it?

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.177
Well, we're creating
a compound training library

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:23.743
and with collaborators applying these
molecules to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.661
to see which of them exhibit
effective activity.

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.367
These data will be use to train
a machine learning model
