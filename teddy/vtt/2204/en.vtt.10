collecting data, building UI,
integrating into legacy systems;

00:05:01.358 --> 00:05:04.262
But 70 percent, the bulk of the effort,

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:08.762
is about weaving together AI
with people and processes

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:11.160
to maximize real outcome.

00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:16.770
AI fails when cutting short
on the 70 percent.

00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:19.953
The price tag for that can be small,

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:23.962
wasting many, many millions
of dollars on useless technology.

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.136
Anyone cares?

00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:28.478
Or real tragedies:

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:36.652
346 casualties in the recent crashes
of two B-737 aircrafts
