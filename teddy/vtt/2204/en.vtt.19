00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:33.946
Seventy-five percent
of the corrections made by a human

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.025
were reducing accuracy.

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:40.176
Was it time to get rid of human buyers?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.358
No.

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:43.999
It was time to recreate a model

00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:49.094
where humans would not try
to guess when AI is wrong,

00:09:49.118 --> 00:09:53.660
but where AI would take real input
from human buyers.

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:56.573
We fully rebuilt the model

00:09:56.597 --> 00:10:02.561
and went away from our initial interface,
which was, more or less,
