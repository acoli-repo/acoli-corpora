00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:02.992
Let me share a paradox.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:05.896
For the last 10 years,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.768
many companies have been trying
to become less bureaucratic,

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.625
to have fewer central rules
and procedures,

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.894
more autonomy for their local
teams to be more agile.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:20.790
And now they are pushing
artificial intelligence, AI,

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:23.259
unaware that cool technology

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:26.885
might make them
more bureaucratic than ever.

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:28.529
Why?

00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:32.045
Because AI operates
just like bureaucracies.
