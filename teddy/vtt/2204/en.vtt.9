00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:30.010
No, algos don't change their mind.

00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:32.990
We have a choice here.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.280
Carry on with algocracy

00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:39.169
or decide to go to "Human plus AI."

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:40.526
And to do this,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.990
we need to stop thinking tech first,

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:47.664
and we need to start applying
the secret formula.

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.704
To deploy "Human plus AI,"

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.649
10 percent of the effort is to code algos;

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:57.204
20 percent to build tech
around the algos,

00:04:57.228 --> 00:05:01.334
collecting data, building UI,
integrating into legacy systems;
