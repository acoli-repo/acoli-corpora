They want to take costly,
old-fashioned humans out of the loop

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.585
and rely only upon AI to take decisions.

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:41.497
I call this the "human-zero mindset."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.378
And why is it so tempting?

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:50.283
Because the other route,
"Human plus AI," is long,

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:52.916
costly and difficult.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.233
Business teams, tech teams,
data-science teams

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:58.336
have to iterate for months

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.628
to craft exactly how humans and AI
can best work together.
