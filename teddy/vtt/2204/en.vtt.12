One of our teams worked on a new drug
with a slight problem.

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:02.283
When taking their first dose,

00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:05.791
some patients, very few,
have heart attacks.

00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:09.252
So, all patients,
when taking their first dose,

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:11.958
have to spend one day in hospital,

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:14.053
for monitoring, just in case.

00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:20.169
Our objective was to identify patients
who were at zero risk of heart attacks,

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.526
who could skip the day in hospital.

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:27.041
We used AI to analyze data
from clinical trials,

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:32.513
to correlate ECG signal,
blood composition, biomarkers,
