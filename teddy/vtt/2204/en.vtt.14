00:06:56.292 --> 00:07:01.521
meaning people who are told by AI
they can stay at home, and die?

00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:02.910
(Laughter)

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:05.386
There started our 70 percent.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.402
We worked with a team of doctors

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:11.225
to check the medical logic
of each variable in our model.

00:07:11.537 --> 00:07:16.106
For instance, we were using
the concentration of a liver enzyme

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.403
as a predictor,

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:21.125
for which the medical logic
was not obvious.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.815
The statistical signal was quite strong.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.133
But what if it was a bias in our sample?

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:29.957
That predictor was taken out of the model.
