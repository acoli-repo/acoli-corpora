than our designers."

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:42.410
Our team trained a model in a few weeks,
on past sales data,

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:45.967
and the competition was organized
with human buyers.

00:08:46.347 --> 00:08:47.497
Result?

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:52.743
AI wins, reducing forecasting
errors by 25 percent.

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:58.736
Human-zero champions could have tried
to implement this initial model

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.514
and create a fight with all human buyers.
