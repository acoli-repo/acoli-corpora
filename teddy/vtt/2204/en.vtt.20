"Hey, human! This is what I forecast,

00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:06.807
correct whatever you want,"

00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:10.467
and moved to a much richer one, more like,

00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:12.467
"Hey, humans!

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:14.316
I don't know the trends for next year.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.296

00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:25.623
I cannot find any good comparables
in the past for them."

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:27.551
Result?

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.195
"Human plus AI" wins,
