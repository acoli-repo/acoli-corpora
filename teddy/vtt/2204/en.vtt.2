I call it "algocracy" --

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:05.061
where AI will take more and more
critical decisions by the rules

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.402
outside of any human control.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.101
Is there a real risk?

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:11.664
Yes.

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:14.694
I'm leading a team of 800 AI specialists.

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:18.575
We have deployed
over 100 customized AI solutions

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.066
for large companies around the world.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:27.236
And I see too many corporate executives
behaving like bureaucrats from the past.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:32.696
They want to take costly,
old-fashioned humans out of the loop
