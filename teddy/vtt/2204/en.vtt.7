00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:32.511
Take an AI engine rejecting
a student application for university.

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:33.685
Why?

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.379
Because it has "learned," on past data,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.585
characteristics of students
that will pass and fail.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.712
Some are obvious, like GPAs.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.178
But if, in the past, all students
from a given postal code have failed,

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:50.734
it is very likely
that AI will make this a rule

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:54.528
and will reject every student
with this postal code,

00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:59.365
not giving anyone the opportunity
to prove the rule wrong.

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.373
And no one can check all the rules,
