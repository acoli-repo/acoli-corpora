And no one can check all the rules,

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:05.849
because advanced AI
is constantly learning.

00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:08.633
And if humans are kept out of the room,

00:04:08.657 --> 00:04:11.934
there comes the algocratic nightmare.

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.323
Who is accountable
for rejecting the student?

00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:16.990
No one, AI did.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.688
Is it fair? Yes.

00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:21.954
The same set of objective rules
has been applied to everyone.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:26.269
Could we reconsider for this bright kid
with the wrong postal code?

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:30.010
No, algos don't change their mind.
