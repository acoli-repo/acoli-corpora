No matter how temptingly you email me,

00:03:01.863 --> 00:03:04.212
I am not going to think, 'Oh, go on, then,

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.376
one more toilet seat,
I'll treat myself.' "

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.744
(Laughter)

00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:12.386
Sometimes, with more consequence,
like in this other tweet.

00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:14.690
"Had the same situation

00:03:14.714 --> 00:03:17.173
with my mother's burial urn."

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.205
(Laughter)

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.594
"For months after her death,

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:23.166
I got messages from Amazon,
saying, 'If you liked that ...' "

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.205
(Laughter)

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.757
Sometimes with worse consequences.

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:32.511
