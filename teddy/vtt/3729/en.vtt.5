00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.351
Over the course of many experiments,

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:32.726
we were able to demonstrate

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.476
that the inertness of plant tissue
is exactly why it's so biocompatible.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.643
In a way, the body
almost doesn't even see it,

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:45.226
but regenerating cells
benefit from its shape and stability.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.851
Now this is all well and good,

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.018
but I constantly felt this weight of doubt

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:51.559
when it came to thinking
about spinal cords.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:55.434
So many scientists were using
materials from traditional sources,

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.934
like synthetic polymers
and animal products --

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.684
even human cadavers.

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.643
I felt like a complete outsider
