00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.643
I felt like a complete outsider

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.559
with no real right
to work on such a hard problem.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.059
But because of this doubt,

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.976
I surrounded myself
with neurosurgeons and clinicians,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.059
biochemists and bioengineers,

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:14.601
and we started to plan experiments.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.768
The basic idea is that we
would take an animal,

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:19.226
anesthetize it,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.726
expose its spinal cord

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.851
and sever it in the thoracic region,

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.559
rendering the animal a paraplegic.

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:27.976
We would then implant
an asparagus scaffold

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.059
between the severed
ends of the spinal cord
