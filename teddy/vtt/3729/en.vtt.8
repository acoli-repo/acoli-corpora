00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.309
and she can't lift herself up.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.851
Now I know how difficult
this video is to watch.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:10.518
My team struggled every day
with these types of experiments,

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:15.018
and we constantly asked ourselves
why we were doing this ...

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:18.292
until we started to observe
something extraordinary.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.934
This is an animal
that received an implant.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.559
Now she's not walking perfectly,

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.393
but she's moving those back legs

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.976
and she's even starting
to lift herself up.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.268
And on a treadmill,

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.309
you can see those legs moving
in a coordinated fashion.
