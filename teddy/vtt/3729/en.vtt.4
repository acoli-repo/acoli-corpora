00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:01.643
This is a really dumb idea.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.309
First of all, humans aren't plants.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.268
Our cells have not evolved
to grow on plant polymers,

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:11.559
and plant tissues have no business
being found in your spinal cord.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:12.851
And secondly,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.768
ideally these types of scaffolds
should disappear over time,

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.726
leaving behind natural, healthy tissue.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.684
But plant-based scaffolds don't do that,

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:23.601
because we lack the enzymes
to break them down.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:24.934
Funnily enough,

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.934
these properties were exactly why
we were having so much success.

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.351
Over the course of many experiments,
