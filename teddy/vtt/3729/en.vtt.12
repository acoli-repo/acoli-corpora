00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.476
we spend our lives
living on a knife's edge.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.768
On the one hand,

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:05.143
it's our job to fundamentally
broaden the horizons

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:06.476
of human knowledge,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.768
but at the same time,
we're trained to doubt --

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:11.559
to doubt our data,
to doubt our experiments,

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.476
to doubt our own conclusions.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.809
We spend our lives
crushed under the weight

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:22.059
of constant, unrelenting, never-ending
anxiety, uncertainty and self-doubt.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:25.351
And this is something
I really struggle with.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.643
But I think almost every
scientist can tell you

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:29.643
about the time they ignored those doubts

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.893
and did the experiment
that would never work.
