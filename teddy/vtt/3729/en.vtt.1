00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.351
and strip them of all their DNA
and their cells,

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.226
leaving behind natural fibers.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.018
And these fibers
could then be used as a scaffold

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.184
for reconstructing living tissue.

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:41.143
Now I know this is a little weird,

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.059
but in our very first
proof-of-concept experiment,

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:45.518
we took an apple,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.393
carved it into the shape of a human ear,

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:51.101
and then we took that ear-shaped scaffold,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.726
sterilized it, processed it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.893
and coaxed human cells
to grow inside of it.

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:58.643
We then took the next step
and implanted it,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.226
and we were able to demonstrate
