00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.059
between the severed
ends of the spinal cord

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.934
to act as a bridge.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.309
Now this is crucially important.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.601
We're only using asparagus.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.643
We're not adding stem cells
or electrical stimulation

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.018
or exoskeletons

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:42.351
or physical therapy

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:43.893
or pharmaceuticals.

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:45.434
We're simply investigating

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.434
if the microchannels in the scaffold alone

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.184
are enough to guide
the regeneration of neurons.

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:53.184
And here are the main results.

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:57.976
In this video, you can see an animal
about eight weeks after being paralyzed.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.976
You can see she can't move her back legs,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.309
and she can't lift herself up.
