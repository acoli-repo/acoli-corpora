00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:04.101
So I'm here today surrounded
by all these fruits and vegetables,

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.726
because these are the subjects
of my experiments.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.393
Now, bear with me for just a second,

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:11.851
but about a decade ago

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.601
my team started to rethink
how we make materials

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:19.351
for reconstructing
damaged or diseased human tissues,

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.143
and we made the totally
unexpected discovery

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.768
that plants could be used
for this purpose.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.643
In fact, we invented a way
to take these plants

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.351
and strip them of all their DNA
and their cells,
