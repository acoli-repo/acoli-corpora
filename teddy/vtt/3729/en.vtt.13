00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.893
and did the experiment
that would never work.

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:33.934
And the thing is, every now and then,

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.601
one of those experiments works out.

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:39.851
The challenge we face
is that while doubt can be destructive

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.476
to your mental health,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.268
it's also the reason why scientific rigor
is such a potent tool for discovery.

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:49.268
It forces us to ask
the difficult questions

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:50.976
and repeat experiments.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.101
Nothing about that is easy.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.143
And often it becomes our responsibility

00:06:56.167 --> 00:07:01.083
to bear the burden of the hard
and sometimes heart-wrenching experiment.
