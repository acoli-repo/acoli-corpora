00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.226
and we were able to demonstrate

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.601
that the scaffolds stimulated
the formation of blood vessels,

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.809
allowing the heart to keep them alive.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.893
So not too long after
these discoveries were taking place,

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:12.393
I was at home cooking
asparagus for dinner,

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:14.268
and after cutting the ends off,

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:18.768
I was noticing that the stalks were full
of these microchanneled vascular bundles.

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:20.101
And it really reminded me

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:24.542
of a whole body of bioengineering effort
aimed at treating spinal cord injury.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.726
Up to half a million people per year
suffer from this type of injury,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.601
and the symptoms can range
from pain and numbness
