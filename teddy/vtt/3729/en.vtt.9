you can see those legs moving
in a coordinated fashion.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.417
These are crucial signs of recovery.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.893
Now we still have a lot of work to do,

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:41.893
and there are a lot
of questions to answer,

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:45.268
but this is the first time
anyone has shown

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:49.583
that plant tissues can be used
to repair such a complex injury.

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:55.059
Even so, we've been sitting
on this data for over five years.

00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:59.476
Doubt drove us to repeat
these experiments again and again,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.184
to the point of almost bankrupting my lab.
