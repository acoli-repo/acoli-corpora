00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.351
So I'd like to show you a prototype

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.143
of one of our state-of-the-art
spinal cord implants.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.684
It's still made from asparagus

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.768
and contains all of those microchannels.

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.851
And you can see that it moves and bends

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.542
and has the same feel as human tissue.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.268
And you know,

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:48.809
I think the real innovation
is that we're now able to design

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:53.226
or program the architecture and structure
of plant tissues in such a way

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.934
that they could direct cell growth
to address an unmet medical need.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.226
As scientists,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.476
we spend our lives
living on a knife's edge.
