00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.601
and the symptoms can range
from pain and numbness

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.226
to devastating traumas

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.976
that lead to a complete loss
of motor function and independence.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.809
And in these forms of paralysis,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.851
there's no accepted treatment strategy,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.059
but one possible solution

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.476
might be the use of a scaffold
that has microchannels

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.143
which may guide regenerating neurons.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:55.726
So, could we use the asparagus
and its vascular bundles

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.018
to repair a spinal cord?

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:01.643
This is a really dumb idea.
