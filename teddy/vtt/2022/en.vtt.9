you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you've been listening to all that in the morning --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and, according to me, biases the result.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
