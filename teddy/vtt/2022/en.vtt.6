00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
To my surprise, it did not correlate.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --
