00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But it was quite obvious, quite clear,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that for this particular route that I had taken,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That seemed a little damning,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,
