00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we hired a car, looked up on Google,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
found a route into northern India from New Delhi

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
