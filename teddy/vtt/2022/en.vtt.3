00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which are socially and economically remote

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What happens to education in that context?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
do not have good enough teachers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They do not have good enough infrastructure.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And if they had some infrastructure,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
they have difficulty maintaining it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was
