00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
where most of the time they are told, don't do this,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So what does the eight-year-old do?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And if you tested him,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
he would answer every question correctly on that topic.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
