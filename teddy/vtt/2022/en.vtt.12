if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and he said something which completely solves this problem.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available
