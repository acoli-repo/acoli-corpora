would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach

And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?

Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,

I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,
