and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like, children would come and see what's happening over here.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
