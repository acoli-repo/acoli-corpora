00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
