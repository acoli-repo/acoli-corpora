00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So the principal looks at it and says,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that will be a completely different thing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,
