there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and came back three months later.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And as soon as they saw me they said,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
