00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
because all of you are talking about groups.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
if you lift the adult intervention.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Just a quick idea of the measurements.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But we got a clean learning curve,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I'll leave it at that,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
