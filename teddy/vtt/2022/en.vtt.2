Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that as you go further and further away

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What happens to education?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The second, or a different kind of remoteness

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which are socially and economically remote

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
