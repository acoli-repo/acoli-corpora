(Laughter)

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I was real surprised.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You know, how on earth did they know all this?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
-- mispronounced, but correct usage --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,
