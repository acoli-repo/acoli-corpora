00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
so that's not how it's happening.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And surrounding him are usually three other children,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
who are advising him on what they should do.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
who are also advising, usually wrongly,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
about everything that's going on on the computer.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
