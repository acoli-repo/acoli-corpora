00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They cut a hole inside that wall --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And this is what we saw.
