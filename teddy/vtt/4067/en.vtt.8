00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.558
which is, like, nothing in this game.

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.434
But it has this insanely earwormy tune,

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:06.140
which I'm not going to play to you,

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:08.172
because it will sear itself
into your brain

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:10.591
in the same way that
it seared itself into mine,

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:12.385
and I'm not going to do that to you.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.753
But like the surprise eggs,

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:15.941
it's got inside kids' heads

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.572
and addicted them to it.

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:20.127
So within a few years,
these finger family videos

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:21.454
start appearing everywhere,

00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:23.507
and you get versions
in different languages

00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:25.652
with popular kids' cartoons using food

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:28.226
or, frankly, using whatever kind
of animation elements

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.502
you seem to have lying around.
