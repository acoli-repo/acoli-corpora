00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:01.960
I'm James.

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.670
I'm a writer and artist,

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:06.035
and I make work about technology.

00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:10.365
I do things like draw life-size outlines
of military drones

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.217
in city streets around the world,

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.191
so that people can start to think
and get their heads around

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.655
these really quite hard-to-see
and hard-to-think-about technologies.

00:00:19.494 --> 00:00:23.330
I make things like neural networks
that predict the results of elections

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:25.091
based on weather reports,

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:26.429
because I'm intrigued about

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:30.377
what the actual possibilities
of these weird new technologies are.
