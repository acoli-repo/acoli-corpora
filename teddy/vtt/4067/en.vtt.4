00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:02.557
But the thing is, it's not adults
who are watching these videos.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.502
It's kids, small children.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:07.680
These videos are
like crack for little kids.

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:09.779
There's something about the repetition,

00:02:09.803 --> 00:02:12.271
the constant little
dopamine hit of the reveal,

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.161
that completely hooks them in.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.994
And little kids watch these videos
over and over and over again,

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:21.345
and they do it for hours
and hours and hours.

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.725
And if you try and take
the screen away from them,

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.531
they'll scream and scream and scream.

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:26.817
If you don't believe me --

00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.448
and I've already seen people
in the audience nodding --

00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:32.863
if you don't believe me, find someone
with small children and ask them,
