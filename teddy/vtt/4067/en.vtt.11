00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:31.491
between these things anymore?

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:36.363
And again, doesn't that uncertainty
feel kind of familiar right now?

00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:40.725
So the main way people get views
on their videos --

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.456
and remember, views mean money --

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.222
is that they stuff the titles
of these videos with these popular terms.

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.933
So you take, like, "surprise eggs"

00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:51.023
and then you add
"Paw Patrol," "Easter egg,"

00:05:51.047 --> 00:05:52.440
or whatever these things are,

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:55.357
all of these words from other
popular videos into your title,

00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:58.349
until you end up with this kind of
meaningless mash of language

00:05:58.373 --> 00:06:00.871
that doesn't make sense to humans at all.
