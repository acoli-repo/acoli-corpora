00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.986
that's happening across most
of our digital services,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.217
where it's impossible to know
where this information is coming from.

00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.070
It's basically fake news for kids,

00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:38.255
and we're training them from birth

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.785
to click on the very first link
that comes along,

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.762
regardless of what the source is.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.389
That's doesn't seem like
a terribly good idea.

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.109
Here's another thing
that's really big on kids' YouTube.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.061
This is called the "Finger Family Song."

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:53.103
I just heard someone groan
in the audience.

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:54.751
This is the "Finger Family Song."

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.705
This is the very first one I could find.

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.558
It's from 2007, and it only has
200,000 views,

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.558
which is, like, nothing in this game.
