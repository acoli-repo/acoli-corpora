00:04:56.898 --> 00:05:00.065
Because it's impossible to know
where these things are coming from.

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:01.330
Like, who is making them?

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:04.497
Some of them appear to be made
of teams of professional animators.

00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:07.403
Some of them are just randomly
assembled by software.

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:11.680
Some of them are quite wholesome-looking
young kids' entertainers.

00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:13.256
And some of them are from people

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.287
who really clearly
shouldn't be around children at all.

00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:17.926
(Laughter)

00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:23.627
And once again, this impossibility
of figuring out who's making this stuff --

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.807
like, this is a bot?

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:27.478
Is this a person? Is this a troll?

00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:29.884
What does it mean
that we can't tell the difference

00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:31.491
between these things anymore?
