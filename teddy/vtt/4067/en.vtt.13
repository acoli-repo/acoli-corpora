00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.188
there really are still people within
this algorithmically optimized system,

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:33.002
people who are kind
of increasingly forced to act out

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:36.092
these increasingly bizarre
combinations of words,

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:41.289
like a desperate improvisation artist
responding to the combined screams

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:43.516
of a million toddlers at once.

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:47.636
There are real people
trapped within these systems,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.715
and that's the other deeply strange thing
about this algorithmically driven culture,

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:53.120
because even if you're human,

00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:55.289
you have to end up behaving like a machine

00:06:55.313 --> 00:06:57.113
just to survive.

00:06:57.137 --> 00:06:59.237
And also, on the other side of the screen,

00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:02.208
there still are these little kids
watching this stuff,
