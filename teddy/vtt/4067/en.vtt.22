the first thing they said
they'd do about it

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:03.646
was that they'd deploy
better machine learning algorithms

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.999
to moderate the content.

00:11:05.023 --> 00:11:08.508
Well, machine learning,
as any expert in it will tell you,

00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:10.428
is basically what we've started to call

what's appropriate or not,

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:22.972
because we know what happens.

It'll start censoring other things.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:26.491
It'll start censoring queer content.

00:11:26.515 --> 00:11:28.752
It'll start censoring
