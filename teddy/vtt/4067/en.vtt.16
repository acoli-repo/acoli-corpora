WEBVTT

00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:00.870
with some live-action superhero stuff,

00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:04.150
you add in some weird,
trollish in-jokes or something,

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:07.540
and suddenly, you come
to a very weird place indeed.

00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:09.677
The stuff that tends to upset parents

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.032
is the stuff that has kind of violent
or sexual content, right?

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:15.878
Children's cartoons getting assaulted,

00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:17.920
getting killed,

00:08:17.944 --> 00:08:21.287
weird pranks that actually
genuinely terrify children.

00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.986
What you have is software pulling in
all of these different influences

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.971
to automatically generate
kids' worst nightmares.

00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:30.696
And this stuff really, really
does affect small children.
