00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:01.722
It's basically a video of someone
opening up loads of chocolate eggs

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:03.872
and showing the toys inside to the viewer.

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.110
That's it. That's all it does
for seven long minutes.

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.479
And I want you to notice
two things about this.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:14.577
First of all, this video
has 30 million views.

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:15.876
(Laughter)

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.542
And the other thing is,

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:21.435
it comes from a channel
that has 6.3 million subscribers,

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.139
that has a total of eight billion views,

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:27.269
and it's all just more videos like this --

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:32.164
30 million people watching a guy
opening up these eggs.
