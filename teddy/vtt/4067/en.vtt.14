00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:02.208
there still are these little kids
watching this stuff,

00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:06.438
stuck, their full attention grabbed
by these weird mechanisms.

00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:09.566
And most of these kids are too small
to even use a website.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.866
They're just kind of hammering
on the screen with their little hands.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.107
And so there's autoplay,

00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:17.710
where it just keeps playing these videos
over and over and over in a loop,

00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:19.793
endlessly for hours and hours at a time.

00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:22.660
And there's so much weirdness
in the system now

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:25.693
that autoplay takes you
to some pretty strange places.

00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:28.205
This is how, within a dozen steps,

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.387
you can go from a cute video
of a counting train
