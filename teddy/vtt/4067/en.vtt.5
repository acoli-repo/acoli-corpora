00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:32.863
if you don't believe me, find someone
with small children and ask them,

00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:35.227
and they'll know about
the surprise egg videos.

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.321
So this is where we start.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:40.987
It's 2018, and someone, or lots of people,

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.952
are using the same mechanism that, like,
Facebook and Instagram are using

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:46.965
to get you to keep checking that app,

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.974
and they're using it on YouTube
to hack the brains of very small children

00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:52.956
in return for advertising revenue.

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:56.347
At least, I hope
that's what they're doing.

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.326
I hope that's what they're doing it for,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.658
because there's easier ways
of making ad revenue on YouTube.
