00:12:29.555 --> 00:12:33.040
in these systems that we don't
really fully understand.

00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:36.135
Inequality of power
always leads to violence.

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:37.844
And we can see inside these systems

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:40.479
that inequality of understanding
does the same thing.

00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:44.282
If there's one thing that we can do
to start to improve these systems,

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:47.024
it's to make them more legible
to the people who use them,

00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:49.244
so that all of us have
a common understanding

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.119
of what's actually going on here.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.938
The thing, though, I think
most about these systems

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:58.819
is that this isn't, as I hope
I've explained, really about YouTube.

00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:00.155
It's about everything.
