30 million people watching a guy
opening up these eggs.

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:36.669
It sounds pretty weird, but if you search
for "surprise eggs" on YouTube,

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:40.216
it'll tell you there's
10 million of these videos,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.897
and I think that's an undercount.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.818
I think there's way, way more of these.

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:46.084
If you keep searching, they're endless.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:48.267
There's millions and millions
of these videos

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.745
in increasingly baroque combinations
of brands and materials,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:55.615
and there's more and more of them
being uploaded every single day.

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.150
Like, this is a strange world. Right?

00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:02.557
But the thing is, it's not adults
who are watching these videos.
