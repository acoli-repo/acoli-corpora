00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.303
that we should be basing
our society and culture upon,

00:10:31.327 --> 00:10:33.487
and the way in which
we should be funding it.

00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:37.030
And the other thing that's kind of
the major driver of this is automation,

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:39.383
which is the deployment
of all of this technology

00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:41.928
as soon as it arrives,
without any kind of oversight,

00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:43.364
and then once it's out there,

00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:47.231
kind of throwing up our hands and going,
"Hey, it's not us, it's the technology."

00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:48.897
Like, "We're not involved in it."

00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:50.688
That's not really good enough,

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:53.422
because this stuff isn't
just algorithmically governed,

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:55.944
it's also algorithmically policed.

00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:58.816
When YouTube first started
to pay attention to this,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.927
the first thing they said
they'd do about it
