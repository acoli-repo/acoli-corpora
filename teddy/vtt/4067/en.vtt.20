00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.198
and the first of those is advertising,

00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.059
which is the monetization of attention

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:07.219
without any real other variables at work,

00:10:07.243 --> 00:10:11.128
any care for the people who are
actually developing this content,

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.788
the centralization of the power,
the separation of those things.

00:10:14.812 --> 00:10:17.956
And I think however you feel
about the use of advertising

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.218
to kind of support stuff,

00:10:19.242 --> 00:10:22.309
the sight of grown men in diapers
rolling around in the sand

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.316
in the hope that an algorithm
that they don't really understand

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.655
will give them money for it

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.716
suggests that this
probably isn't the thing

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.303
that we should be basing
our society and culture upon,
