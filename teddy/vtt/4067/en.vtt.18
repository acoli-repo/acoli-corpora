00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:01.882
We've taken all of this influence,
all of these things,

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:04.859
and munged them together in a way
that no one really intended.

00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:08.039
And yet, this is also the way
that we're building the entire world.

00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:09.836
We're taking all of this data,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.307
a lot of it bad data,

00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:14.360
a lot of historical data
full of prejudice,

00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:17.221
full of all of our worst
impulses of history,

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:19.294
and we're building that
into huge data sets

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:20.741
and then we're automating it.

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:24.267
And we're munging it together
into things like credit reports,

00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:25.925
into insurance premiums,

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:28.642
into things like predictive
policing systems,

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:30.428
into sentencing guidelines.
