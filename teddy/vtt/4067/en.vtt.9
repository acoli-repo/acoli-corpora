00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.502
you seem to have lying around.

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:36.199
And once again, there are millions
and millions and millions of these videos

00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:39.658
available online in all of these
kind of insane combinations.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:41.910
And the more time
you start to spend with them,

00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:45.628
the crazier and crazier
you start to feel that you might be.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:48.985
And that's where I
kind of launched into this,

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.675
that feeling of deep strangeness
and deep lack of understanding

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.874
of how this thing was constructed
that seems to be presented around me.

00:04:56.898 --> 00:05:00.065
Because it's impossible to know
where these things are coming from.
