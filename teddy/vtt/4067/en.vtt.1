00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:30.377
what the actual possibilities
of these weird new technologies are.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.831
Last year, I built
my own self-driving car.

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:36.381
But because I don't
really trust technology,

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.333
I also designed a trap for it.

00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:39.863
(Laughter)

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:44.185
And I do these things mostly because
I find them completely fascinating,

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:46.811
but also because I think
when we talk about technology,

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.454
we're largely talking about ourselves

00:00:49.478 --> 00:00:51.777
and the way that we understand the world.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.243
So here's a story about technology.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.350
This is a "surprise egg" video.

00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:01.722
It's basically a video of someone
opening up loads of chocolate eggs
