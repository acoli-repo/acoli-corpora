00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:01.332
it's actually in itself
a piece of education

00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:05.118
that allows you to start seeing
how complex systems come together and work

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:08.643
and maybe be able to apply
that knowledge elsewhere in the world.

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.782
HW: James, it's such
an important discussion,

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:14.033
and I know many people here
are really open and prepared to have it,

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:15.916
so thanks for starting off our morning.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.340
JB: Thanks very much. Cheers.

00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:19.015
