Welcome to Thailand.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the country was very, very poor

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We decided to do something about it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but we didn't begin with a welfare program

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or a poverty reduction program.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But we began with a family-planning program,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
following a very successful

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
maternal child health activity,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
sets of activities.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So basically, no one would accept family planning
