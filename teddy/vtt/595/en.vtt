00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.643
Do you think the things we build today

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.833
will be considered wonders in the future?

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.684
Think of Stonehenge,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.226
the Pyramids,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.917
Machu Picchu and Easter Island.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.083
Now, they're all pretty different
from what we're doing today,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.768
with those massive stones,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:24.917
assembled in complex
but seemingly illogical ways,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.934
and all traces of their construction

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.601
erased,
