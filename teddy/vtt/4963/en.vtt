00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:07.791
In 1925,

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.831
Frida Kahlo was on her way home 
from school in Mexico City

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.911
when the bus she was riding 
collided with a streetcar.

00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:18.011
She suffered near-fatal injuries 
to her spine, pelvis and hips,

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:20.561
and was bedridden for months afterward.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.731
During her recovery,

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.051
she had a special easel 
attached to her bed

00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.181
so she could practice 
painting techniques.

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:27.431
When she set to work,

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.691
she began to paint the world according 
to her own singular vision.
