00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:30.715
of disability in her work;

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.255
painting herself in agony,

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.155
recuperating from operations,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.215
or including objects such as her back
brace and wheelchair.

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:41.476
Meanwhile, her relationship with Rivera
was tempestuous,

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:44.176
marked by infidelity on both sides.

00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:46.226
At one point they even divorced,

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:48.046
then remarried a year later.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:49.096
During this period,

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:52.226
she painted the double self-portrait 
"The Two Fridas,"

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:56.416
which speaks to the anguish of loss 
and a splintered sense of self.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.671
The Frida to the left has a broken heart,

00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:02.331
which drips blood onto her 
old-fashioned Victorian dress.
