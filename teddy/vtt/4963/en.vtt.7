Kahlo died in 1954 at the age of 47.

00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:31.750
In the years after her death,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.800
she experienced a surge in popularity 
that has lasted to this day.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.850
And although her image has proliferated,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.170
Kahlo’s body of work

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.367
reminds us that there are no simple truths

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:46.037
about the life, work and legacy of the 
woman behind the icon.

00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:49.725
Rather, she put multiple versions of 
her reality on display–

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:53.725
and provided us with a few entry-ways 
into the contents of her soul.
