00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.691
she began to paint the world according 
to her own singular vision.

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.030
Over the course of her life,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.780
she would establish herself as the creator
and muse behind extraordinary art.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.127
Though you may have met 
Kahlo's gaze before,

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:45.437
her work provides an opportunity 
to see the world through her eyes.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.177
She painted friends and family,

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:49.597
still lives and spiritual scenes;

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:51.737
but it was her mesmerizing self-portraits

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:54.127
which first caught the world’s attention.

00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:55.147
In an early work,

00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:57.507
"Self Portrait with Velvet Dress,"

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:03.257
the focus is on her strong brows, facial 
hair, long neck and formidable stare.
