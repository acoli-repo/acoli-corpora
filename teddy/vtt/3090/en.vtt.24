00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.776
And then there's a little bit
back and forth in the end:

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.376
"I don't like that they have access
to everything I do,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.976
but I still think
it's worth it in the long run."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.536
So, if you didn't know that this person

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.816
just took part in
a choice blindness experiment,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.696
I don't think you would question

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.840
that this is the true attitude
of that person.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.656
And what happens in the end,
with the voting intention?

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.376
What we find -- that one is also
clearly affected by the questionnaire.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.136
So we have 10 participants

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.136
shifting from left to right
or from right to left.
