00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.616
So what we find first of all here,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.856
is that very few of these
manipulations are detected.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.536
And they're not detected
in the sense that they realize,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.416
"OK, you must have changed my answer,"

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.696
it was more the case that,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.896
"OK, I must've misunderstood
the question the first time I read it.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.160
Can I please change it?"

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.216
And even if a few of these
manipulations were changed,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.376
the overall majority was missed.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.056
So we managed to switch 90 percent
of the participants' answers

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.240
from left to right, right to left,
their overall profile.
