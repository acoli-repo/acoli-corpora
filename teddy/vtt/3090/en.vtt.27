00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.600
OK.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.416
So what does it all mean?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.856
What do I think is going on here?

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.096
So first of all,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.976
a lot of what we call self-knowledge
is actually self-interpretation.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.496
So I see myself make a choice,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.296
and then when I'm asked why,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.856
I just try to make
as much sense of it as possible

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.816
when I make an explanation.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.856
But we do this so quickly
and with such ease

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.160
that we think we actually know the answer
when we answer why.
