00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.136
Woman 2: No.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.416
Woman 2: I did not notice.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.376
(Laughs)

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.616
PJ: Thank you.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.016
Woman 2: Thank you.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.096
PJ: OK, so as you probably
figured out now,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.376
the trick is that I have
two cards in each hand,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.976
and when I hand one of them over,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.360
the black one kind of disappears
into the black surface on the table.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.376
So using pictures like this,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.776
normally not more than 20 percent
of the participants detect these tries.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.216
And as you saw in the movie,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.416
when in the end
we explain what's going on,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.816
they're very surprised and often refuse
to believe the trick has been made.
