00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.000
so he would lean to the left, basically.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.240
And in the end, we also had them
fill in their voting intention once more.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.440
But of course, there was
also a trick involved.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.536
So first, we walked up to people,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.616
we asked them
about their voting intention

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.896
and then when they started filling in,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.376
we would fill in a set of answers
going in the opposite direction.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.976
We would put it under the notepad.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.776
And when we get the questionnaire,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.120
we would simply glue it on top
of the participant's own answer.
