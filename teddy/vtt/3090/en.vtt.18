00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.336
Then we asked them
to answer 12 of these questions.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.336
They would fill in their answers,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.976
and we would ask them to discuss,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.496
so OK, why do you think
tax on gas should be increased?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.616
And we'd go through the questions.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.536
Then we had a color coded template

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.496
that would allow us
to tally their overall score.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.976
So this person would have
one, two, three, four

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.296
five, six, seven, eight, nine
scores to the left,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.000
so he would lean to the left, basically.
