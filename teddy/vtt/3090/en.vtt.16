00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.896
So in Sweden, the political landscape

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.280
is dominated by a left-wing
and a right-wing coalition.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.136
And the voters may move a little bit
between the parties within each coalition,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.920
but there is very little movement
between the coalitions.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.656
And before each elections,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.896
the newspapers and the polling institutes

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.536
put together what they call
"an election compass"

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.896
which consists of a number
of dividing issues

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.256
that sort of separates the two coalitions.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.015
Things like if tax on gasoline
should be increased
