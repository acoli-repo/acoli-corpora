that would actually consider
shifting their attitudes.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.136
And here I must point out, of course,
that you are not allowed to use this

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.776
as an actual method
to change people's votes

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.296
before an election,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.936
and we clearly debriefed them afterwards

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.256
and gave them every
opportunity to change back

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.760
to whatever they thought first.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.936
But what this shows is
that if you can get people

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.496
to see the opposite view and engage
in a conversation with themselves,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.440
that could actually make them
change their views.
