00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.416
So this is a clear example
of a post hoc construction.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.240
So they just explained
the choice afterwards.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.616
So what this experiment shows is,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.296
OK, so if we fail to detect
that our choices have been changed,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.520
we will immediately start
to explain them in another way.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.776
And what we also found

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.016
is that the participants
often come to prefer the alternative,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.296
that they were led to believe they liked.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.336
So if we let them do the choice again,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.120
they will now choose the face
they had previously rejected.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.816
So this is the effect
we call "choice blindness."
