00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.056
where we try to match what they say
with the actual faces.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.960
And then we find things like this.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.816
So here, this male participant,
he preferred the girl to the left,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.696
he ended up with the one to the right.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.536
And then, he explained
his choice like this.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.856
"She is radiant.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.976
I would rather have approached her
at the bar than the other one.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.616
And I like earrings."

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.136
And whatever made him choose
the girl on the left to begin with,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.736
it can't have been the earrings,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.616
because they were actually
sitting on the girl on the right.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.416
So this is a clear example
of a post hoc construction.
