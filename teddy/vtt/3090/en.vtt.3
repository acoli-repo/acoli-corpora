00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.456
with a group of Swedish magicians,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.122
and they helped us create a method

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:36.120
in which we would be able to manipulate
the outcome of people's choices.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.696
This way we would know
when people are wrong about themselves,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.760
even if they don't know this themselves.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.136
So I will now show you
a short movie showing this manipulation.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.576
So it's quite simple.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.736
The participants make a choice,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.016
but I end up giving them the opposite.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.560
And then we want to see:
How did they react, and what did they say?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.400
So it's quite simple, but see
if you can spot the magic going on.
