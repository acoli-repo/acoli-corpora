00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.856
(Laughter)

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.080
Woman 3: This one.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.680
PJ: What made you choose him?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.416
Woman 3: I don't know,
he looks a little bit like the Hobbit.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.496
(Laughter)

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.016
PJ: And what happens in the end

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.136
when I tell them the true nature
of the experiment?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.616
Yeah, that's it. I just have to
ask a few questions.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.856
Man: Sure.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.856
PJ: What did you think
of this experiment, was it easy or hard?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.120
Man: It was easy.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.376
PJ: During the experiments,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.736
I actually switched
the pictures three times.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.336
Was this anything you noticed?
