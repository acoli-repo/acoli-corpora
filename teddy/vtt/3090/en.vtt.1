00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.456
So when you say that you prefer
George Clooney to Tom Hanks,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.536
due to his concern for the environment,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.760
is that really true?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.056
So you can be perfectly sincere
and genuinely believe

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.016
that this is the reason
that drives your choice,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.640
but to me, it may still feel
like something is missing.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.736
As it stands, due to
the nature of subjectivity,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.080
it is actually very hard to ever prove
that people are wrong about themselves.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.736
So I'm an experimental psychologist,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.296
and this is the problem
we've been trying to solve in our lab.
