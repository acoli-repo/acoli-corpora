00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.136
shifting from left to right
or from right to left.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.696
We have another 19
that go from clear voting intention

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.176
to being uncertain.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.296
Some go from being uncertain
to clear voting intention.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.056
And then there is a number of participants
staying uncertain throughout.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.656
And that number is interesting

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.296
because if you look
at what the polling institutes say

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.976
the closer you get to an election,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.136
the only people that are sort of in play

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.816
are the ones that are
considered uncertain.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.056
But we show there is a much larger number

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.880
that would actually consider
shifting their attitudes.
