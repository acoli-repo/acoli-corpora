00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.296
and this is the problem
we've been trying to solve in our lab.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.496
So we wanted to create an experiment

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.056
that would allow us to challenge
what people say about themselves,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.760
regardless of how certain they may seem.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.696
But tricking people

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.096
So we turned to the professionals.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.320

the illusion of a free choice.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.336
So when they say, "Pick a card, any card,"

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.280
the only thing you know
is that your choice is no longer free.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.576
So we had a few fantastic
brainstorming sessions

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.456
with a group of Swedish magicians,
