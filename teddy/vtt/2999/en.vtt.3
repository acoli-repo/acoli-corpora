00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:31.109
as they had when they began the shift
of getting people to sign petitions,

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.077
or often they had more energy,

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.602
and they'd be really excited about
going to watch the bands in the evening

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:37.800
and having a dance.

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:39.935
And even if I loved the bands,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.094
all I wanted to do was to go back
to my tent and have a sleep,

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:45.785
because I'd just feel
completely wiped out,

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.366
and I was really jealous of people
that had the energy

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.920
to go and party hard at the festivals.

00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:54.615
But it also made me really angry,
as well, inside.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.561
I thought, "This isn't fair,
I'm an introvert,

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:02.505
and all of the offline campaigning
seems to be favoring extroverts."
