00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:01.638
but I did it because I cared,

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:05.567
but I would hide in the toilets,
because I'd be exhausted,

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.536
and I didn't want my teammates
doubting my commitment to the cause,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.441
thinking that I was slacking.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:13.608
And we'd go and meet
at the end of our shift,

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:15.997
and we'd count how many petitions
had been signed,

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:18.688
and often I'd win the amount
of petitions signed

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.251
even though I had
my little breaks in the toilet.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.022
But I was always very jealous
of the other activists,

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:26.410
because either they had
the same amount of energy

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:31.109
as they had when they began the shift
of getting people to sign petitions,
