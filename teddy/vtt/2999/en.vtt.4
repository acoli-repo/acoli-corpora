and all of the offline campaigning
seems to be favoring extroverts."

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:05.232
I would go on marches which drained me.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:06.518
That was the other option.

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:10.943
Or I'd go and join campaigns
outside embassies or shops.

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:13.912
The only thing that was on offer
was around lots of people,

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:15.888
it was very loud activism,

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:18.935
it always involved lots of people,

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:23.857
and I not only thought
that that wasn't fair,

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.707
because a third to a half
of the world's population are introverts,

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.746
which isn't fair on them,
because we burn out,
