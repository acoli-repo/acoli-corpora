00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:01.562
because it's the only job
I can do, really --

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:03.301
I was campaigning at university,

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:06.357
and for the last 10 years,
I've been a professional campaigner

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:07.548
for large charities,

00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:11.421
and now I'm a creative campaigner
consultant for different charities

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.709
as well as other work I do --

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:16.945
but I knew that there were other forms
of activism that were needed.

00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:20.163
I started tinkering about seven years ago

00:03:20.187 --> 00:03:23.941
to see what quieter forms of activism
I could engage with

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.242
so I didn't burn out as an activist,

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:31.028
but also to look at some of the issues
I was concerned about in campaigning.
