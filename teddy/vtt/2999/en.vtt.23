00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.712
Climate change is going to affect it,

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:35.183
and I think there's lot of other things
that climate change will affect,

00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:38.750
and I really want to make sure I'm part
of the solution, not the problem."

00:11:38.774 --> 00:11:42.353
And then we deflect, because we don't
like to be the center of attention,

00:11:42.377 --> 00:11:45.504
and say, "What do you love
and how will climate change affect it?"

00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:48.834
Or it might be shop-dropping
instead of shop-lifting,

00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:52.715
where we'll make little mini-scrolls
with lovely stories on

00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:55.097
about what's the story
behind your clothes.

00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:59.097
Is it a joyful story of how it's made,
or is it a torturous one?

00:11:59.121 --> 00:12:01.918
And we'll just drop them
in little pockets in shops,
