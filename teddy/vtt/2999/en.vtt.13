00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.641
to be heard and to feel
part of that movement for change,

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:32.816
in a good way.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.222
Some ways we do it is stitch cards

00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:38.309
about what values we thread
through our activism,

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.841
and making sure that we don't
just react in unethical ways.

00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:44.675
One, sometimes we work
with art institutions

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.771
where we will get
over 150 people at the V&amp;A

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:49.245
who can come for hours,

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.706
sit and stitch together
on a particular issue,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.191
and then tweet what they're thinking
or how it went, like this one.

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:58.950
Also, I always think
that activism needs introverts

00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:01.989
because we're really good
at intimate activism.
