often we do the wrong things.

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:34.805
I use craft, like needlework --

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.908
like this guy behind me is doing --

00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:40.766
as a way to not only slow down
those extrovert doers,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.548
but also to bring in nervous,
quiet introverts into activism.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.727
By doing repetitive actions,

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.765
like handicraft, you can't do it fast,
you have to do it slowly.

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.500
And those repetitive stitches

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:58.588
help you meditate on the big,
complex, messy social change issues

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:00.960
and figure out what we can do
