and not being gentle in our protest,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.257
they wouldn't have even listened to us,

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.308
never mind had those discussions with us.

00:09:35.332 --> 00:09:38.690
And I think introverts

not to be conflicting
with them all the time.

00:09:56.632 --> 00:10:01.326
The third way I think activists
are really missing out
