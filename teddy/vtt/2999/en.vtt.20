The third way I think activists
are really missing out

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.220
if they don't engage introverts

00:10:03.244 --> 00:10:08.275
is that introverts, like I said,
can be half of the world's population,

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:11.403
and most of us won't say
that we're introvert,

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:14.621
or we get embarrassed
by saying what overwhelms us.

00:10:14.645 --> 00:10:16.646
So for me, a few years ago,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.763
my mom used to send me
texts in capital letters --

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:22.937
and she can now do emojis
and everything, she's fine --

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:24.740
but as soon as I'd see this text,

00:10:24.764 --> 00:10:28.384
I'd wince and think, "Ooh,
it's capital letters, it's too much."

00:10:28.408 --> 00:10:31.590
And I'd have to ignore it to read
the lovely text she sent me.
