00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.115
everyone's on the scale
in different places --

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.893
because it's a quiet,
slow form of activism,

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:39.687
it really helps introverts be heard

00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:43.579
in other areas, where
they are often not heard.

00:05:43.603 --> 00:05:46.253
It sounds odd,

00:05:46.277 --> 00:05:49.905
but while you're stitching,
you don't need eye contact with people.

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:52.041
So, for nervous introverts,

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:56.255
it means that you can stitch away
next to someone or a group of people

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.478
and ask questions that you're thinking

00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:01.565
that often you don't
get time to ask people,
