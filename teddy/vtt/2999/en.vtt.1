"What am I doing?
I don't even need the toilet."

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.316
But the reason I went

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.776
was because I was volunteering
for a large charity on climate justice,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.708
and it was seven years ago,

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:41.223
when lots of people didn't believe
in climate change,

00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:43.152
people were very cynical about activism,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.034
and my role, with all of my teammates,

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:48.059
was to get people to sign petitions
on climate justice

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:50.637
and educate them
a bit more about the issue.

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:54.558
And I cared deeply about climate change
and lots of inequality,

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:56.535
so I'd go and I'd talk to lots of people,

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.789
which made me nervous
and drained me of energy,

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:01.638
but I did it because I cared,
