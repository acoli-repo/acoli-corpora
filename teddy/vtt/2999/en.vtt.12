00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:01.565
that often you don't
get time to ask people,

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:04.486
or you're too nervous to ask
if you give them eye contact.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.462
So you can get introverts,
who are those big, deep thinkers,

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:10.653
saying, "That's really interesting
that you want to do

00:06:10.677 --> 00:06:13.893
that extrovert form of activism
that's about shaming people

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:15.608
or quickly going out somewhere,

00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:17.806
but who are you trying to target and how,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.759
and is that the best way to do it?"

00:06:19.783 --> 00:06:22.830
So it means you could have
these discussions in a very slow way,

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.831
which is great for the extrovert
to slow down and think deeply,

00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:28.062
but it's really good
for the introvert as well,

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.641
to be heard and to feel
part of that movement for change,
