A few years ago, about seven years ago,

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:06.535
I found myself hiding
in a festival toilet,

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.358
a music festival toilet,

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:11.509
and if anyone's been to a music festival,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.454
yeah, you'll know that by the third day,

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:17.167
it's pretty nasty.

00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.477
I was standing in the toilet
because I couldn't even sit down,

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.184
because the toilet roll had run out,

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:24.652
there was mud everywhere,

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:26.101
and it smelled pretty bad.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.902
And I stood there thinking,

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:30.934
"What am I doing?
I don't even need the toilet."
