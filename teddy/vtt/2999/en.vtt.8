00:03:57.096 --> 00:04:00.889
then our activism
should be beautiful, kind and just,

00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:02.278
and often it's not.

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:05.063
And today, I just want to talk
about three ways

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:07.158
that I think activism needs introverts.

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:11.081
I think there's lot of other ways,
but I'm just going to talk about three.

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:15.747
And the first one is:
activism is often very quick,

00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:17.081
and it's about doing,

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:20.360
so extroverts, often their immediate
response to injustice is,

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:21.844
we've got to do stuff now,

00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:23.678
we've got to react really quickly --

00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:25.317
and yes, we do need to react,

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:27.937
but we need to be strategic
in our campaigning,

00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:29.587
and if we just act on anger,

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:31.285
often we do the wrong things.
