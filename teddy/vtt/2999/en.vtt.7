00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:31.028
but also to look at some of the issues
I was concerned about in campaigning.

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:34.482
I was very lucky that, when I worked
for Oxfam and other big charities,

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.704
I could read lots of big reports

00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:39.982
on what influenced
politicians and businesses

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:41.697
and the general public,

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.199
what campaigns worked really well,
which ones didn't.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.158
And I'm a bit of a geek,
so I look at all of that stuff,

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:48.564
and I wanted to tinker around

00:03:48.588 --> 00:03:52.453
to see how I could engage people
in social change in a different way,

00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:57.072
because I think if we want the world
to be more beautiful, kind and just,

00:03:57.096 --> 00:04:00.889
then our activism
should be beautiful, kind and just,
