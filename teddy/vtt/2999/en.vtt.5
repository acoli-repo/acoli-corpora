00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.746
which isn't fair on them,
because we burn out,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.327
or we'd be put off
by activism and not do it,

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.106
and everyone needs to be
an activist in this world.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:41.056
And also, I didn't think
it was particularly clever,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.811
but I could see that a lot
of the activism that worked

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:47.082
wasn't only extrovert activism.

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:48.851
It wasn't only the loud stuff.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.764
It wasn't about people
performing all the time.

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:54.409
A lot of the work that was needed
was in the background,

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.375
was hidden, wasn't seen.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.419
And when I ended up
just being a campaigner,

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:01.562
because it's the only job
I can do, really --
