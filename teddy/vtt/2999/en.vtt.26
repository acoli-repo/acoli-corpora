WEBVTT

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:01.045
And we're good at intriguing people

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:05.779
by doing strange little things that help
create conversations and thought.

00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:08.999
Introverts, my call to action for you is,

00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:10.801
I know you like being on your own,

00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:12.676
I know you like being in your head,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.597
but activism needs you,

00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.653
so sometimes you've got to get out there.

00:13:16.677 --> 00:13:20.011
It doesn't mean that you've got
to turn into an extrovert and burn out,

00:13:20.035 --> 00:13:21.607
because that's no use for anyone,

00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:22.828
but what it does mean

00:13:22.852 --> 00:13:26.796
is that you should value the skills
and the traits that you have

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.272
that activism needs.

00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:30.399
So for everyone in this room,
