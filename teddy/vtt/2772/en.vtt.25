Word got around that she was the daughter
the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.

[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco
her father is a SA mining billionaire.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.422
She's not sorry.
And neither is her father.]

00:12:40.446 --> 00:12:42.269
I thought that was true about Justine,

00:12:42.293 --> 00:12:45.631
until I met her at a bar, and I asked her
about her billionaire father,

00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:47.568
and she said, "My father sells carpets."

00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:49.749

the early days of Twitter,

00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:52.503

shameful secrets about themselves,

00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:55.453
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:59.650
These days, the hunt is on
for people's shameful secrets.

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:01.716
