And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,
got on the plane, got no replies,

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:07.085
turned off her phone, fell asleep,

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.098
woke up 11 hours later,

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.716
turned on her phone while the plane
was taxiing on the runway,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.097
and straightaway there was
a message from somebody

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.217
that she hadn't spoken
to since high school,

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.988
that said, "I am so sorry
to see what's happening to you."

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.793
And then another message
from a best friend,

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:27.831
"You need to call me right now.

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:31.868
You are the worldwide number one
trending topic on Twitter."
