We could hit them with a weapon

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:36.496

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.943
When powerful people
misused their privilege,

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.630
we were going to get them.

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.092
This was like the
democratization of justice.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.519
Hierarchies were being leveled out.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.541

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:58.123

and faking quotes,

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.879
and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.
