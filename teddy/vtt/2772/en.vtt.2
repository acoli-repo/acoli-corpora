00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.879
and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.

00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:03.394
And he had the opportunity

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:07.248
to publicly apologize
at a foundation lunch.

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:10.203
This was going to be the most
important speech of his life.

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.511
Maybe it would win him some salvation.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.443
He knew before he arrived

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.546
that the foundation was going to be
live-streaming his event,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.594
but what he didn't know
until he turned up,

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:24.546
was that they'd erected a giant screen
Twitter feed right next to his head.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.062
(Laughter)

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.629
Another one in a monitor screen
in his eye line.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:32.089
I don't think the foundation did this
because they were monstrous.
