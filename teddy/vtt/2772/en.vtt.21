I think some people were genuinely upset,

00:10:30.858 --> 00:10:32.286
but I think for other people,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.333
it's because Twitter is basically
a mutual approval machine.

00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:38.276
We surround ourselves with people
who feel the same way we do,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.563
and we approve each other,

00:10:39.587 --> 00:10:41.238
and that's a really good feeling.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.910
And if somebody gets in the way,
we screen them out.

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.021
And do you know what
that's the opposite of?

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.786
It's the opposite of democracy.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:52.333
We wanted to show that we cared
about people dying of AIDS in Africa.

00:10:52.357 --> 00:10:56.364
Our desire to be seen to be compassionate
is what led us to commit

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:59.433
this profoundly un-compassionate act.

00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:02.417
