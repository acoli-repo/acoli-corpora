a fury of Tweets saying,

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:36.960

a privileged bitch, too."

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:39.220
And so to her shame, she wrote,

00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:43.776
she shut up and watched
as Justine's life got torn apart.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.506
It started to get darker:

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.440
[Everyone go report
this cunt @JustineSacco]

in the new year. #GettingFired]

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.705
Thousands of people around the world

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.256
decided it was their duty
to get her fired.
