00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.902
And that's when the anger
turned to excitement:

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:04.548
[All I want for Christmas is to see
@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands

00:09:04.572 --> 00:09:06.573
and she checks
her inbox/voicemail. #fired]

00:09:06.597 --> 00:09:09.288
[Oh man, @justinesacco
is going to have the most painful

00:09:09.312 --> 00:09:11.711
phone-turning-on moment ever
when her plane lands.]

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:15.151
[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco
bitch get fired. In REAL time.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:17.199
Before she even KNOWS
she's getting fired.]

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.236
What we had was
a delightful narrative arc.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.085
We knew something that Justine didn't.

00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:23.450
Can you think of anything
less judicial than this?

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.351
Justine was asleep on a plane
and unable to explain herself,

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.938
and her inability was
a huge part of the hilarity.
