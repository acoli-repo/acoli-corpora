00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:31.686
where everybody's either
a magnificent hero

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.318
or a sickening villain,

00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:36.359
even though we know that's not true
about our fellow humans.

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:40.369
What's true is that
we are clever and stupid;

00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:43.579
what's true is that we're grey areas.

00:13:43.603 --> 00:13:46.481
The great thing about social media
was how it gave a voice

00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:47.901
to voiceless people,

00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:50.579
but we're now creating
a surveillance society,

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:54.953
where the smartest way to survive
is to go back to being voiceless.

00:13:55.423 --> 00:13:56.856
Let's not do that.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.032
Thank you.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:03.774
(Applause)
