I don't think the foundation did this
because they were monstrous.

00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:35.267
I think they were clueless:
I think this was a unique moment

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.828
when the beautiful naivety of Twitter

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:41.161
was hitting the increasingly
horrific reality.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:45.160
And here were some of the Tweets
that were cascading into his eye line,

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:46.910
as he was trying to apologize:

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.196
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us
into forgiving him."

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.295
(Laughter)

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.787
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven
that he is capable of feeling shame."

00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.280
That one must have been written
by the best psychiatrist ever,
