You know, when we watch
courtroom dramas, we tend to identify

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.480
with the kindhearted defense attorney,

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:39.010
but give us the power,
and we become like hanging judges.

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:41.819
Power shifts fast.

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:46.780
We were getting Jonah because he was
perceived to have misused his privilege,

00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:50.087
but Jonah was on the floor then,
and we were still kicking,

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.893
and congratulating ourselves
for punching up.

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.933
And it began to feel weird and empty
when there wasn't a powerful person

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:00.975
who had misused their privilege
that we could get.
