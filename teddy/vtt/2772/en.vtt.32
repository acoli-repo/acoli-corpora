As soon as I say, "We are the powerful
people abusing our power now,"

00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:03.076
I get people saying,
"Well you must be a racist too."

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.775
BG: So the other night --
yesterday -- we were at dinner,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.714
and there were two discussions going on.

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:10.786
On one side you were talking
with people around the table --

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.973
and that was a nice,
constructive discussion.

00:16:12.997 --> 00:16:15.344
On the other, every time
you turned to your phone,

00:16:15.368 --> 00:16:16.929
there is this deluge of insults.

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:20.344
JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
We had like a TED dinner last night.

00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:24.168
We were chatting and it was lovely
and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.312
Somebody said, "You are
a white supremacist."

00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:29.310
And then I went back and had
a nice conversation with somebody,

00:16:29.334 --> 00:16:30.875
and then I went back to Twitter,
