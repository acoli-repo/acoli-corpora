Did Justine's joke overwhelm
your Twitter feed the way it did mine?

00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:33.449
It did mine, and I thought
what everybody thought that night,

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.561
which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.925
Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.257
And I sat up in my bed,

00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:43.205
and I put the pillow behind my head,

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.476
and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure
that joke was intended to be racist.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.262
Maybe instead of gleefully
flaunting her privilege,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.886
she was mocking the gleeful
flaunting of privilege.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.723
There's a comedy tradition of this,

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:59.435
like South Park or Colbert
or Randy Newman.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.904
Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being
as good at it as Randy Newman.
