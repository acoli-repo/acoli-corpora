On Twitter that night, we were
like toddlers crawling towards a gun.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.794
Somebody worked out exactly
which plane she was on, so they linked

00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.917
to a flight tracker website.

00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:44.053
[British Airways Flight 43
On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]

00:09:44.077 --> 00:09:46.532
A hashtag began trending worldwide:

00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:49.158
# hasJustineLandedYet?

00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:51.348
[It is kinda wild
to see someone self-destruct

00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:54.095
without them even being aware of it.
#hasJustineLandedYet]

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:57.513
[Seriously. I just want to go home
to go to bed, but everyone at the bar

00:09:57.537 --> 00:10:00.497
is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.
Can't look away. Can't leave.]
