00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.881
Well, this is a really
extraordinary honor for me.

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:08.571
I spend most of my time in jails,
in prisons, on death row.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.199
I spend most of my time
in very low-income communities,

00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:14.936
in the projects and places where
there's a great deal of hopelessness.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.512
And being here at TED
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:20.330
has been very, very energizing to me.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.267
And one of the things that's emerged
in my short time here

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:25.285
is that TED has an identity.

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:30.715
And you can actually say things here
that have impacts around the world.
