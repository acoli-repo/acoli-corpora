00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I found that I would have to build them myself.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I did just that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I tested them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I found that industrial productivity

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
can be achieved on a small scale.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So then I published the 3D designs,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
schematics,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
instructional videos and budgets

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
on a wiki.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Then contributors from all over the world

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
began showing up, prototyping new machines

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
during dedicated project visits.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.
