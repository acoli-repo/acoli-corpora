Hi, my name is Marcin --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
farmer, technologist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We've identified the 50 most important machines

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
things from tractors,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
bread ovens, circuit makers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then we set out to create

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
an open source, DIY, do it yourself version

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that anyone can build and maintain

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at a fraction of the cost.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.
