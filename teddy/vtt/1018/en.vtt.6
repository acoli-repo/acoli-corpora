00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
from the dirt beneath my feet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and built a tractor in six days.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If this idea is truly sound,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
then the implications are significant.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A greater distribution of the means of production,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
environmentally sound supply chains,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and a newly relevant DIY maker culture
