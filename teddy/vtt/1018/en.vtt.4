00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And now the project

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is beginning to grow on its own.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We know that open source has succeeded

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We're focusing on hardware

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because it is hardware that can change people's lives

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in such tangible material ways.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's not only in the developing world.
