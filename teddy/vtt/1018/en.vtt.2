00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then it broke again.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then pretty soon,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I was broke too.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I realized

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to start a sustainable farm and settlement

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
just didn't exist yet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I needed tools that were robust, modular,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
highly efficient and optimized,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
low-cost,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
not designed for obsolescence.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I found that I would have to build them myself.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I did just that.
