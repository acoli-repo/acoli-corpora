and a newly relevant DIY maker culture

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
can hope to transcend

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
artificial scarcity.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We're exploring the limits

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of what we all can do to make a better world

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
with open hardware technology.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thank you.
