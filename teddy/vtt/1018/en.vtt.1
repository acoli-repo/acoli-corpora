We call this the Global Village Construction Set.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So let me tell you a story.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So I finished my 20s

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and I discovered I was useless.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I had no practical skills.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The world presented me with options,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I took them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So I started a farm in Missouri

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and learned about the economics of farming.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I paid to get it repaired --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then it broke again.
