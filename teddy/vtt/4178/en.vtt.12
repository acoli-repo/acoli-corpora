(Applause)

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.896
Like Gurmehar said,
and as we all are understanding by now,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.736
exactly how powerful words can be.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.570
How these words have the power to be as soft
as flowers, or as harsh as a thorn,

00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:14.936
they can make someone happy
or hurt someone.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.856
It's extremely important that we use
our words to spread goodness,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.180
spread truth and
spread happiness.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.480
And people understand these things
and feel them, that is important.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.016
Gurmehar, what would you want
to say to young Indians,
