00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.920
It was great timing, since my college’s
mid-semester break was on.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
And it seemed that this will be the
next best decision.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.680
But isn’t it strange, 
that the country in which

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.680
the peaceful practice like
Vipassana was born,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.736
in the very same country
a girl’s life was under threat

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.656
only for saying that
she has no hatred in her heart,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.736
and that she wanted peace for the future.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.456
I had only protested against the violence
in educational campuses and opposed it.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.766
But you tell me why should there be 
any violence in educational institutes?
