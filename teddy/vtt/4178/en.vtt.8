00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.736
How the hatred inside you
forces you to a point

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.436
where a political opinion matters
more than someone’s life.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.130
When I was trying to get a grip on myself,
I repeatedly thought of just one thing:

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.836
that this too shall pass.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.296
In our life, no situation
or emotion is permanent.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.696
These words gave me courage.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.456
Our words are so
immensely powerful,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.736
yet we tend to use them
so carelessly and ruthlessly.
