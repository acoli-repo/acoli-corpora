As kids we would often play this game,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.456
where we would ask each other:

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.376
"If you could be granted one superpower,
what would you want?"

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.336
Today, I want to tell you
all that we all possess a superpower.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Our words.
This is our superpower.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.176
But what do you want
to use your words for?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.336
What will you use your superpower for?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.576
To spread hatred or love?
