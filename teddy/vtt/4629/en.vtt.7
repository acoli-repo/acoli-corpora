SP: When did your love for archaeology
and paleontology and science start?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.976
DJ: Well, in the middle 50s
my husband and I were in the backyard

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.216
digging a garden.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.056
It was late fall, and we were getting
ready for next spring.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.496
And I saw a strange-looking
white rock on the ground.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.656
I picked it up and he said,
"Let me see that."

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.336
I showed it to him
and he said, "You know what this is?"

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.576
I told him I didn't.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.536
He said, "This is a fossil."

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.536
And we took out to the creek
and started looking for fossils.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.320
From then on, there was no turning back.
