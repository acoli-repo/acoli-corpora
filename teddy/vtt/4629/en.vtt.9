Well, like the rainbow --

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.536
at the end of the rainbow
is a pot of gold.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.120
So GlobalXplorer was kind of my rainbow.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.296
And even at my age

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.920
I can continue to hunt
for lost civilizations.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.056
SP: I want to tell you
about some of the incredible things

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.256
that happened as a result
of your discoveries.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.296
We're now beginning
to take thousands of features

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.816
that people like you have found

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.400
and we're sharing them
with archaeologists who work in Peru.
