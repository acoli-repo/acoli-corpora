The really fun title is space archaeology.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.816
You of course want to record
maybe how thick something is,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.856
which you can't measure from space,
whether that's soil or snow.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120
When I won the prize, I had to present
this completely crazy wish.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.696
I had to present the case
for archaeology to the world.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.760
Why does it matter, so what?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.576
The reality is, there aren't
enough of us scientists,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.640
we've got to give more people
opportunities to become explorers.
