Sarah Parcak: A hundred years ago,
archaeology was for the rich,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.256
fifty years ago it was for men.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.896
But we are expanding it to the world.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.696
I wish for us to discover

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.136
the millions of unknown
archaeological sites around the world.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.616
By creating a 21st-century army
of global explorers,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.400
we'll find and protect
the world's hidden heritage.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.816
So how are we going to do this?
