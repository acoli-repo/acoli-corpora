00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:30.637
low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this.

00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:33.824
Incidentally, the study 
of such visual models

00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:37.520
that show the connections and
relationships between different objects

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.327
is known as graph theory.

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:44.345
In a basic graph, the circles representing
the objects are known as nodes,

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:47.274
while the connecting lines 
are called edges.

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:50.693
Researchers studying such graphs
ask questions like,

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:53.135
"How far is this node from that one?"

00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:56.737
"How many edges does 
the most popular node have?"

00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:01.571
"Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?"
