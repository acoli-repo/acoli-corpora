00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:30.763
there are no other connections possible,

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:34.558
so the fourth floor down 
from the top is out.

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:37.743
We know the control panel has to be
as high up as possible,

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:40.025
so let's make our way down the pyramid.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:43.223
The fifth highest floor 
doesn't work either.

00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:45.399
We can figure that out by drawing it,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.821
but to be sure we haven't missed
any possibilities,

00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.364
here's another way.

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:52.616
Every door corresponds to a line
in our graph

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:55.314
that makes two rooms into neighbors.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:59.311
So in the end, there have to be
an even number of neighbors

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.762
no matter how many connections we make.
