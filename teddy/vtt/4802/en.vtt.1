00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.141
The control panel is hidden
behind a painting

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.048
on the highest floor that can satisfy
the following conditions:

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:40.772
Each room has exactly three doors
to other rooms on that floor,

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.672
except the control panel room,

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.589
which connects to only one,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:45.794
there are no hallways,

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:47.857
and you can ignore stairs.

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:50.460
Unfortunately, 
you don't have a floor plan,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.140
and you'll only have enough time
to search a single floor

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.163
before the alarm system reactivates.

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.892
Can you figure out which floor
the control room is on?

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.986
Pause now to solve the riddle yourself.
