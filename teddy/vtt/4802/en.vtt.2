Pause now to solve the riddle yourself.

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:01.824
Answer in: 3

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:02.762
Answer in: 2

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.132
Answer in: 1

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.618
To solve this problem, 
we need to visualize it.

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:10.995
For starters, we know 
that on the correct floor

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:12.154
there's one room,

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:13.798
let's call it room A,

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:16.017
with one door to the control panel room,

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:17.878
plus one door to room B,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.236
and one to C.

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:21.785
So there must be at least four rooms,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.904
which we can represent as circles,

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:26.578
drawing lines between them
for the doorways.

00:01:26.578 --> 00:01:28.764
But once we connect rooms B and C,

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:30.763
there are no other connections possible,
