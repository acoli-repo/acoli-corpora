00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.762
no matter how many connections we make.

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:05.818
On the fifth highest floor,
to fulfill our starting conditions,

00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:08.871
we'd need four rooms 
with three neighbors each,

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.769
plus the control panel room
with one neighbor,

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.081
which makes 13 total neighbors.

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.336
Since that's an odd number,
it's not possible,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:21.754
and, in fact, this also rules out every
floor that has an odd number of rooms.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.975
So let's go one more floor down.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:25.866
When we draw out the rooms,

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:30.637
low and behold, we can find an arrangement
that works like this.
