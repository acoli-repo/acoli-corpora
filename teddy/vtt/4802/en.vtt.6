"Is there a route between these two nodes,
and if so, how long is it?"

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:05.491
Graphs like this are often used
to map communication networks,

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:08.327
but they can represent almost
any kind of network,

00:03:08.327 --> 00:03:10.322
from transport connections within a city

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.353
and social relationships among people,

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:15.116
to chemical interactions between proteins

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:18.536
or the spread of an epidemic
through different locations.

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:22.361
So, armed with these techniques,
back to the pyramid.

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.709
You avoid the guards and security cameras,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.773
infiltrate the sixth floor from the top,

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.148
find the hidden panel,

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:30.148
pull some conspicuous levers,
