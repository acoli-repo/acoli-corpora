WEBVTT

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.890
and we know that
and a great many other things.

00:10:31.914 --> 00:10:35.405
I'm not going to tell you how many times
it took us to make that happen.

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:37.176
(Laughter)

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.072
Okay, I will! It was four.

00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:40.097
(Laughter)

00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:41.286
Way to go, Daria.

00:10:41.647 --> 00:10:45.910
But the important thing about that video

00:10:45.934 --> 00:10:50.502
and the insights we have for every second
of every NBA game -- it's not that.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:54.568
It's the fact you don't have to be
a professional team to track movement.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.740
You do not have to be a professional
player to get insights about movement.

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:02.622
In fact, it doesn't even have to be about
sports because we're moving everywhere.
