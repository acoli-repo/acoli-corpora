00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.157
and it's very exciting because you have
coaches who've been in the league

00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.248
for 30 years that are willing to take
advice from a machine.

00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:08.780
And it's very exciting,
it's much more than the pick-and-roll.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:10.880
Our computer started out
with simple things

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:12.968
and learned more and more complex things

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:14.553
and now it knows so many things.

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:17.412
Frankly, I don't understand
much of what it does,

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:21.151
and while it's not that special
to be smarter than me,

00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:24.819
we were wondering,
can a machine know more than a coach?

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.898
Can it know more than person could know?

00:06:26.922 --> 00:06:28.667
And it turns out the answer is yes.

00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:31.248
The coaches want players
to take good shots.
