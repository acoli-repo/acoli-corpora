00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.290
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:03.879
Or, if he does go close by
and he does stop

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:07.227
but they do it under the basket,
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:09.986
Or I could be wrong,
they could all be pick-and-rolls.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.578
It really depends on the exact timing,
the distances, the locations,

00:03:14.602 --> 00:03:16.097
and that's what makes it hard.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.523
So, luckily, with machine learning,
we can go beyond our own ability

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:23.290
to describe the things we know.

00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:25.594
So how does this work?
Well, it's by example.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.589
So we go to the machine and say,
"Good morning, machine.

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.436
Here are some pick-and-rolls,
and here are some things that are not.
