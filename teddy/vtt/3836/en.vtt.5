00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:31.661
So there's the guy on offense
without the ball

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.894
the ball and he goes next to the guy
guarding the guy with the ball,

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:36.175
and he kind of stays there

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.516
and they both move and stuff happens,
and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.755
(Laughter)

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.287
So that is also an example
of a terrible algorithm.

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:49.117
So, if the player who's the interferer --
he's called the screener --

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:52.150
goes close by, but he doesn't stop,

00:02:52.174 --> 00:02:53.939
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.505
Or if he does stop,
but he doesn't stop close enough,

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.290
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
