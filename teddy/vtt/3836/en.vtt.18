Now unfortunately,
I can't show you that video.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.803
But for you, we recreated that moment

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:07.163
at our weekly basketball game
about 3 weeks ago.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.446
(Laughter)

00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:12.983
And we recreated the tracking
that led to the insights.

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:17.454
So, here is us.
This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,

00:09:17.478 --> 00:09:19.042
a park we play at every week,

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:21.297
and that's us recreating
the Ray Allen moment

00:09:21.321 --> 00:09:23.550
and all the tracking
that's associated with it.

00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:26.289
So, here's the shot.

00:09:26.313 --> 00:09:28.829
I'm going to show you that moment

00:09:28.853 --> 00:09:31.440
and all the insights of that moment.
