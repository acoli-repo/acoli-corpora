00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:32.379
is basically a key to winning
and losing most games.

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:36.204
So it turns out that this dance
has a great many variations

00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:39.876
and identifying the variations
is really the thing that matters,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.429
and that's why we need this
to be really, really good.

00:04:43.228 --> 00:04:44.404
So, here's an example.

00:04:44.428 --> 00:04:46.807
There are two offensive
and two defensive players,

00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.983
getting ready to do
the pick-and-roll dance.

00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:51.690
So the guy with ball
can either take, or he can reject.

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:55.087
His teammate can either roll or pop.

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.097
The guy guarding the ball
can either go over or under.

00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.686
His teammate can either show
or play up to touch, or play soft
