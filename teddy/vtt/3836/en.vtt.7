00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.436
Here are some pick-and-rolls,
and here are some things that are not.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.972
Please find a way to tell the difference."

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:38.783
And the key to all of this is to find
features that enable it to separate.

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.916
So if I was going
to teach it the difference

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.321
between an apple and orange,

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.720
I might say, "Why don't you
use color or shape?"

00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:47.687
And the problem that we're solving is,
what are those things?

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.958
What are the key features

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:52.481
that let a computer navigate
the world of moving dots?

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:57.328
So figuring out all these relationships
with relative and absolute location,

00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:59.261
distance, timing, velocities --

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.368
that's really the key to the science
of moving dots, or as we like to call it,
