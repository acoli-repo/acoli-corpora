00:07:56.266 --> 00:08:00.781
And the reason that's important
is that there are lots of 47s out there.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.263
And so it's really important to know

00:08:04.287 --> 00:08:08.243
if the 47 that you're considering
giving 100 million dollars to

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:11.322
is a good shooter who takes bad shots

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:13.743
or a bad shooter who takes good shots.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.463
Machine understanding doesn't just change
how we look at players,

00:08:18.487 --> 00:08:20.345
it changes how we look at the game.

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:24.124
So there was this very exciting game
a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.

00:08:24.148 --> 00:08:27.355
Miami was down by three,
there was 20 seconds left.

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:29.404
They were about to lose the championship.

00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:32.769
A gentleman named LeBron James
came up and he took a three to tie.
