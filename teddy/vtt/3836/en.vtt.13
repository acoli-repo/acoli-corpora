00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:31.248
The coaches want players
to take good shots.

00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:32.923
So if I'm standing near the basket

00:06:32.947 --> 00:06:35.113
and there's nobody near me,
it's a good shot.

00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:39.077
If I'm standing far away surrounded
by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:43.977
But we never knew how good "good" was,
or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:45.359
Until now.

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.829
So what we can do, again,
using spatiotemporal features,

00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:50.227
we looked at every shot.

00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:53.256
We can see: Where is the shot?
What's the angle to the basket?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.042
Where are the defenders standing?
What are their distances?

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:57.397
What are their angles?

00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:00.398
For multiple defenders, we can look
at how the player's moving
