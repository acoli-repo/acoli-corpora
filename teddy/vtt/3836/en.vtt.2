00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.167
you probably guessed it --

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.587
moving dots.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:06.880
So we've got mountains of moving dots
and like most raw data,

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:09.406
it's hard to deal with
and not that interesting.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.199
But there are things that, for example,
basketball coaches want to know.

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:17.033
And the problem is they can't know them
because they'd have to watch every second

00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:19.646
of every game, remember it and process it.

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:21.734
And a person can't do that,

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:23.068
but a machine can.

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:27.071
The problem is a machine can't see
the game with the eye of a coach.

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:29.624
At least they couldn't until now.
