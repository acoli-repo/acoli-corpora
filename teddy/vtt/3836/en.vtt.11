Coaches trust our ability of our machine
to identify these variations.

00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:41.011
We're at the point where
almost every single contender

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:42.658
for an NBA championship this year

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:47.090

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.157
and it's very exciting because you have
coaches who've been in the league
