00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.368
that's really the key to the science
of moving dots, or as we like to call it,

00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:07.736
spatiotemporal pattern recognition,
in academic vernacular.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:10.823
Because the first thing is,
you have to make it sound hard --

00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:12.125
because it is.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.551
The key thing is, for NBA coaches,
it's not that they want to know

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:17.497
whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.

00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:19.597
It's that they want to know
how it happened.

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:22.607
And why is it so important to them?
So here's a little insight.

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.402
It turns out in modern basketball,

00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:26.965
this pick-and-roll is perhaps
the most important play.

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:29.685
And knowing how to run it,
and knowing how to defend it,

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:32.379
is basically a key to winning
and losing most games.
