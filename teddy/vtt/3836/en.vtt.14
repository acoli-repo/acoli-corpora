00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:00.398
For multiple defenders, we can look
at how the player's moving

00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:01.855
and predict the shot type.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:05.953
We can look at all their velocities
and we can build a model that predicts

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:10.029
what is the likelihood that this shot
would go in under these circumstances?

00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:11.688
So why is this important?

00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:14.905
We can take something that was shooting,

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:17.609
which was one thing before,
and turn it into two things:

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.284
the quality of the shot
and the quality of the shooter.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.942
So here's a bubble chart,
because what's TED without a bubble chart?

00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:25.980
(Laughter)

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:27.315
Those are NBA players.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.459
The size is the size of the player
and the color is the position.
