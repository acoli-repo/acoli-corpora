00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:32.331
So what have we taught the machine to see?

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.356
So, we started simply.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.179
We taught it things like passes,
shots and rebounds.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.744
Things that most casual fans would know.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.600
And then we moved on to things
slightly more complicated.

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:49.212
Events like post-ups,
and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:52.920
And if you don't know them, that's okay.
Most casual players probably do.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.900
Now, we've gotten to a point where today,
the machine understands complex events

00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:01.997
like down screens and wide pins.
