00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:32.769
A gentleman named LeBron James
came up and he took a three to tie.

00:08:32.793 --> 00:08:33.991
He missed.

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:35.852
His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,

00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:38.035
passed it to another teammate
named Ray Allen.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.978
He sank a three. It went into overtime.

00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:42.098
They won the game.
They won the championship.

00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:44.566
It was one of the most exciting
games in basketball.

00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:48.867
And our ability to know
the shot probability for every player

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:50.079
at every second,

00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:53.059
and the likelihood of them getting
a rebound at every second

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:56.526
can illuminate this moment in a way
that we never could before.

00:08:57.618 --> 00:09:00.286
Now unfortunately,
I can't show you that video.
