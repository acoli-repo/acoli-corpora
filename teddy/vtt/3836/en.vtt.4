00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:01.997
like down screens and wide pins.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.747
Basically things only professionals know.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:09.159
So we have taught a machine to see
with the eyes of a coach.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.866
So how have we been able to do this?

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.629
If I asked a coach to describe
something like a pick-and-roll,

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:17.293
they would give me a description,

00:02:17.317 --> 00:02:20.173
and if I encoded that as an algorithm,
it would be terrible.

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:25.304
The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance
in basketball between four players,

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:27.240
two on offense and two on defense.

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:29.104
And here's kind of how it goes.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:31.661
So there's the guy on offense
without the ball
