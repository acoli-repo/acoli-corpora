00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.459
The size is the size of the player
and the color is the position.

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.615
On the x-axis,
we have the shot probability.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.592
People on the left take difficult shots,

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:36.845
on the right, they take easy shots.

00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:39.251
On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.837
People who are good are at the top,
bad at the bottom.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.621
So for example, if there was a player

00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:45.718
who generally made
47 percent of their shots,

00:07:45.718 --> 00:07:47.107
that's all you knew before.

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:52.195
But today, I can tell you that player
takes shots that an average NBA player

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:54.180
would make 49 percent of the time,

00:07:54.204 --> 00:07:55.888
and they are two percent worse.

00:07:56.266 --> 00:08:00.781
And the reason that's important
is that there are lots of 47s out there.
