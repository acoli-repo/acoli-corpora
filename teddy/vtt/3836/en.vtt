My colleagues and I are fascinated
by the science of moving dots.

00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:06.077
So what are these dots?

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:07.388
Well, it's all of us.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:12.497
And we're moving in our homes,
in our offices, as we shop and travel

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.587
throughout our cities
and around the world.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:18.627
And wouldn't it be great
if we could understand all this movement?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.808
If we could find patterns and meaning
and insight in it.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.044
And luckily for us, we live in a time

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:28.565
where we're incredibly good
at capturing information about ourselves.

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:32.470
So whether it's through
sensors or videos, or apps,
