00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:30.301
consists of a 2.4-mile open-water swim
in the Pacific Ocean,

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.952
a 112-mile hand cycle ride
in lava fields --

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.381
now, that sounds exotic,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.564
but it's not as scenic as it sounds,
and it's pretty desolate --

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:41.636
and then you top it off with a marathon,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.281
or a 26.2-mile run in 90-degree heat

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:47.438
using a racing wheelchair.

00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:54.033
That's right, it's a total distance
of 140.6 miles using just your arms

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:56.120
in less than 17 hours.

00:02:56.596 --> 00:03:00.502
No female wheelchair athlete
had ever completed the race
