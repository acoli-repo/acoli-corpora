00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:00.035
the last endemic countries
have reported a total of only 12 cases.

00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:07.006
Since 1988, more than 2.5 billion children
have been immunized against polio,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.386
and an estimated 16 million children,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.066
who otherwise would have been
paralyzed like me,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.355
are walking.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.976
Despite this incredible progress,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.452
we know that until it's eradicated,

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:21.020
polio remains a very real threat,

00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:24.883
especially to children
in the poorest communities of the world.

00:11:24.907 --> 00:11:28.884
It can reemerge in some of the most remote
and dangerous places,

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:31.138
and from there, it can spread.
