00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.394
I volunteered at the local
hospital in high school.

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:33.569
In college, I interned at the White House,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.919
studied abroad in Spain

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:37.450
and backpacked through Europe
all by myself

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:39.172
with my leg braces and crutches.

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:44.232
Upon graduating, I moved to New York City
for a job in management consulting,

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.209
earned an MBA, got married

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.089
and now have a daughter.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:51.811
(Applause)

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:56.201
At age 28, I was introduced
to the sport of hand-cycling,

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.236
and then triathlon,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.299
and by luck, I met Jason Fowler,
an Ironman World Champion,
