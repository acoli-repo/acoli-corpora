00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:04.351
It was October 13, 2012,

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.489
a day that I will never forget.

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:12.408
I was on my bike, pushing up what seemed
like a never-ending barren hill.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:14.246
And it wasn't just any hill:

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.000
it was a 15-mile climb
up to a town called Hawi

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.205
on the Big Island of Hawaii.

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.721
And it wasn't just any ride:

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.323
it was at the Ironman World Championship.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.862
I can still feel my muscles burning.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:31.434
I was struggling, tired and dehydrated,
