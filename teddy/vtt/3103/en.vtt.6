00:02:56.596 --> 00:03:00.502
No female wheelchair athlete
had ever completed the race

00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:04.271
because of the strict,
seemingly impossible cutoff times.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.229
And so there I was,

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:09.281
putting it all out on the line.

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:13.512
And when I finally reached the top
of that 15-mile climb,

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:15.146
I was discouraged.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.051
There was no way I was going
to make that swim in my time limit

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:20.226
of 10 and a half hours,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.995
because I was almost two hours off pace.

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.713
I had to make the agonizing decision

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:28.887
to quit.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.466
I removed my timing chip,
and I handed it over to a race official.
