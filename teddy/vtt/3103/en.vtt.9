00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.027
and it wouldn't be the first time
that I had faced insurmountable odds.

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:34.693
I was born in Bombay, India,

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:38.479
and just before my first birthday,
I contracted polio,

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:41.256
which left me paralyzed
from the hips down.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.858
Unable to care for me, my birth mother
left me at an orphanage.

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:49.268
Fortunately, I was adopted
by an American family,

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:51.265
and I moved to Spokane, Washington

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.271
just shortly after my third birthday.

00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:56.801
Over the next few years,
I underwent a series of surgeries

00:04:56.825 --> 00:04:59.634
on my hips, my legs and my back

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:02.578
that allowed me to walk
with leg braces and crutches.
