00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:00.955
I worried about what my friends,
my family and people at work

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.201
would think of me.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:04.860
What was I going to put on Facebook?

00:04:04.884 --> 00:04:06.034
(Laughter)

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:08.026
How was I going to explain to everyone

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.096
that things didn't go the way
I had assumed or planned?

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:16.375
A few weeks later I was talking
to Shannon about the Kona "disaster,"

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.661
and she said this to me:

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:23.467
"Minda, big dreams and goals can only
be realized when you're ready to fail."

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:27.946
I knew I had to put that failure behind me
in order to move forward,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.027
and it wouldn't be the first time
that I had faced insurmountable odds.
