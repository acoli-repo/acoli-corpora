00:08:55.167 --> 00:09:01.150
I turned left onto a very lonely
15-mile stretch onto the Queen K Highway,

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.739
totally exhausted.

00:09:02.763 --> 00:09:07.438
I pressed on, focusing
on one push at a time.

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.283
By 9:30pm,

00:09:10.307 --> 00:09:14.379
I made that final right-hand turn
onto Ali'i Drive.

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:18.051
I heard the crowd's roar,
and I was overcome with emotion.

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:21.187
I crossed that finish line.

00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:28.211
(Applause)
