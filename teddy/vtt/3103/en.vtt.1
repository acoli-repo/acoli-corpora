00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:31.434
I was struggling, tired and dehydrated,

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.084
as I could feel the heat

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:36.838
emanating from the asphalt,
measuring almost 98 degrees.

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:40.045
I was near the halfway point
of the bike portion

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.028
of one of the most prestigious, longest,

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:45.687
single-day endurance race
events in the world.

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:49.100
Every year, during my childhood,

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.101
I watched this very race on TV
in our family living room.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.554
I sat next to my dad on our 1970s-style
orange and brown sofa,

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.460
and I remember being in utter awe

00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:02.508
at how these athletes
pushed themselves to their limit
