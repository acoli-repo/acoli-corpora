00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:30.639
Among my generation, I am one
of the very few individuals in the US

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.131
who are living with paralysis
by polio today.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.801
Many people who contract polio
in developing countries

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:40.373
do not have access to the same
medical care, education,

00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:43.206
or opportunities
like I have had in America.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.571
Many do not even live to reach adulthood.

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:50.918
I have the humbling knowledge
that, had I not been adopted,

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:53.541
I most certainly
wouldn't be in front of you today.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:56.224
I may not even be alive.

00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:59.801
All of us, in our own lives,

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.786
may face seemingly insurmountable goals.
