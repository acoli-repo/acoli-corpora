00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.252
(Applause ends)

00:09:32.276 --> 00:09:37.117
And my final time
was 14 hours and 39 minutes.

00:09:37.823 --> 00:09:41.149
For the first time in the 35-year history,

00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:43.134
a female wheelchair athlete

00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:45.722
completed the Ironman World Championship.

00:09:45.746 --> 00:09:52.639
(Applause)

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.029
(Applause ends)

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.512
And it wasn't just any female athlete.

00:09:57.536 --> 00:09:58.687
It was me.

00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:00.044
(Laughter)
