00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.299
and by luck, I met Jason Fowler,
an Ironman World Champion,

00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:05.056
at a camp for athletes with disabilities.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.874
And like me, he competed in a wheelchair.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:11.114
And with his encouragement, at age 34,

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:13.342
I decided to go after Kona.

00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.167
The Kona, or Hawaii Ironman

00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.559
is the oldest Iron-distance
race in the sport,

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:23.709
and if you're not familiar,
it's like the Super Bowl of triathlon.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:26.091
And the Ironman,
for a wheelchair athlete like me,

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:30.301
consists of a 2.4-mile open-water swim
in the Pacific Ocean,
