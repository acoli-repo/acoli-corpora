00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:02.508
at how these athletes
pushed themselves to their limit

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:03.863
in this grueling race.

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:05.856
And just so you don't get the wrong idea,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.306
my family members weren't just spectators.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.481
They were incredibly athletic,

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.503
and I always participated
from the sidelines,

00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:17.963
cheering on my three siblings
or handing out water at local races.

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:22.392
I remember wanting so badly
to be able to compete, but I couldn't.

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:25.269
Even though I couldn't play sports,

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.507
I decided to be active in my community.

00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.394
I volunteered at the local
hospital in high school.
