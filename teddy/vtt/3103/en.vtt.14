00:06:57.968 --> 00:07:01.642
I broke up the course
in seven- to 10-mile segments in my mind

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.969
just to reduce the enormity of the race.

00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:08.588
The first 40 miles, they clipped by
as we benefited from a little tail wind.

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:12.771
By 4pm, I had made it to mile 94,

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:16.769
and I did the math and I realized
I was in serious time jeopardy

00:07:16.793 --> 00:07:20.063
because I had 18 miles to go
and less than 90 minutes,

00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:23.333
and that included
a few sizable hill climbs.

00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:25.092
I was stressed out, and I was scared

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:27.723
that I wasn't going to make
that time cutoff again.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:31.548
At this point, I pushed
my internal voice aside that said,
