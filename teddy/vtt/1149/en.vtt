I'm used to thinking of the TED audience

00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:05.191
as a wonderful collection
of some of the most effective,

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:07.976

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:28.139
And believe me, I lived the same sad life
until about three years ago.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.147
And what happened to me
