00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:04.045
I've been thinking a lot about the world recently

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:07.732
and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:10.151
Twenty or 30 years ago,

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:12.681
if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.650
in a remote village in East Asia,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.020
it would have been a tragedy for the chicken

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.217
and its closest relatives,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.425
but I don't think there was much possibility

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.100
of us fearing a global pandemic

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.093
and the deaths of millions.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:27.821
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:29.966
lent too much money to some people

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.987
who couldn't afford to pay it back
