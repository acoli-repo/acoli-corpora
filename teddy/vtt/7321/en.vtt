00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:05.196
Last year, China's leader Xi Jinping
made a historic pledge

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:06.876
to fight global warming.

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:11.316
China will strive to peak
carbon dioxide emissions before 2030

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:14.716
and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.756
But what do those
commitments actually mean?

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:23.316
First, let's consider the magnitude
of these pledges.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:28.996
They call for domestic climate actions
at an unprecedented speed and scale.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:33.556
Due to the size of China,
they will also matter globally.
