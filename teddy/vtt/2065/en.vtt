Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is something in the way of an experiment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Today's its debut.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They are live

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and reacting to me in real time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So fingers crossed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And keep your eyes on the big screen.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
