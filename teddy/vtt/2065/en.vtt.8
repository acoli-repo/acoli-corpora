00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and audiences express their amazement

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
with laughter.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's fun to be fooled.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
One of the key qualities of all stories

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is that they're made to be shared.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000

and ask me to do it again.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They want to share the experience.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
because, if I want to surprise them,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I need to tell a story that starts the same,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but ends differently --
