00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There are tales of creation and loss,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
death and resurrection,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and obstacles that must be overcome.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Magicians play with fire and steel,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
defy the fury of the buzzsaw,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
dare to catch a bullet

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or attempt a deadly escape.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But audiences don't come to see the magician die,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
they come to see him live.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Because the best stories

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
always have a happy ending.
