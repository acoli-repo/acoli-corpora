00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Because the best stories

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
always have a happy ending.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The tricks of magic have one special element.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
They are stories with a twist.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Now Edward de Bono argued

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that our brains are pattern matching machines.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He said that magicians deliberately exploit

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the way their audiences think.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
on the momentum error.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that are perfectly reasonable,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but do not, in fact, match

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
what is being done in front of them.
