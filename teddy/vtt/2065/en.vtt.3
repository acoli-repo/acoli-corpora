00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
a script is just words.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Augmented reality

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is just the latest technology.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And sleight of hand

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is just an artful demonstration

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of dexterity.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We do it every day,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
while reading novels,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
watching television

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or going to the movies.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We willingly enter fictional worlds

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
where we cheer our heroes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and cry for friends we never had.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Without this ability

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
there is no magic.
