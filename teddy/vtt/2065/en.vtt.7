00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but do not, in fact, match

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
what is being done in front of them.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
MT: In that respect,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
magic tricks are like jokes.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Jokes lead us down a path

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to an expected destination.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
into something entirely unexpected,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we laugh.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The same thing happens

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when people watch magic tricks.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The finale

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
defies logic,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
gives new insight into the problem,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and audiences express their amazement
