00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Augmented reality

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is the melding of the real world

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with computer-generated imagery.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It seems the perfect medium

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to investigate magic

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and ask, why, in a technological age,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we continue to have

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this magical sense of wonder.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Magic is deception,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but it is a deception we enjoy.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
To enjoy being deceived,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
an audience must first

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
suspend its disbelief.
