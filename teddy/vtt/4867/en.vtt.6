00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.809
for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age,

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:03.994
with charred stone,

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:05.575
broken arrowheads,

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:09.432
and damaged human skeletons 
suggesting a violent end.

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:12.380
It was Troy VII, 
contained in the middle layers

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.176
and now ravaged for a second time 
by Schliemann’s careless excavation.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.814
The settlement, 
spanning some 200,000 square meters

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:23.333
and home to as many as 10,000 people,

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:26.590
thrived until around 1180 BCE.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.682
Its position at the southern entrance 
of the Dardanelles strait

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:34.095
would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade.
