00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.400
including two diadems 
and a copper shield.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.799
Schliemann took full credit 
for the discovery,

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.698
announcing that he had found Troy

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.949
and the treasure of its king Priam.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.950
But the real treasure was elsewhere.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.277
When later archaeologists 
studied the site,

00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:47.705
they realized that the mound consisted 
of no less than nine cities,

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.399
each built atop the ruins of the last.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.166
The layer Schliemann had uncovered 
dated back to the Mycenaean Age,

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.324
more than 1,000 years too early 
for Homer.

00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.813
But inside the mound was indeed evidence

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.809
for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age,
