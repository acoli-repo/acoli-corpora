00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:00.382
After the war’s end,

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:02.554
Frank Calvert began to survey the site,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:05.628
but lacked the funds 
for a full excavation.

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:07.984
This was where the wealthy 
German businessman

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:12.030
and amateur archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann came in.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.576
At Calvert’s invitation,

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:18.438
Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, 
and decided to excavate.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.194
Eager to find the ancient city,

00:02:20.194 --> 00:02:24.116
Schliemann tore massive trenches 
all the way to the base of the hill.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:27.871
There, he uncovered a hoard 
of precious artifacts,

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:28.603
jewelry,

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:29.414
and metalwork,

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.400
including two diadems 
and a copper shield.
