00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:34.095
would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:38.362
Most importantly, there are the remains 
of a massive fortification wall –

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:40.078
perhaps the very same one

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:44.306
from which Priam and Hector 
once watched the Greeks approach.

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:46.412
Of course, it’s difficult to be certain

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:50.314
that these ruins are the true remains 
of ancient Troy,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:51.771
and scholars still dispute

00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:55.432
whether the Trojan War 
as described by Homer ever happened.

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.214
Yet the evidence is strong enough

00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:01.615
that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık
the archeological site of Troy.
