never to rise again.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.001
But had it ever existed?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:39.153
By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century,

00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:43.273
many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction,

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.084
a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era.

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:48.413
But some scholars believed

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:51.887
that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.754
there must have been a grain 
of historical truth -

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.437
a war that was really fought,

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:58.638
and a place where it happened.

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:01.187
Frank Calvert was one such believer.
