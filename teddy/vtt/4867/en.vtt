00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.876
When Homerâ€™s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE,

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.192
the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one.

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:17.799
From existing oral tradition,

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.718
audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege,

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:23.427
the epic duels outside the city walls,

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:26.156
and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:29.672
In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground,

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:31.509
never to rise again.
