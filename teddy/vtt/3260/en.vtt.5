(Applause and cheers)

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.976
Thank you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.016
I recently had the tremendous opportunity
of searching for gold

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.616
in the vast mine of songs
released by Chess Records,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.616
a Chicago-based label that was really
very active in the '50s and '60s in the US

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.736
and that music spread all over the world.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.136
And the songs that I'm singing tonight

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.656
are from an album that I just put out
called, "Playing Chess,"
