In the third millenium BCE,

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:13.806
Mesopotamian kings recorded and
interpreted their dreams on wax tablets.

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:15.146
A thousand years later,

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:17.248
Ancient Egyptians wrote a dream book

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:20.654
listing over a hundred common dreams
and their meanings.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.863
And in the years since,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.650
we haven't paused in our quest
to understand why we dream.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.121
So, after a great deal
of scientific research,

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.787
technological advancement,

00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:31.005
and persistence,
