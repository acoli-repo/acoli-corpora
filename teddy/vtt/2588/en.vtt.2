00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.976
it must collectively know the location
of its mobile objects in space.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.896
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.776
we often use external cameras
to locate objects,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.776
which then allows us to focus our efforts

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.456
on the rapid development
of highly dynamic tasks.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.536
For the demos you will see today, however,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.856
we will use new localization technology
developed by Verity Studios,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.496
a spin-off from our lab.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.136
There are no external cameras.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.216
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors
to determine its location in space

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.680
and onboard computation
to determine what its actions should be.
