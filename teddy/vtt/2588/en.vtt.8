00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120
We recently discovered
that it could be done with just one.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.856
This is the monospinner,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.136
the world's mechanically simplest
controllable flying machine,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.936
invented just a few months ago.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.096
It has only one moving part, a propeller.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.696
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.255
no other actuators,
no other control surfaces,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.560
just a simple propeller.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.375
Even though it's mechanically simple,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.896
there's a lot going on
in its little electronic brain

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.136
to allow it to fly in a stable fashion
and to move anywhere it wants in space.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.616
Even so, it doesn't yet have

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.976
the sophisticated algorithms
of the tail-sitter,
