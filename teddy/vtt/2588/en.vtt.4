00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.456
This is a so-called tail-sitter.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.936
It's an aircraft that tries
to have its cake and eat it.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.216
Like other fixed-wing aircraft,
it is efficient in forward flight,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.455
much more so than helicopters
and variations thereof.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.896
Unlike most other
fixed-wing aircraft, however,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.416
it is capable of hovering,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.576
which has huge advantages
for takeoff, landing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.840
and general versatility.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.576
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.536
One of the limitations with tail-sitters

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.536
is that they're susceptible
to disturbances such as wind gusts.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.256
We're developing new control
architectures and algorithms

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680
that address this limitation.
