00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.136
in front of a live audience
at the FRAC Centre in France,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.736
and several years ago,
they started to fly with ropes.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.176
By tethering flying machines,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.976
they can achieve high speeds
and accelerations in very tight spaces.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.096
They can also autonomously build
tensile structures.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.536
Skills learned include how to carry loads,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.016
how to cope with disturbances,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.136
and in general, how to interact
with the physical world.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.496
Today we want to show you some
new projects that we've been working on.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.456
Their aim is to push the boundary
of what can be achieved

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.016
with autonomous flight.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.496
Now, for a system to function
autonomously,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.976
it must collectively know the location
of its mobile objects in space.
