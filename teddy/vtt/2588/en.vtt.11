00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.496
This gives it an extraordinary capability.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.736
It can move anywhere it wants in space

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.496
irrespective of where it is facing

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
and even of how it is rotating.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.416
It has its own complexities,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.096
mainly having to do
with the interacting flows

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.360
from its eight propellers.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.536
Some of this can be modeled,
while the rest can be learned on the fly.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.760
Let's take a look.
