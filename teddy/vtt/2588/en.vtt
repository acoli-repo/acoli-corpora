Inspection, environmental monitoring,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.136
these are some of the potential

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.776
and their enablers
are the capabilities being developed

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.736
at research facilities around the world.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.376

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.216

an autonomous fleet of flying machines
built a six-meter-tall tower

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.176
composed of 1,500 bricks

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.136
in front of a live audience
at the FRAC Centre in France,
