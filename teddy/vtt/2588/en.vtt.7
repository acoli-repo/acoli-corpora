00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.456
For example, one such question would be,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.496
what is the minimum number of moving parts
needed for controlled flight?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.096
Now, there are practical reasons

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.736
why you may want to know
the answer to such a question.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.016
Helicopters, for example,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.896
are affectionately known
as machines with a thousand moving parts

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.600
all conspiring to do you bodily harm.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.496
It turns out that decades ago,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.696
skilled pilots were able to fly
remote-controlled aircraft

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.616
that had only two moving parts:

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.480
a propeller and a tail rudder.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120
We recently discovered
that it could be done with just one.
