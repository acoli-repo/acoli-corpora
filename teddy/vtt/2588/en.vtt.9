the sophisticated algorithms
of the tail-sitter,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which means that in order
to get it to fly,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.744
I have to throw it just right.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.816
And because the probability
of me throwing it just right is very low,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.736
given everybody watching me,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.216
what we're going to do instead

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.416
is show you a video
that we shot last night.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.640
(Applause)
