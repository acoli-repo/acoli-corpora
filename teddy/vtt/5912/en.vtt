Every day, billions of stocks are traded 
on the New York Stock Exchange alone.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:17.519
But with over 43,000 companies listed 
on stock exchanges around the world,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.279
how do investors decide 
which stocks to buy?

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.135
To answer this question, itâ€™s important 
to first understand what stocks are,

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:31.749
and what individuals and institutions 
hope to achieve by investing in them.
