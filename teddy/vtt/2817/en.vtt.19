00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.530
under elegant mounds,

00:09:31.554 --> 00:09:35.235
marked only by a rock
or a small metal disk,

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:38.157
or sometimes only locatable by GPS.

00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:40.417
There's no embalming,

00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:42.640
no heavy, metal caskets.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.505
My funeral home sells a few caskets

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:49.281
made out of things like
woven willow and bamboo,

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:53.028
but honestly, most of our families
just choose a simple shroud.

00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:57.819
There are none of the big vaults
that most cemeteries require

00:09:57.843 --> 00:10:01.162
just because it makes it easier
for them to landscape.
