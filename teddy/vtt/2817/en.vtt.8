00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:01.677
We're wasting all of these resources --
concretes, metal, hardwoods --

00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.466
hiding them in vast
underground fortresses.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.848
When you choose burial at the cemetery,

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:14.165
your dead body is not coming anywhere
near the dirt that surrounds it.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.304
Food for worms

00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:17.505
you are not.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:23.476
Next, the industry will sanitize
your body through embalming:

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.701
the chemical preservation of the dead.

00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:28.240
This procedure drains your blood

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:32.566
and replaces it with a toxic,
cancer-causing formaldehyde.
