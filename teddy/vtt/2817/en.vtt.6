It ignores the fact

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.646
that death can be an emotionally messy
and complex affair,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.214
and that there is beauty in decay --

00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:13.651
beauty in the natural return
to the earth from whence we came.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.096
Now, I don't want you to get me wrong --

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.107
I absolutely understand
the importance of ritual,

00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:23.232
especially when it comes
to the people that we love.

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:26.791
But we have to be able
to create and practice this ritual

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.596
without harming the environment,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.559
which is why we need new options.
