The beauty of this is that once you plant
a few dead bodies in that land,

00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:03.146
it can't be touched,
it can't be developed on --

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.968
hence the term, "conservation burial."

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:09.874
It's the equivalent of chaining yourself
to a tree post-mortem --

00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:12.362
"Hell no, I won't go!

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.431
No, really -- I can't.
I'm decomposing under here."

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.550
(Laughter)

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:18.895
Any money that the family
gives to the cemetery

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:22.428
would go back into protecting
and managing the land.

00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:27.775
There are no headstones
and no graves in the typical sense.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.946
The graves are scattered
about the property

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.530
under elegant mounds,
