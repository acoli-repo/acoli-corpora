00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:34.359
providing the illusion that death
and then decay are not the natural end

00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:37.268
for all organic life on this planet.

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:43.627
Now, if this system of beautification,
sanitation, protection

00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:45.844
doesn't appeal to you,

00:05:45.868 --> 00:05:47.267
you are not alone.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.806
There is a whole wave of people --

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.794
funeral directors, designers,
environmentalists --

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:56.629
trying to come up with a more
eco-friendly way of death.

00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:59.863
For these people, death is not necessarily

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:04.079
a pristine, makeup,
powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.
