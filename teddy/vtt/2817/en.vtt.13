00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:30.482
So where do we go from here?

00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:34.720
Last summer, I was in the mountains
of North Carolina,

00:06:34.744 --> 00:06:38.091
hauling buckets of wood chips
in the summer sun.

00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.930
I was at Western Carolina University
at their "Body Farm,"

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:46.786
more accurately called
a "human decomposition facility."

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:50.039
Bodies donated to science
are brought here,

00:06:50.063 --> 00:06:54.087
and their decay is studied
to benefit the future of forensics.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.108
On this particular day,

00:06:56.132 --> 00:07:00.703
there were 12 bodies laid out
in various stages of decomposition.
