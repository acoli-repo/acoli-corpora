00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:31.591
what I am proposing for my dead body
is not strictly legal at the moment,

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.606
but it's not without precedent.

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:37.692
We've been laying out our dead
for all of human history;

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:39.785
it's call exposure burial.

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:44.356
In fact, it's likely happening
right now as we speak.

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:47.095
In the mountainous regions of Tibet,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.183
they practice "sky burial,"

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:53.098
a ritual where the body is left
to be consumed by vultures.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:58.951
In Mumbai, in India,
those who follow the Parsi religion

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:03.252
put their dead in structures
called "Towers of Silence."
