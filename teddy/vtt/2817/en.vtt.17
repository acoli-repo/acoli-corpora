So that's one option
for the future of cremation.

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.570
But what about the future of cemeteries?

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:37.177
There are a lot of people who think
we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore

00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:39.240
because we're running out of land.

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:42.190
But what if we reframed it,

00:08:42.214 --> 00:08:44.819
and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,

00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:46.802
but its potential savior?

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.358
I'm talking about conservation burial,

00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:54.441
where large swaths of land
are purchased by a land trust.

00:08:55.274 --> 00:09:00.104
The beauty of this is that once you plant
a few dead bodies in that land,
