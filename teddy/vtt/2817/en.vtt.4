00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.428
It means accepting
that we are doomed to decay and die,

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:04.694
just like any other creature on earth.

00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.870
For the last nine years,
I've worked in the funeral industry,

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.025
first as a crematory operator,

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.527
then as a mortician

00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:16.663
and most recently, as the owner
of my own funeral home.

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:19.074
And I have some good news:

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:24.670
if you're looking to avoid the whole
"doomed to decay and die" thing:

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:28.910
you will have all the help
in the world in that avoidance

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:30.711
from the funeral industry.
