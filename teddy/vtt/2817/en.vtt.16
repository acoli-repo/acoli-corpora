00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.240
In a traditional cremation,
the ashes that are left over --

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:06.250
inorganic bone fragments --

00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:08.525
form a thick, chalky layer

00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:11.772
that, unless distributed
in the soil just right,

00:08:11.796 --> 00:08:14.973
can actually hurt or kill the tree.

00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.857
But if you're recomposed,
if you actually become the soil,

00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:20.415
you can nourish the tree,

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.128
and become the post-mortem contributor
you've always wanted to be --

00:08:24.152 --> 00:08:25.945
that you deserve to be.

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:30.161
So that's one option
for the future of cremation.
