00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.144
There's no question

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:10.095
that our current methods of death
are not particularly sustainable,

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.755
what with the waste of resources
and our reliance on chemicals.

00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:15.840
Even cremation,

00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:19.582
which is usually considered
the environmentally friendly option,

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:21.844
uses, per cremation,

00:06:21.868 --> 00:06:26.768
the natural gas equivalent
of a 500-mile car trip.

00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:30.482
So where do we go from here?
