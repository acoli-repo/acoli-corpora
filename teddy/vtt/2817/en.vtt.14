00:06:56.132 --> 00:07:00.703
there were 12 bodies laid out
in various stages of decomposition.

00:07:00.727 --> 00:07:03.008
Some were skeletonized,

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:05.404
one was wearing purple pajamas,

00:07:05.428 --> 00:07:08.164
one still had blonde facial hair visible.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.119
The forensic aspect is really fascinating,

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:14.539
but not actually why I was there.

00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:17.825
I was there because a colleague of mine
named Katrina Spade

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:22.189
is attempting to create a system,
not of cremating the dead,

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:24.163
but composting the dead.

00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:27.443
She calls the system "Recomposition,"

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:31.139
and we've been doing it with cattle
and other livestock for years.
