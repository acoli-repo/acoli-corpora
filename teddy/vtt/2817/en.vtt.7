which is why we need new options.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:37.455
So let's return to the idea of protection,
sanitation and beautification.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.255
We'll start with a dead body.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:42.871
The funeral industry
will protect your dead body

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:47.736
by offering to sell your family a casket
made of hardwood or metal

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.639
with a rubber sealant.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.834

that casket will be lowered

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.995
into a large concrete or metal vault.

00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:01.677
We're wasting all of these resources --
concretes, metal, hardwoods --
