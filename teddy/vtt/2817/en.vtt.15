00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:35.819
where the family could come
and lay their dead loved one

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:40.274
in a nutrient-rich mixture that would,
in four-to-six weeks,

00:07:40.298 --> 00:07:43.902
reduce the body -- bones
and all -- to soil.

00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:46.247

00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:48.729

00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:50.491
you literally transform.

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.385

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:57.914
to be buried under a tree,

00:07:57.938 --> 00:07:59.999
or to become a tree when they die?
