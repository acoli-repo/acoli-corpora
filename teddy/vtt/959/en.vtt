00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.505
We have a global health challenge

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:04.197
in our hands today,

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:07.257
and that is that the way we currently

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:10.182
discover and develop new drugs

00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:14.360
is too costly, takes far too long,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.074
and it fails more often than it succeeds.

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:21.451
It really just isn't working, and that means

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.498
that patients that badly need new therapies

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:26.209
are not getting them,

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:29.707
and diseases are going untreated.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:32.790
We seem to be spending more and more money.
