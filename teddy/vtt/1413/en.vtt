So I have bad news, I have good news,

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.024
and I have a task.

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.967
So the bad news is that we all get sick.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:10.239
I get sick. You get sick.

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.781
And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.658
how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:17.003
Is it something that we survive?

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.931
Is it something that we can treat?

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.187
And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:25.673
And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:27.630
And for a long time, it was the gods, right?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.784
The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,
