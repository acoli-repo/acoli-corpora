mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:03.768
Ends up that the bag is stronger,
the fiber is stronger,

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.476
it didn't cost us more money.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.042
It was win-win.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.976
Another idea they had

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.643
was that we could reduce
our napkin by one inch.

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:21.250
And make it from recycled office paper.

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:25.559
I'm thinking, one inch, no big deal.

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:29.684
We did it, it reduced waste
by three million pounds a year.

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:32.184
Sixteen thousand trees saved.
