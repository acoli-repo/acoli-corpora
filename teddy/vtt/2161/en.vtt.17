because our direct suppliers,
they only make meat patties.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.559
The animals are three or four steps
removed from our influence.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.851
And they were very empathetic.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:40.643
And while we were so directly opposed

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.434
in terms of the missions
of our organizations,

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:45.268
I felt that I had learned a lot.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:48.976
And best of all, they gave me
a terrific recommendation.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.351
And that is, they said,

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.393
"You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin."

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:56.101
Now, I didn't know her at the time.

00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:57.393
But I tell you,

00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:02.643
she's the most renowned expert,
then and now, on animal behavior.
