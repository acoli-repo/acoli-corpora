00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:02.351
And I was wondering if the report
that they had just released,

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.768
it was called "Eating Up the Amazon."

00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:08.184
And by the way, soy
is a key ingredient for chicken feed,

00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:10.726
and that's the connection to McDonald's.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.893
So I called my trusted friends
at the World Wildlife Fund,

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:16.393
I called Conservation International,

00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:21.518
and I soon learned that
the Greenpeace report was accurate.

00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:23.268
So I gathered internal support,

00:11:23.292 --> 00:11:26.518
and I'll always remember,
next day, after that campaign,

00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:27.809
I called them up,

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:30.167
and I said, "We agree with you."
