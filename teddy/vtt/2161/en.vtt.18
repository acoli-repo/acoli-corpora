00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:02.643
she's the most renowned expert,
then and now, on animal behavior.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:06.833
And she knows how animals move
and how they should react in facilities.

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.226
So I end up meeting her,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.476
and she's the very best type of critic,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.726
in a sense that
she just loves the animals,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.018
wants to protect them,

00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:19.726
but she also understands
the reality of the meat business.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.018
And I'll always remember,

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:24.018
I had never been
to a slaughterhouse in my life,

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:26.476
and so I go with her for my first trip.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.518
I didn't know what to expect.

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:33.976
And we find that the animal handlers
have electric prods in their hands,
