00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:00.351
And compared to their
experience at McDonald's

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:01.726
that's clean and organized,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.518
they could see the stark difference.

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:07.518
We also sat in a restaurant
at McDonald's, all day long,

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:10.518
and watched the customers eating in.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.976
Their behavior.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.684
Ends up that many customers
left with the food,

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:16.393
they left with the beverage.

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:19.268
And EDF came to their own conclusion

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:22.184
that reusables wouldn't work for us.

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:25.768
But they did have
a lot of ideas that did work.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:28.768
And we never would have thought
of them by ourselves,

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:30.684
without the EDF team.
