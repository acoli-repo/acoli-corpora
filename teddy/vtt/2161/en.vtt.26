WEBVTT

00:12:57.833 --> 00:13:00.268
was announced by the industry.

00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:05.351
And Greenpeace themselves declared it
as a spectacular drop in deforestation

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.500
and it's been in effect ever since.

00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:11.976
Now, you think these types
of collaborations that I've described

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.351
would be commonplace today.

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:15.768
But they're not.

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:18.268
When organizations are battered,

00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:22.059
the common response
is to deny and push back,

00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:24.143
put out some sort of lame statement

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:26.893
and no progress is made at all.

00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:29.768
I say the alternative is really powerful.

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:32.018
I mean, it's not going to fix
every problem,
