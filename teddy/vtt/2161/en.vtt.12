00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:01.643
we went to a ball game together.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.667
We became friends.

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:06.893
And that's when I learned a life lesson.

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.851
That these NGO crusaders,

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.643
they're really no different than me.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:14.059
They care, they have passion,

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:16.184
we're just not different.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.226
So, we had a six-month partnership

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.684
that ended up producing a 42-point
waste reduction action plan.

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:25.351
To reduce, reuse, recycle.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.476
We measured it during
the decade of the '90s,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.250
and over 10 years we reduced
300 million pounds of waste.
