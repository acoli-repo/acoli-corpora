00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.476
But as I went into university,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.726
I realized that I'm not
going to make a living doing this.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.268
And that whole movement had subsided,

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:43.684
and my activist spirit went dormant.

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:45.184
And I needed to make a living,

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:47.167
so I got involved in the business world.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.643
So, now these students against pollution,

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.893
who were sending those
protest letters to McDonald's,

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:57.976
they reminded me of myself 20 years ago.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.018
They're questioning authority.
