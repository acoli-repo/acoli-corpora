00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:30.684
without the EDF team.

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:34.934
My favorite was switching
from the white carry-out bag

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.583
to the brown bag.

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.226
We had been using the white bag.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.184
It's virgin material,

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:50.559
it's made from chlorine
bleaching chemicals,

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:53.101
and they said, use an unbleached bag,

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.500
no chemicals.

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.476
It's made from recycled content,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.101
mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes.
