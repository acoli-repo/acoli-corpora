00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.143
And I remember sitting down,
getting ready,

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.559
and I decided I'm not
going to order my favorite,

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.934
which is you know, bacon
and sausage and eggs.

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.101
(Laughter)

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.684
And I'm just going to stick
to the pastries.

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:11.976
But I have to admit,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.309
I was waiting for the adversarial
discussion to happen.

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:17.268
And it never did.

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:20.018
Henry and Peter were just gracious,

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:23.559
they were caring, they were smart,
they asked good questions.

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:26.143
I told them about
how working on animal welfare

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.559
is very tough for McDonald's

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:31.476
because our direct suppliers,
they only make meat patties.
