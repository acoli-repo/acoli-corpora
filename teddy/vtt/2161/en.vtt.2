But it all sounded intriguing to me

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:08.792
because it brought me back to my roots.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.809
You see, I grew up
in the late '60s, early '70s,

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:20.500
in a time of huge social upheaval
in the United States.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.434
And I was really in tune

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.184
the anti-Vietnam sentiment,

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:29.875
and I really felt there was a need
to question authority.
