00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:00.750
So we did the logical thing.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.143
We had them flip burgers
in our restaurants.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:07.184
So you have to imagine Richard,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.018
who, by the way, is a PhD in physics,

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.809
and there he is, he's trying
to dress a quarter-pounder,

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.851
and you're supposed to have
two squirts of ketchup, one mustard,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.268
three pickles and an onion,
go on to the next one,

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:19.559
you've got to be so fast.

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:22.309
And you know what?
He couldn't get it right all day long.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.934
And he was frustrated.

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.851
And I was so impressed,

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:30.625
because he was trying
to understand our business.
