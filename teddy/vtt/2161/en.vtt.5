00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:30.309
They were an NGO

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:34.750
that was founded with the principle
of "sue the bastards."

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:37.601
So I'm thinking,

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.434
what are they thinking
about me and my team?

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.934
When I first met Richard Denison,

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.351
he's the senior scientist for EDF,

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.143
I was very apprehensive.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.059
I thought he's a tree-hugger,

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:53.434
and I'm thinking he thinks
all I care about is the money.

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:58.851
So we wanted the EDF team
to give us real-world solutions.

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:00.750
So we did the logical thing.
