00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:01.351
I admit, I did not like
a lot of the tactics

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.101
used on my company.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:06.268
But instead, focus on what the truth is,

00:14:06.292 --> 00:14:07.851
what's the right thing to do,

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.934

00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.226
And lastly, you know, I would say,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.684

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:19.809
Bring them there, don't hide the details,

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:22.351
because if you want allies and support,

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.792
you need to be open and transparent.

00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:29.059
Now, whether you're a corporate suit,

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:31.018
whether you're a tree-hugger,
