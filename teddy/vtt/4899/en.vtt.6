00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.470
Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.880
By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.750
around 400,000 kilometers away,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.690
Earth’s gravitational pull would be

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.520
less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.667
The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s,

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.857
which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s.

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:22.377
Travel farther still

00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:26.177
and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease,

00:03:26.177 --> 00:03:28.757
but never drop to zero.

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.126
Even safely tethered to the Earth,
