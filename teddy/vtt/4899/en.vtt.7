00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.126
Even safely tethered to the Earth,

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:38.206
we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones.

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:41.681
The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you.

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.911
If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience

00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:48.411
a mutual force of a few piconewtons.

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.971
That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.921
between you and the Andromeda Galaxy,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.781
which is 2.5 million light years away

00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:00.641
but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun.
