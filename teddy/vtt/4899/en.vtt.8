00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:00.641
but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.791
But when it comes to escaping gravity,

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.011
there’s a loophole.

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:07.531
If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time,

00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.491
how would Earth’s gravity change

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.961
if you tunneled deep below the surface,

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:15.757
assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed?

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:19.847
If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth—

00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:22.147
which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were—

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:25.977
you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides.

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:28.307
And you’d be suspended, weightless,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:32.497
only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies.
