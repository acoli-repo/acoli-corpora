00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.955
So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions?

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:05.295
Two reasons: mass and distance.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:09.825
The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.995
was written by Isaac Newton in 1687.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:17.655
Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then,

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.355
but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:24.135
is still a good approximation 
in most situations.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:25.495
It goes like this:

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.215
the gravitational force between two 
objects

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.035
is equal to the mass of one
