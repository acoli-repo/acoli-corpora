00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.460
which bend around any object 
that has mass.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.710
Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.200
400 kilometers above the earth,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.820
with almost its original intensity.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.390
If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.450
you’d still experience ninety percent

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.360
of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.900
Astronauts just experience weightlessness

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.470
Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground.
