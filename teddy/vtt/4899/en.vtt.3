00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.035
is equal to the mass of one

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.925
times the mass of the other,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.065
multiplied by a very small number

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.205
called the gravitational constant,

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:40.335
and divided by the distance between them, 
squared.

00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:42.695
If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.195
the force between them would double, too.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.075
If the distance between them doubled,

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.125
the force would be one-fourth as strong.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:55.126
The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center,

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:57.886
a force you experience as your weight.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:00.626
Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons
