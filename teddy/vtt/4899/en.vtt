00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:08.895
More than six thousand light years

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:10.335
from the surface of the earth,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.575
a rapidly spinning neutron star

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.765
called the Black Widow pulsar

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.665
blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:22.855
as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.525
Standing on our own planet,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.995
you might think youâ€™re just an observer
of this violent ballet.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.545
But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them.
