00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:00.626
Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.436
when you’re standing at sea level.

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:04.336
If you traveled to the Dead Sea,

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:08.116
the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:12.276
And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease—

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:15.603
but again, by a minuscule amount.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:19.338
Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence,

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.438
but you won’t escape it.

00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:25.838
Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime—

00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:28.388
the three dimensions of space plus time—

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.460
which bend around any object 
that has mass.
