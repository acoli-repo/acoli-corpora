00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.545
But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.165
And you’re pulling back,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.495
connected across trillions of kilometers

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:37.665
by gravity.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.075
Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass—

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.275
any two objects with mass.

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:49.505
Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object:

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:51.595
every star, black hole,

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:54.755
human being, smartphone, and atom

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.295
are all constantly pulling on each other.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.955
So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions?
