Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I remember these Turkish carpets,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,
