In the early 1900s on the island of Crete,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.172
British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
uncovered nearly 3,000 tablets

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:16.662
inscribed with strange symbols.

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:19.432
He thought these symbols represented
the language spoken

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:21.922
by Europeâ€™s oldest civilization.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:25.922
Their meaning would elude scholars 
for 50 years.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.213
Evans discovered these tablets 
amid the colorful frescoes

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:32.853
and maze-like hallways
of the palace of Knossos.
