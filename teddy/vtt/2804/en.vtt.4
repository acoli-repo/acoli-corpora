00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.616
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
died of drug overdoses associated
with prescription drugs and heroin.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.760
During the 1980s, scores of people
were dying from HIV and AIDS.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440
Public officials ignored it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.440
Some wouldn't even utter the words.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440
They didn't want treatment.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.560
And tragically, there are many parallels
with our current epidemic.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.360
Some called it the gay plague.
