00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.400
So the Obama administration
has taken a different tack on drug policy.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.496
We've developed and implemented
a comprehensive plan

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.896
to expand prevention services,
treatment services,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.560
early intervention and recovery support.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.585
We've pushed criminal justice reform.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.360
We've knocked down barriers
to give people second chances.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.296
We see public health and public safety
officials working hand in hand

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.520
at the community level.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.656
We see police chiefs across the country
guiding people to treatment

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.320
instead of jail and incarceration.
