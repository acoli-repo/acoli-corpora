00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.056
despite the fact that I had been
in recovery for over 20 years,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.296
and despite the fact

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.296
that this job takes a little bit
of knowledge around addiction.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.800
(Laughter)

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.576
So, you know, this is the stigma

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.656
that people with
substance use disorders

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.080
face every single day,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.456
and you know, I have to tell you

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.936
it's still why I'm more comfortable
coming out as a gay man

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.480
than I am as a person
with a history of addiction.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.040
Nearly every family in America
is affected by addiction.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.280
Yet, unfortunately, too often,
it's not talked about openly and honestly.
