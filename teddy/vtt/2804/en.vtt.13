Today in the United States,
only one in nine people

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.976
get care and treatment for their disorder.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.576
One in nine.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.800
Think about that.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.656
Generally, people with other diseases
get care and treatment.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.656
If you have cancer, you get treatment,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.696
if you have diabetes, you get treatment.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.056
If you have a heart attack,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.780
you get emergency services,
and you get referred to care.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.416
But somehow people with addiction
have to wait for treatment

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.560
or often can't get when they need it.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.760
And left untreated, addiction
has significant, dire consequences.
