00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.296
growing up as a gay kid

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.080
just compounded my issues
of isolation and insecurities.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.210
But drinking took all of that away.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.960
Like many, I drank at an early age.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040
I continued to drink
my way through college.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.656
And when I finally did come out
in the early 1980s,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.496
about the only places
to meet other gay people,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.720
to socialize,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.200
to be yourself, were gay bars.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.840
And what do you do in gay bars?
