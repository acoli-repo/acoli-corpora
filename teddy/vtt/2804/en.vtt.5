Some called it the gay plague.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.080
They called for quarantines.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.560
They wanted to separate
the innocent victims from the rest of us.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.456
I was afraid we were losing this battle

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440
because people were
blaming us for being sick.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.120
Public policy was being held hostage
by stigma and fear,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.136
and also held hostage

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.760
were compassion, care,
research, recovery and treatment.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.840
But we changed all that.
