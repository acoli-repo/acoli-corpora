00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.176
I want us to see that we need to be open
and candid about who we are

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400
and what we can do.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.696
I am public about my own recovery

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.640
not to be self-congratulatory.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.296
I am open about my own recovery
to change public opinion,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.216
to change public policy

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.136
and to change the course of this epidemic
and empower the millions of Americans

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.016
who struggle with this journey

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.000
to be open and candid
about who they are.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.960
People are more than their disease.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.176
And all of us have the opportunity
to change public opinion
