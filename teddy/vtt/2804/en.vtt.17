Unless we change the way
that we view people with addiction

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.080
in the United States.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.976
Years ago when I finally
understood that I had a problem

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.135
and I knew that I needed help,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.799
I was too afraid to ask for it.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.520
I felt that people would think
I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.250
that I was morally flawed.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.400
But I talk about my recovery
because I want to make change.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.176
I want us to see that we need to be open
and candid about who we are
