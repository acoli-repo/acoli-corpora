Yet, unfortunately, too often,
it's not talked about openly and honestly.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.816
It's whispered about.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.200
It's met with derision and scorn.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.960
We hear these stories,
time and time again, on TV, online,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.200
we hear it from public officials,
and we hear it from family and friends.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520
And those of us with an addiction,
we hear those voices,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.680
and somehow we believe that we are
less deserving of care and treatment.
