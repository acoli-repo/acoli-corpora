00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Twenty-eight years ago,
I was a broken man.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.640
And you probably wouldn't be able
to tell that if you met me.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.120
I had a good job at a well-respected
academic institution.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120
I dressed well, of course.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.480
But my insides were rotting away.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.600
You see, I grew up in a family
riddled with addiction,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.100
and as a kid, I also struggled

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.896
with coming to terms
with my own sexuality.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.256
And even though I couldn't name it then,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.296
growing up as a gay kid
