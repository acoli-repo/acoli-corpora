00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.840
But we changed all that.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.056
Because out of the pain of those deaths,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800
we saw a social and political movement.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160
AIDS galvanized us into action;

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.160
to stand up, to speak up and to act out.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.760
And it also galvanized
the LGBT movement.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.456
We knew we were
in a battle for our lives

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.040
because silence equaled death,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
but we changed,
and we made things happen.
