00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.576
This was an effort started
by Cleve Jones in San Francisco

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.576
to show that people who died of AIDS

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.800
had names

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.360
and faces and families

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.800
and people who loved them.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.959
I still recall unfolding
the AIDS memorial quilt

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.480
on the National Mall
on a brilliant day in October, 1988.
