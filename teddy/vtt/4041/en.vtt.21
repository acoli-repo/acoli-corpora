00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.120
It's a test of our humanity.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.296
It's a test of us in the Western world

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.520
of who we are and what we stand for.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.800
It's a test of our character,
not just our policies.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.136
And refugees are a hard case.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.480
They do come from faraway
parts of the world.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.600
They have been through trauma.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.176
They're often of a different religion.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.376
Those are precisely the reasons
we should be helping refugees,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.840
not a reason not to help them.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.600
And it's a reason to help them
because of what it says about us.
