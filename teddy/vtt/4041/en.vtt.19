00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.176
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful
Greek island, two years ago.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.056
It's a home to 90,000 people.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.560
In one year, 500,000 refugees
went across the island.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.056
And I want to show you what I saw

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.416
when I drove across
to the north of the island:

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.920
a pile of life jackets
of those who had made it to shore.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.416
And when I looked closer,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.896
there were small
life jackets for children,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.296
yellow ones.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.560
And I took this picture.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.616
You probably can't see the writing,
but I want to read it for you.
