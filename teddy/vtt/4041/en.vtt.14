00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.136
but they just don't know whether
there are any solutions to this crisis.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.976
And what I want to tell you today

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.108
is that though the problems are real,
the solutions are real, too.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.136
Solution one:

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.736
these refugees need to get into work
in the countries where they're living,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.016
and the countries where they're living
need massive economic support.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.920
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.576
80 percent of refugees
in the capital city Kampala

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.336
needed no humanitarian aid
because they were working.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.789
They were supported into work.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.176
Solution number two:

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.256
education for kids
is a lifeline, not a luxury,
