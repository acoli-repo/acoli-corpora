00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.000
that the biggest question
in the 21st century

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.800
concerns our duty to strangers.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.576
The future "you" is about your duties

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.800
to strangers.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.816
You know better than anyone,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.640
the world is more connected
than ever before,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.416
yet the great danger

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.959
is that we're consumed by our divisions.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.256
And there is no better test of that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.240
than how we treat refugees.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.776
Here are the facts: 65 million people

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.016
displaced from their homes
by violence and persecution last year.
