00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.240
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.936
off the coast of Italy, in 2014,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.256
he accused all of us
and the global population

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.720
of what he called
"the globalization of indifference."

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.976
It's a haunting phrase.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.440
It means that our hearts
have turned to stone.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.376
Now, I don't know, you tell me.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.280
Are you allowed to argue with the Pope,
even at a TED conference?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.296
But I think it's not right.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.416
I think people do want
to make a difference,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.136
but they just don't know whether
there are any solutions to this crisis.
