00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.336
I'm going to speak to you
about the global refugee crisis

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.176
and my aim is to show you that this crisis

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.800
is manageable, not unsolvable,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.256
but also show you that this is
as much about us and who we are

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.520
as it is a trial of the refugees
on the front line.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.136
For me, this is not
just a professional obligation,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.096
because I run an NGO supporting refugees
and displaced people around the world.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.320
It's personal.
