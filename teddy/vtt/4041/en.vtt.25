Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.400
they've come to the West for safety.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.160
We throw that away at our peril.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.376
And there's one other thing
it reveals about us:

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.734
whether we have any humility
for our own mistakes.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.176
I'm not one of these people

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.536
who believes that all the problems
in the world are caused by the West.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.776
They're not.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.160
But when we make mistakes,
we should recognize it.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.376
It's not an accident
that the country which has taken

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.656
more refugees than any other,
the United States,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.960
has taken more refugees from Vietnam
than any other country.
