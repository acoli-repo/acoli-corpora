00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.600
And it's a reason to help them
because of what it says about us.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.320
It's revealing of our values.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.080
Empathy and altruism are two
of the foundations of civilization.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.736
Turn that empathy and altruism into action

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.000
and we live out a basic moral credo.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.216
And in the modern world,
we have no excuse.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.336
We can't say we don't know
what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.936
or Aleppo, Syria.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.856
It's there, in our smartphone

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.256
in our hand.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.856
Ignorance is no excuse at all.
