The numbers are relatively small,
hundreds of thousands, not millions,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.000
but the symbolism is huge.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.576
Now is not the time
to be banning refugees,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.416
as the Trump administration proposes.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.640
It's a time to be embracing people
who are victims of terror.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.376
And remember --

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.960
(Applause)

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.216
Remember, anyone who asks you,
"Are they properly vetted?"

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.440
that's a really sensible
and good question to ask.
