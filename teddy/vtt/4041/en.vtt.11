00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.536
And naïvely I said to Silo,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760
"Do you think you'll ever
go home to Somalia?"

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.840
And she said, "What do you mean, go home?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.520
I was born here."

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.816
And then when I asked the camp management

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.896
how many of the 330,000 people
in that camp were born there,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.120
they gave me the answer:

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.680
100,000.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.240
That's what long-term displacement means.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.896
Now, the causes of this are deep:

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.159
weak states that can't
support their own people,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.256
an international political system
