00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.416
It shows the lifeless body

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.536
of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.016
a Syrian refugee who died
in the Mediterranean in 2015.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.440
He died alongside 3,700 others
trying to get to Europe.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.000
The next year, 2016,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.080
5,000 people died.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.040
It's too late for them,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.976
but it's not too late
for millions of others.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.048
It's not too late
for people like Frederick.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.136
I met him in the Nyarugusu
refugee camp in Tanzania.
