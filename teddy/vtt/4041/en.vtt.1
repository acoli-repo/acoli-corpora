00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.320
It's personal.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.120
I love this picture.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.016
That really handsome guy on the right,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.240
that's not me.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.336
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.160
with his father Samuel.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.416
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.760
They fled the day the Nazis invaded.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.034
And I love this picture, too.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.800
It's a group of refugee children

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.160
arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.080
And in the middle is my mother, Marion.
