00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.136
I met him in the Nyarugusu
refugee camp in Tanzania.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.360
He's from Burundi.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.296
He wanted to know
where could he complete his studies.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.416
He'd done 11 years of schooling.
He wanted a 12th year.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.056
He said to me, "I pray
that my days do not end here

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.280
in this refugee camp."

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.480
And it's not too late for Halud.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.176
Her parents were Palestinian refugees

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000
living in the Yarmouk refugee camp
outside Damascus.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.006
She was born to refugee parents,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.800
and now she's a refugee
herself in Lebanon.
