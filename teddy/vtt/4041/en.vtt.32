00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.520
and he said, in French,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.576
"On doit."

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.800
"One must."

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.520
It was innate in him.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.376
It was natural.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.616
And my point to you is it should be
natural and innate in us, too.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.840
Tell yourself,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.576
this refugee crisis is manageable,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.176
not unsolvable,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.520
and each one of us

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.216
has a personal responsibility
to help make it so.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.416
Because this is about the rescue
of us and our values

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.296
as well as the rescue
of refugees and their lives.
