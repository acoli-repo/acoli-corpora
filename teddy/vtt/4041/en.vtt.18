00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.416
The truth is, refugees
arriving for resettlement

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.096
are more vetted than any other population
arriving in our countries.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.256
So while it's reasonable
to ask the question,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.160
it's not reasonable to say that refugee
is another word for terrorist.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.336
Now, what happens --

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.736
(Applause)

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.896
What happens when refugees can't get work,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.776
they can't get their kids into school,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.856
they can't get cash,
they can't get a legal route to hope?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.960
What happens is they take risky journeys.
