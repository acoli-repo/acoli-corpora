00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:04.707
I am no designer, nope, no way.

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:06.523
My dad was,

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.115
which is kind of an interesting way to grow up.

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:13.290
I had to figure out what it is my dad did

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.090
and why it was important.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.251
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:23.221
you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:25.684
whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.634
or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.027
or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.
