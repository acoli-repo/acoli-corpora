00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's a great pleasure to speak after

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Brian Cox from CERN.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I think CERN is the home

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Where is the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, the Small Hadron Collider

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,
