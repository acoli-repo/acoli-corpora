00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.405
I'm very pleased to be here today

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.959
to talk to you all about how we might repair

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:06.995
the damaged brain,

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:09.237
and I'm particularly excited by this field,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:11.722
because as a neurologist myself,

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.523
I believe that this offers one of the great ways

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.455
that we might be able to offer hope

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:18.028
for patients who today live with devastating

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:21.986
and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:24.076
So here's the problem.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.876
You can see here the picture of somebody's brain

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.408
with Alzheimer's disease

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:30.327
next to a healthy brain,
