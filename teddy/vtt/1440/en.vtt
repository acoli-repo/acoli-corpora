00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.166
For as long as I can remember,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.396
I have felt a very deep connection
to animals and to the ocean.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.631
And at this age, my personal idol
was Flipper the dolphin.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.109
And when I first learned
about endangered species,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.823
I was truly distressed to know
that every day,

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:23.371
animals were being wiped
off the face of this Earth forever.

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:26.402
And I wanted to do something to help,
but I always wondered:

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.258
What could one person possibly do
to make a difference?
