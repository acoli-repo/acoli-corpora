00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and the phone rang and I heard,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Hey, JR,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you won the TED Prize 2011.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You have to make a wish to save the world."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was lost.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The world is fucked up.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
population is growing by millions,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there's no more fish in the sea,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the North Pole is melting

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we're all becoming fat.
