00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.141
so we're doing fine.

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:02.832
And what we are doing, essentially,

00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:06.641
is just to respond faster
than pretty much anyone.

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:09.260
We started responding last year,

00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:12.624
whereas pretty much everybody else
started responding this year.

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:15.909
We tried to warn the world
last year, but, anyway.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.086
So in any case,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.848
the point here is
that if you start early enough,

00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:23.355
you get to make sure
that the border control

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:28.823
is the main point where you quarantine
all the returning residents and so on,

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:31.786
instead of waiting until
the community spread stage,
