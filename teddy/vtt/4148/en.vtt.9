00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:31.330
our counter-disinformation
strategy is very simple.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.866
It's called "humor over rumor."

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.220
So when there was a panic buying
of tissue paper, for example,

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.680
there was a rumor that says,

00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:40.537
"Oh, we're ramping up mass production,

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:42.474
it's the same material as tissue papers,

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:44.879
and so we'll run out
of tissue paper soon."

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:48.868
And our premier showed
a very memetic picture

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:50.727
that I simply have to share with you.

00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:52.116
In very large print,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.623
he shows his bottom,

00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:56.839
wiggling it a little bit,

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.887
and then the large print says

00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:01.707
"Each of us only have
one pair of buttocks."
