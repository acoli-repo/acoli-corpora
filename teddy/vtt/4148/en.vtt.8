00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:02.955
and that remaining 20 percent of people
were often young, work very long hours,

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.917
when they go off work,
the pharmacies also went off work,

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.184
and so we work with convenience stores

00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.520
so that everybody can collect
their mask anytime,

00:04:10.544 --> 00:04:11.955
24 hours a day.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.737
So we ensure fairness of all kinds,

00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:16.561
based on the digital democracy's feedback.

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.680
And finally, I would like to acknowledge
that this is a very stressful time.

00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:22.998
People feel anxious, outraged,

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:24.467
there's a lot of panic buying,

00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.315
a lot of conspiracy theories
in all economies.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:28.512
And in Taiwan,

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:31.330
our counter-disinformation
strategy is very simple.
