to collect masks from nearby pharmacies,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.291
not only do we publish the stock level
of masks of all pharmacies,

00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:05.481
6,000 of them,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.077
we publish it every 30 seconds.

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:12.092
That's why our civic hackers,
our civil engineers in the digital space,

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:16.250
built more than 100 tools
that enable people to view a map,

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:20.156

inclusive access to information

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.051
about which pharmacies near them
still have masks.

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.789
And because the national
health insurance single payer

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:31.980
is more than 99.9 percent
of health coverage,
