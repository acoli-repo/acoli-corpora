00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.476
it's called listening at scale
for rough consensus.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.040
The second part I already covered
is the distribute ledger,

00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:36.306
where everybody can go
to a nearby pharmacy,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.029
present their NHI card,
buy nine masks, or 10 if you're a child,

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:43.323
and see the stock level
of that pharmacy on their phone

00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:47.029
actually decreasing by nine or 10
in a couple of minutes.

00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:49.141
And if they grow by nine or 10,

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:50.653
of course, you call the 1922,

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.887
and report something fishy is going on.

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:55.241
But this is participatory accountability.

00:11:55.265 --> 00:11:56.998
This is published every 30 seconds.

00:11:57.022 --> 00:11:59.069
So everybody holds each other accountable,

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.196
and that massively increases trust.
