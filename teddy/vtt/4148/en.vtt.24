00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.196
and that massively increases trust.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.557
And finally, the third one,
the humor versus rumor,

00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:07.403
I think the important thing to see here

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.967
is that wherever there's a trending
disinformation or conspiracy theory,

00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.410
you respond to it with a humorous package

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:14.696
within two hours.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.487
We have discovered,
if we respond within two hours,

00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:21.543
then more people see the vaccination
than the conspiracy theory.

00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:25.255
But if you respond four hours
or a day afterwards,

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.472
then that's a lost cause.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.767
You can't really counter that
using humor anymore,

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:33.156
you have to invite the person
who spread those messages
