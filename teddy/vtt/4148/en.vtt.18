And therefore, we have to innovate
of humor versus rumor,

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:04.268
because the easy path,

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.283

Our design criteria,

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:13.132
also prevented us

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:28.529
where your phone is basically connected
to the nearby telecoms,

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:33.347
and they make sure that if they go out
of the 15-meter or so radius,
