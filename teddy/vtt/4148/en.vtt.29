He asks, "What would you rank
the level of trust

00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:33.695
your community had before the pandemic,

00:14:33.719 --> 00:14:35.846
in order for the government
to have a chance

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.337
at properly controlling this crisis?"

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.023
AT: I would say that a community
trusts each other.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.787
And that is the main point
of digital democracy.

00:14:44.811 --> 00:14:47.569
This is not about people
trusting the government more.

00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:50.601
This is about the government
trusting the citizens more,

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:53.093
making the state transparent
to the citizen,

00:14:53.117 --> 00:14:55.101
not the citizen transparent to the state,

00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.807
which would be some other regime.

00:14:56.831 --> 00:14:59.046
So making the state
transparent to the citizens

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.299
doesn't always elicit more trust,
