00:10:26.855 --> 00:10:30.473
which is essentially a forum
that lets you upvote and downvote

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.934
each other's feelings,

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.926
but with real-time clustering,

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.641
so that if you go to cohack.tw,

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:39.732
you see six such conversations,

00:10:39.756 --> 00:10:42.721
talking about how to protect
the most vulnerable people,

00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:44.348
how to make a smooth transition,

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:47.815
how to make a fair
distribution of supplies and so on.

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:50.299
And people are free to voice their ideas,

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:52.625
and upvote and downvote
each other's ideas.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.434
But the trick is that we show people
the main divisive points,

00:10:56.458 --> 00:10:57.958
and the main consensual points,

00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:00.276
and we respond only to the ideas
