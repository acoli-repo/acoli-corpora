is that the rumors seem to travel
faster than any response,

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.645
whether humorous or not.

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.334
How do you defeat that aspect in Taiwan?

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:41.670
AT: Yeah, we found that, of course,

00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:45.340
humor implicitly means
there is a sublimation

00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:48.934
of upsetness, of outrage.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.934
And so as you see, for example,

00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.029

00:06:55.053 --> 00:06:58.849
He doesn't make a joke
at the expense of other people.

00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:00.357
And this was the key.
