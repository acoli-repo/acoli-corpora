It's been like that since late 2016,

00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:35.172
but it's not until our previous
spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka,

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:37.862
joined about a year and a half ago,

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:40.418
do the professional comedians
get to the team.

00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:46.659
Previously, this was more about inviting
the people who post, you know,

00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:51.350
quotes like "Our tax filing system
is explosively hostile,"

00:13:51.374 --> 00:13:52.526
and gets trending,

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.492
and previously, the POs
just invited those people.

00:13:55.516 --> 00:13:57.049
Everybody who complains

00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:59.412
about the finance minister's
tax-filing experience

00:13:59.436 --> 00:14:02.411
gets invited to the cocreation
of that tax filing experience.
