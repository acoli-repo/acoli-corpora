WEBVTT

00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:00.276
and we respond only to the ideas

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.053
that can convince
all the different opinion groups.

00:11:03.077 --> 00:11:07.017
So people are encouraged
to post more eclectic, more nuanced ideas

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.326
and they discover,
at the end of this consultation,

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.684
that everybody, actually,
agrees with most things,

00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:15.406
with most of their neighbors
on most of the issues.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.895
And that is what we call
the social mandate,

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.339
or the democratic mandate,

00:11:19.363 --> 00:11:23.299
that then informs our development
of the counter-coronavirus strategy

00:11:23.323 --> 00:11:25.911
and helping the world with such tools.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.397
And so this is the first part,

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.476
it's called listening at scale
for rough consensus.
