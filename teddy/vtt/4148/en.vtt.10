"Each of us only have
one pair of buttocks."

00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:04.744
And of course, the serious table shows

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:07.704
that tissue paper came
from South American materials,

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:09.950
and medical masks
come from domestic materials,

00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:12.418

00:05:25.815 --> 00:05:28.553
And this is not just
a single shock point in social media.

00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:29.734
Every single day,

00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:31.776
the daily press conference gets translated
