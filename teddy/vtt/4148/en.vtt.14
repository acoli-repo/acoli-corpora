00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:00.357
And this was the key.

00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:02.286
Because people think it hilarious,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.460
they share it,

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:06.428
but with no malicious or toxic intentions.

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.378
People remember the actual payload,

00:07:08.402 --> 00:07:11.355
that table about materials
used to produce masks,

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:12.550
much more easily.

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:16.930
If they make a joke
that excludes parts of the society,

00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:19.550
of course, that part of society
will feel outraged

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:21.907
and we will end up
creating more divisiveness,

00:07:21.931 --> 00:07:24.074
rather than prosocial behavior.

00:07:24.098 --> 00:07:27.410
So the humor at no expense,

00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.144
not excluding any part of society,
