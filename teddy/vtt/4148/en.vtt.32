00:16:02.324 --> 00:16:04.245
that's the key to the response.

00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:08.579
WPR: I will come back shortly
with more questions,

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:11.332
but I'll leave you guys
to continue your conversation.

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:12.823
AT: Awesome.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:16.780
DB: Well, clearly,
part of that trust in government

00:16:16.804 --> 00:16:22.434
was maybe not there in 2014
during the Sunflower Movement.

00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:24.918
So talk to me about that

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:30.028
and how that led to this,
kind of, digital transformation.
