00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.144
not excluding any part of society,

00:07:30.168 --> 00:07:31.835
I think that was the key.

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:35.044
DB: It's also incredible

00:07:35.068 --> 00:07:40.854
because Taiwan has such close ties
to the origin point of this.

00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.045
AT: PRC, yes.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:43.235
DB: The mainland.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.204
So given those close economic ties,

00:07:47.228 --> 00:07:51.021
how do you survive
that kind of disruption?

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:56.425
AT: Yeah, I mean, at this moment,

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:59.887
it's been almost a month now
with no local confirmed cases,

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.141
so we're doing fine.
