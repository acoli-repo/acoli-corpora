00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:31.980
is more than 99.9 percent
of health coverage,

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.458
people who show any symptoms

00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:35.641
will then be able to take
the medical mask,

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:36.950
go to a local clinic,

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:39.205
knowing fully that they will
get treated fairly

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.267
without incurring any financial burden.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.934
And so people designed a dashboard

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.498
that lets everybody see
our supply is indeed growing,

00:03:45.522 --> 00:03:47.752
and whether there's over- or undersupply,

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:50.315
so that we codesign
this distribution system

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.760
with the pharmacies,
with the whole of society.

00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:54.783
So based on this analysis,

00:03:54.807 --> 00:03:58.677
we show that there was
a peak at 70 percent,

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:02.955
and that remaining 20 percent of people
were often young, work very long hours,
