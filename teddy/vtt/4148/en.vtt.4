00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:00.522
but with the emphasis
on keeping an open mind

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:03.395
to novel ideas from the society.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.919
And that is why our schools
and businesses still remain open today,

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:08.172
there was no lockdown,

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:10.751
it's been a month
with no local confirmed cases.

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:12.663
So the fast part.

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:16.268
Every day, our Central Epidemic
Command Center, or CECC,

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.935
holds a press conference,
which is always livestreamed,

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.602
and we work with the journalists,

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:23.037
they answer all the questions
from the journalists,

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.149
and whenever there's a new idea
coming in from the social sector,

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:28.299
anyone can pick up
their phone and call 1922

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.458
and tell that idea to the CECC.
