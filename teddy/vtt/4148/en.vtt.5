00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.458
and tell that idea to the CECC.

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.752
For example, there was one day in April

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:35.744
where a young boy has said
he doesn't want to go to school

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:37.728
because his school mates may laugh at him

00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:40.458
because all he had is a pink medical mask.

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:41.657
The very next day,

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:45.672

started wearing pink medical masks,

00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:48.630
making sure that everybody learns
about gender mainstreaming.

00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:50.670
And so this kind of rapid response system

00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:53.704
builds trust between the government
and the civil society.

00:02:53.728 --> 00:02:55.569
And the second focus is fairness.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.729
Making sure everybody can use
their national health insurance card

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:00.696
to collect masks from nearby pharmacies,
