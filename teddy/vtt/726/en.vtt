00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For years I've been feeling frustrated,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because as a religious historian,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've become acutely aware

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of the centrality of compassion

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in all the major world faiths.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Every single one of them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
has evolved their own version

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of what's been called the Golden Rule.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And equally important
