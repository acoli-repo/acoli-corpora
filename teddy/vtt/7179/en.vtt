[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:08.876
Society has a set
of stories it tells itself

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:12.516
about who refugees are
and what they look like.

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.516
But let me tell you a different story.

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.116
My story.

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.956
I'm a filmmaker and a refugee

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:24.156
from a small village in northern Syria.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:29.676
In our village, growing up,
there was no stable electricity supply.

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:33.356
We spend most of our nights
around gas lanterns
