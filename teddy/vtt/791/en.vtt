00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where we don't have robots everywhere.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Are they going to be around in 50 years?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
