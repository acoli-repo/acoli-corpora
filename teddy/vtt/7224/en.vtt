Lily James Olds: Hi, Katie, welcome.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.516
Katie Mack: Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:06.956
LJO: So happy to have you.

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.996
I would love if, for those of us
who are not astrophysicists,

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:13.476
you could return and help us
give a little refresher

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:17.156
on how the universe did begin
and how we know that.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:18.396
KM: Right, right, yeah.

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:22.236
So we know actually quite a lot
about the early universe,

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.636
about the beginning of the universe,

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.716
because we can actually see it.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:31.876
And this is the wildest part of astronomy,
