00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I thought I would talk about today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is the transition from one mode

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of thinking about nature

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to another that's tracked by architecture. 



00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What's interesting about architects is, 



00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we always have tried to justify beauty 



00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by looking to nature,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and arguably, beautiful architecture 



00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
has always been looking at a model of nature. 



00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, for roughly 300 years, 



00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the hot debate in architecture

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was whether the number five 



00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or the number seven
