00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:03.715
Radical openness is still a distant future

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:06.011
in the field of school education.

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:07.900
We have such a hard time figuring out

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.121
that learning is not a place but an activity.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.592
But I want to tell you the story of PISA,

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:17.970
OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.599
of 15-year-olds around the world,

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.121
and it's really a story of how international comparisons

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.396
have globalized the field of education that we usually treat

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.331
as an affair of domestic policy.
