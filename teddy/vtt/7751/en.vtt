My name, Ndidi, means patience in Igbo.

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:08.463
But I'm probably one of the most impatient
people you've ever met.

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:11.841
I was in such a rush to enter the world

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:13.551
that I was born in the parking lot

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.887
of the University of Nigeria
Teaching Hospital.

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:17.180
True story.

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.350
Agriculture was my favorite
subject in school.

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:24.645
My mom remembers me squealing for joy

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.022
when I ran home from school

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.068
and saw green beans ready for harvesting.
