00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:31.697
But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:35.227
Many believed it was destroyed 
in a catastrophic fire.

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:39.483
The truth of the library’s rise 
and fall is much more complex.

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:42.776
The idea for the library came 
from Alexander the Great.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.038
After establishing himself as a conqueror,

00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:47.846
the former student of Aristotle 
turned his attention

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:52.524
to building an empire of knowledge 
headquartered in his namesake city.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.732
He died before construction began,

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.745
but his successor, Ptolemy I,

00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:01.354
executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library.
