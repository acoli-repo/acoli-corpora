00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:09.119
2,300 years ago,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.801
the rulers of Alexandria 
set out to fulfill

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.196
one of humanity’s most audacious goals:

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:18.590
to collect all the knowledge in the world 
under one roof.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.824
In its prime,

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:23.623
the Library of Alexandria housed 
an unprecedented number of scrolls

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.157
and attracted some of 
the Greek world’s greatest minds.

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:31.697
But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished.
