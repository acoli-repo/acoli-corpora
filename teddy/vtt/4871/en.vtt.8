we’re still grappling 
with the best ways to collect,

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:10.557
access,

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:12.506
and preserve our knowledge.

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:14.737
There’s more information available today

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:17.383
and more advanced technology 
to preserve it,

00:04:17.383 --> 00:04:19.040
though we can’t know for sure

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.487

will be more resistant to destruction

00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:25.790
than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.406
And even if our reservoirs of knowledge 
are physically secure,

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:32.672
they will still have to resist 
the more insidious forces
