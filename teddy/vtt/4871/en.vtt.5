Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of
Cyrene set to work on a solution,

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.851
creating the pinakes,

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:37.238
a 120-volume catalog 
of the library’s contents,

00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:39.307
the first of its kind.

00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:40.745
Using the pinakes,

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.888
others were able to navigate 
the Library’s swelling collection.

00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:46.721
They made some astounding discoveries.

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.414
1,600 years before Columbus set sail,

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:52.732
Eratosthenes not only realized 
the earth was round,

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:55.234
but calculated its circumference 
and diameter

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:57.728
within a few miles of their actual size.

00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.330
Heron of Alexandria created 
the world’s first steam engine
