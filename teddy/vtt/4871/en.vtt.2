00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:01.354
executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library.

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.740
Located in the royal district of the city,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.266
the Library of Alexandria

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.105
may have been built 
with grand Hellenistic columns,

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:09.940
native Egyptian influences,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.061
or a unique blend of the two--there are 
no surviving accounts of its architecture.

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:20.089
We do know it had lecture halls, 
classrooms, and, of course, shelves.

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:21.958
As soon as the building was complete,

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.441
Ptolemy I began to fill it with
primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:30.842
He invited scholars to live 
and study in Alexandria at his expense.
