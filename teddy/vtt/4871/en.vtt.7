00:03:26.827 --> 00:03:30.314
It's possible the fire destroyed 
part of the sprawling collection,

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:32.135
but we know from ancient writings

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:36.661
that scholars continued to visit 
the library for centuries after the siege.

00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:41.235
Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared
as the city changed from Greek,

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:42.266
to Roman,

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:43.172
Christian,

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:45.177
and eventually Muslim hands.

00:03:45.177 --> 00:03:48.323
Each new set of rulers viewed 
its contents as a threat

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:50.786
rather than a source of pride.

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:52.882
In 415 CE,

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:56.288
the Christian rulers even had 
a mathematician named Hypatia

00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:59.956
murdered for studying 
the library’s ancient Greek texts,

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.379
which they viewed as blasphemous.
