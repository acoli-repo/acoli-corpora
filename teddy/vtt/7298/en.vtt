As a girl, I walked along
the shores of Lake Chad,

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.396
one of the largest lakes in Africa.

00:00:07.756 --> 00:00:09.356
It went on forever,

00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:12.316
touching four countries: Chad, Niger,

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:15.116
Cameroon and my own country, Nigeria.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:18.156
It seemed like an ocean to me at the time,

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:21.236
with 30 million people
relying on its bounty.

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:24.156
Sadly, today, as you fly over Lake Chad,

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.796
you won't see much.

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:28.716
It's a fraction of its original size.

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:32.956
Ninety percent of this
fresh water basin has dried up,
