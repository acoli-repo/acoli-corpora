00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All buildings today have something in common.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They're made using Victorian technologies.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This involves blueprints,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
industrial manufacturing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and construction using teams of workers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
All of this effort results in an inert object.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from our environment into our homes and cities.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is not sustainable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities
