00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
You sound very nearby.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The next recording you're going to hear

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
was made of the same humpback song

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
50 miles away.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
That's shown down here.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You only hear the low frequencies.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You hear the reverberation

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and is not quite as loud.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Now after I play back these humpback calls,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
because they're so low in frequency

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.
