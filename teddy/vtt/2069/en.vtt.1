00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what marine mammals have evolved

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
over the last tens of millions of years

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is ways to depend on sound

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to both explore their world

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and also to stay in touch with one another.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They can produce loud clicks

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They can listen for echoes from prey

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in order to decide where food is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and to decide which one they want to eat.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So the large baleen whales

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
will produce long, beautiful songs,
