This means that humpback song

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is a form of animal culture,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
just like music for humans would be.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I think one of the most interesting examples of this

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
comes from Australia.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Biologists on the east coast of Australia

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And this orange line here marks the typical songs

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of east coast humpbacks.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
In '95 they all sang the normal song.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and it turned out that these strange songs

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
were typical of west coast whales.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The west coast calls became more and more popular,
