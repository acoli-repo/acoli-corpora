00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Up high, these variable lines

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
indicate increasing noise in this frequency range

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
from higher wind and wave.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the noise is dominated by human ships.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing:

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
That in this frequency range where whales communicate,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
comes from human ships,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
thousands of human ships, distant, far away,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
just all aggregating.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The next slide will show what the impact this may have

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
on the range at which whales can communicate.
