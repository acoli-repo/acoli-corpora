00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
we can now see a gradual decline

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in this potential problem.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and that's the problem of collision.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This is a whale that just squeaked by

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But collision is a serious problem.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and it's very important to try to reduce this.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'll discuss two very promising approaches.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
