00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
left the area completely.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this means that we have to be

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We may need to regulate the intensity

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of recreational boating and actual whale watching

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in order to prevent these kinds of problems.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'd also like to point out that sound

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
doesn't obey boundaries.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So you can draw a line to try to protect an area,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but chemical pollution and noise pollution
