Many mammals have to produce contact calls

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
when, say, a mother and calf are apart.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
when they're isolated from another one.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And you can see, there's not much

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
variability in these calls.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
By contrast, the signature whistle

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which dolphins use to stay in touch,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
each individual here has a radically different call.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They can use this ability to learn calls

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to identify individuals.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
How about the setting in which animals need to use this call?
