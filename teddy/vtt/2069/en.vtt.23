00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
This is the sound of a ship,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
There's a potential problem that maybe

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
from being able to hear each other.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now this is something that's been known for quite a while.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And on the y-axis

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
by frequency.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
In the low frequencies, this line indicates

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Up high, these variable lines
