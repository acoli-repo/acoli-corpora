00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of the interconnectedness of the ocean

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
comes from an acoustic experiment

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
where oceanographers

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
deployed an underwater loudspeaker

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and played back a sound.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
That same sound

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the same sound.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So we live in a world of satellite communication,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
are used to global communication,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
but it's still amazing to me.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The ocean has properties

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that allow low-frequency sound
