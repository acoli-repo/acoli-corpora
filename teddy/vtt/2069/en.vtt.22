00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
which was distant for the humpback.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
500 miles away.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But you can still hear that faint call.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Let's now switch and think about

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
a potential for human impacts.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
comes from shipping.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
This is the sound of a ship,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.
