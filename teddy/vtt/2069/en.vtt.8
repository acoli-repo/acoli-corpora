00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This plot shows two members of a pair.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
As you can see at the top here,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
they share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They both have that kind of up-sweep.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Whereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And what's happened is

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
they've used this learning process

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It's a very interesting way that they can

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
form a new identifier

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
for the new social group that they've had.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Let's now take a step back

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and see what this message can tell us

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
about protecting dolphins

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from human disturbance.
