00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
How about the setting in which animals need to use this call?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Well let's look at mothers and calves.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In normal life for mother and calf dolphin,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and when they separate

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
they have to get back together again.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in which dolphins whistle,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
against the maximum distance.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
less than half the time they need to use whistles.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Most of the time they can just find each other

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
just by swimming around.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they need to use these individually distinctive whistles
