00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
These black lines mark shipping lanes

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in and out of the Bay of Fundy.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
The colorized area

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
because of the ships moving in this lane.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
It turns out that this lane here

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Well, biologists

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
who couldn't take no for an answer

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
went to the International Maritime Organization

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and petitioned them to say,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Can't you move them over to a place
