00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and it hummed it back to you,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you ought to be pretty surprised.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Very few nonhuman mammals

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
can imitate sounds.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's really important for our music and our language.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
why do they do it?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
A lot of my career has been devoted

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to trying to understand

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
how these animals use their learning,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
use the ability to change what you say

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
based on what you hear

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
in their own communication systems.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Many mammals have to produce contact calls

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
when, say, a mother and calf are apart.
