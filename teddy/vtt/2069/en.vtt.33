00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Can't you move them over to a place

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
where there's less of a risk?"

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
"These are the new lanes."

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The shipping lanes have been moved.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So it's very promising, actually.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
We can be very creative about thinking

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
of different ways to reduce these risks.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Another action which was just taken independently

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
by a shipping company itself

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
The Maersk Line looked at their competition
