00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Unlike fins and blues, which

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
the humpbacked whales congregate

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in local traditional breeding grounds,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
broader-band and more complicated.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So you're listening to the complicated song

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
produced by humpbacks here.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Humpbacks, when they develop

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the ability to sing this song,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
they're listening to other whales

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This means that humpback song
