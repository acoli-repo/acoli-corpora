00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to see what they could hear.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
This is a plot from Christopher Clark

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
who tracked one individual blue whale

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
as it passed by Bermuda,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It was tracked for 43 days,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
swimming 1,700 kilometers,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
or more than 1,000 miles.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This shows us both that the calls

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are detectable over hundreds of miles

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They're ocean-based and scale animals

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
who are communicating over much longer ranges

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
than we had anticipated.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Unlike fins and blues, which
