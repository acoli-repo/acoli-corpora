00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to find each other for mating and they're dispersed,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
imagine the impact this could have

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
on the recovery of endangered populations.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Whales also have contact calls

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
like I described for the dolphins.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I'll play the sound of a contact call used

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
by right whales to stay in touch.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And this is the kind of call that is used by,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
say, right whale mothers and calves

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
as they separate to come back again.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Now imagine -- let's put the ship noise in the picture.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What's a mother to do

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I'll describe a couple strategies.
