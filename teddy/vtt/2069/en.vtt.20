00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The west coast calls became more and more popular,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
until by 1998,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They just sang the cool new west coast song.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's as if some new hit style

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
had completely wiped out

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the old-fashioned style before,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and with no golden oldies stations.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Nobody sang the old ones.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
0.2 miles away from a humpback.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.
