00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from human disturbance.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Anybody looking at this picture

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
will know this dolphin is surrounded,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and clearly his behavior is being disrupted.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
This is a bad situation.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But it turns out that when just a single boat

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is approaching a group of dolphins

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
at a couple hundred meters away,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the dolphins will start whistling,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
wait for the boat to go by,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and then they'll get back to normal business.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the average interval between times

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group
