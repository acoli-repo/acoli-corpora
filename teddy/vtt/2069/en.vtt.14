00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that allow low-frequency sound

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to basically move globally.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's nearly halfway around the globe.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
In the early '70s,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
published a theoretical paper

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
pointing out that it was possible

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that sound could transmit over these large areas,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but very few biologists believed it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It actually turns out, though,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the whales clearly have evolved,
