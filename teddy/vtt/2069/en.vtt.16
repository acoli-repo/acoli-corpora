00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The biologists continued to be skeptical

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
of the long-range communication issue

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
well past the '70s,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
until the end of the Cold War.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
What happened was, during the Cold War,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that they used to track Russian submarines.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
cabled to shore,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
all wired back to a central place that could listen

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to whale bio-acousticians

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to see what they could hear.
