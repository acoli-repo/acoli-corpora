00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is six minutes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to do their normal work.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Lars Bider has done work

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
comparing dolphin behavior and distribution

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
before there were dolphin-watching boats.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
When there was one boat, not much of an impact.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And two boats: When the second boat was added,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
what happened was that some of the dolphins

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
left the area completely.
