00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they need to use these individually distinctive whistles

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to come back together again.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Most of these distinctive signature whistles

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
are quite stereotyped and stable

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
through the life of a dolphin.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But there are some exceptions.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
When a male dolphin leaves Mom,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it will often join up with another male

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and form an alliance, which may last for decades.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
As these two animals form a social bond,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
their distinctive whistles actually converge

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and become very similar.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This plot shows two members of a pair.
