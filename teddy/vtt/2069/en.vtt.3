00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
some visual representations of sounds.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's the first example.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is a plot of frequency against time --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
sort of like musical notation,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and time goes this way.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is a calf in captivity

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
making an imitation

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of that trainer's whistle.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and it hummed it back to you,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you ought to be pretty surprised.
