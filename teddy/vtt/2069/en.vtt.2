WEBVTT

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
will produce long, beautiful songs,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which are used in reproductive advertisement

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for male and females, both to find one another

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and to select a mate.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And mother and young and closely bonded animals

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
use calls to stay in touch with one another,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
so sound is really critical for their lives.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of these underwater animals,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
whose world was so foreign to me,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
was evidence from captive dolphins

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I mentioned I'll use

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
some visual representations of sounds.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's the first example.
