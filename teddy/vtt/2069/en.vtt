00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
on a journey of the underwater acoustic world

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of whales and dolphins.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Since we are such a visual species,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it's hard for us to really understand this,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and hope this can communicate it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But let's also think, as a visual species,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and try to look underwater.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We really can't see very far.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Our vision, which works so well in air,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what marine mammals have evolved
