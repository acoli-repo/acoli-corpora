For example, two people
who are both into scary movies

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:05.004
are probably a better match
than one person who is and one who isn't.

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:06.521
But what about a question like,

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.607
"Do you like to be
the center of attention?"

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.259
If both people in a relationship
are saying yes to this,

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.376
they're going to have massive problems.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.645
We realized this early on,

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.938
and so we decided we needed
a bit more data from each question.

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.725
We had to ask people to specify
not only their own answer,

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.014
but the answer they wanted
from someone else.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:24.539
That worked really well.

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:26.167
But we needed one more dimension.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:28.834
Some questions tell you more
about a person than others.

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:32.253
For example, a question
about politics, something like,
