00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:30.751
you guys satisfied each other
on the second question.

00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:35.017
So your answers were 10 out of 11
equals 91 percent satisfactory to B.

00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:36.192
That's not bad.

00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.723
The final step is to take
these two match percentages

00:05:38.747 --> 00:05:40.613
and get one number for the both of you.

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:43.248
To do this, the algorithm
multiplies your scores,

00:05:43.272 --> 00:05:44.937
then takes the nth root,

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.144
where "n" is the number of questions.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:49.998
Because s, which is the number
of questions in this sample,

00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:51.863
is only 2,

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:55.552
we have: match percentage
equals the square root

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:58.472
of 98 percent times 91 percent.

00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:00.280
That equals 94 percent.
