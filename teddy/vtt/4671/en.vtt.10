00:04:59.223 --> 00:05:00.389
about messiness,

00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:01.763
was very important to you.

00:05:01.787 --> 00:05:04.017
It's worth 50 points and B got that right.

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:06.112
The second question is worth only 1,

00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:08.414
because you said
it was only a little important.

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:09.635
B got that wrong,

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.441
so B's answers were 50
out of 51 possible points.

00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:15.073
That's 98% satisfactory. Pretty good.

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:19.046
The second question the algorithm
looks at is: How much did you satisfy B?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.329
Well, B placed 1 point on your answer
to the messiness question

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:24.306
and 10 on your answer to the second.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:28.132
Of those 11, that's 1 plus 10,
you earned 10 --

00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:30.751
you guys satisfied each other
on the second question.
