For example, a question
about politics, something like,

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.565
"Which is worse:
book burning or flag burning?"

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.399
might reveal more about someone
than their taste in movies.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.042
And it doesn't make sense
to weigh all things equally,

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:41.662
so we added one final data point.

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:43.710
For everything that OkCupid asks you,

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:46.563
you have a chance to tell us
the role it plays in your life.

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:48.906
And this ranges
from irrelevant to mandatory.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:52.668
So now, for every question,
we have three things for our algorithm:

00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:54.044
first, your answer;

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:58.757
second, how you want someone else --
your potential match -- to answer;

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:01.569
and third, how important
the question is to you at all.
