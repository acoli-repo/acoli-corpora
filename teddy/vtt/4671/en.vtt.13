00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.592
like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything.

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:32.454
Intuitively, too, this makes sense.

00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:35.253
Two people satisfying
each other 50 percent

00:06:35.277 --> 00:06:39.229
should be a better match
than two others who satisfy 0 and 100,

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:41.067
because affection needs to be mutual.

00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.582
After adding a little correction
for margin of error,

00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:46.177
in the case where we have
a small number of questions,

00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:47.518
like we do in this example,

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:48.714
we're good to go.

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:50.650
Any time OkCupid matches two people,

00:06:50.674 --> 00:06:52.706
it goes through the steps
we just outlined.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.999
First it collects data about your answers,

00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:58.008
then it compares your choices
and preferences to other people's

00:06:58.032 --> 00:06:59.999
in simple, mathematical ways.
