00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.252
because computers need
everything in numbers.

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:33.679
We at OkCupid decided
on the following scale:

00:04:33.703 --> 00:04:35.649
"Irrelevant" is worth 0.

00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:38.062
"A little important" is worth 1.

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:40.347
"Somewhat important" is worth 10.

00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:42.585
"Very important" is 50.

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:46.221
And "absolutely mandatory" is 250.

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.876
Next, the algorithm makes
two simple calculations.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.146
The first is: How much did
B's answers satisfy you?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.963
That is, how many possible points
did B score on your scale?

00:04:55.987 --> 00:04:59.199
Well, you indicated that B's answer
to the first question,

00:04:59.223 --> 00:05:00.389
about messiness,
