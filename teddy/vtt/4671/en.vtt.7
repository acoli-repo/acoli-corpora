00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.120
Here are our two example questions.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:32.525
The first one, let's say, is,
"How messy are you?"

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.645
And the answer possibilities are:

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.030
very messy, average and very organized.

00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:40.114
And let's say you answered
"very organized,"

00:03:40.138 --> 00:03:42.898
and you'd like someone else
to answer "very organized,"

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.178
and the question is very important to you.

00:03:45.202 --> 00:03:46.694
Basically, you're a neat freak.

00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:49.586
You're neat, you want someone else
to be neat, and that's it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.625
And let's say B is a little bit different.

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.688
He answered "very organized" for himself,

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:56.719
but "average" is OK with him
as an answer from someone else,

00:03:56.743 --> 00:03:59.145
and the question is only
a little important to him.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.062
Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example:
