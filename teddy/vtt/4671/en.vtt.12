00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:00.280
That equals 94 percent.

00:06:00.304 --> 00:06:03.508
That 94 percent is your match
percentage with B.

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:06.775
It's a mathematical expression
of how happy you'd be with each other,

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:07.982
based on what we know.

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:09.792
Now, why does the algorithm multiply,

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:12.585
as opposed to, say, average
the two match scores together,

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:14.279
and do the square-root business?

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:16.832
In general, this formula
is called the geometric mean.

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:19.483
It's a great way to combine
values that have wide ranges

00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:21.422
and represent very different properties.

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:23.859
In other words, it's perfect
for romantic matching.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.130
You've got wide ranges and you've got
tons of different data points,

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.592
like I said, about movies, politics,
religion -- everything.
