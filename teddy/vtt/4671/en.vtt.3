00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.116
was figuring out how to take
something mysterious,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.290
human attraction,

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:34.098
and break it into components
that a computer can work with.

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:36.675
The first thing we needed
to match people up was data,

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:38.691
something for the algorithm to work with.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.873
The best way to get data quickly
from people is to just ask for it.

00:01:41.897 --> 00:01:44.624
So we decided that OkCupid
should ask users questions,

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:47.005
stuff like, "Do you want
to have kids one day?"

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.787
"How often do you brush your teeth?"

00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.203
"Do you like scary movies?"

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.752
And big stuff like,
"Do you believe in God?"

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.907
Now, a lot of the questions
are good for matching like with like,

00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:59.087
that is, when both people
answer the same way.

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.659
For example, two people
who are both into scary movies
