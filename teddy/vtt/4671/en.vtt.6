00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:01.569
and third, how important
the question is to you at all.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.962
With all this information,

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:07.104
OkCupid can figure out
how well two people will get along.

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:10.134
The algorithm crunches the numbers
and gives us a result.

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.310
As a practical example,

00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:13.859
let's look at how we'd match you
with another person.

00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:15.072
Let's call him "B."

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:19.505
Your match percentage with B is based
on questions you've both answered.

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.954
Let's call that set
of common questions "s."

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.908
As a very simple example,
we use a small set "s"

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:26.573
with just two questions in common,

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:28.425
and compute a match from that.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.120
Here are our two example questions.
