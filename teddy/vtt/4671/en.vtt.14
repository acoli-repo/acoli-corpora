This, the ability to take
real-world phenomena

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.385
and make them something
a microchip can understand,

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.686
is, I think, the most important skill
anyone can have these days.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.133
Like you use sentences
to tell a story to a person,

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:13.641
you use algorithms
to tell a story to a computer.

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.382
If you learn the language,
you can go out and tell your stories.

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:19.159
I hope this will help you do that.
