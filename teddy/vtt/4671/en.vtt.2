Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above:

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.005
they are a step-by-step
way to solve a problem,

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:08.447
and as you probably know, computers
excel at step-by-step processes.

00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:10.060
A computer without an algorithm

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.808
is basically an expensive paperweight.

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:15.821
And since computers are such
a pervasive part of everyday life,

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.392
algorithms are everywhere.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.787
The math behind OkCupid's matching
algorithm is surprisingly simple.

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.813
It's just some addition, multiplication,
a little bit of square roots.

00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:27.527
The tricky part in designing it

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.116
was figuring out how to take
something mysterious,
