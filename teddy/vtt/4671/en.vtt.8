00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.062
Let's look at the second question,
from our previous example:

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.142
"Do you like to be
the center of attention?"

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.680
The answers are "yes" and "no."

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.699
You've answered "no," you want
someone else to answer "no,"

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:11.114
and the question is only
a little important to you.

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:12.759
Now B, he's answered "yes."

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:14.559
He wants someone else to answer "no,"

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.857
because he wants the spotlight on him,

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.311
and the question is somewhat
important to him.

00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:21.334
So, let's try to compute all of this.

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:24.475
Our first step is, since we use
computers to do this,

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.366
we need to assign numerical values

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.017
to ideas like "somewhat
important" and "very important,"

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.252
because computers need
everything in numbers.
