As you may expect, we're known
for the analytic approach we take to love.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:32.333
We call it our matching algorithm.

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:34.945
Basically, OkCupid's matching
algorithm helps us decide

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.845
whether two people should go on a date.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.741
We built our entire business around it.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.725
Now, algorithm is a fancy word,

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.234
and people like to drop it
like it's this big thing.

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:45.546
But really, an algorithm
is just a systematic,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.793
step-by-step way to solve a problem.

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:49.994
It doesn't have to be fancy at all.

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:51.169
Here in this lesson,

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:54.201
I'm going to explain how we arrived
at our particular algorithm,

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:55.636
so you can see how it's done.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.594
Now, why are algorithms even important?

00:00:57.618 --> 00:00:59.198
Why does this lesson even exist?

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:02.642
Well, notice one very significant
phrase I used above:
