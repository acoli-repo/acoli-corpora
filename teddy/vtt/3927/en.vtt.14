Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer?

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:07.270
It might free up some parking spots,

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.937
but it will not end terrorism.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.587
Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:16.517
to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.563
and greater civic engagement.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:22.842
And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area

00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:24.017
recently told me,

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.901
people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:31.017
They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer.
