00:00:01.015 --> 00:00:03.039
What do you think when you look at me?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
A woman of faith? An expert?

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:08.674
Maybe even a sister.

00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.678
Or oppressed,

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.213
brainwashed,

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:14.625
a terrorist.

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:19.607
Or just an airport security line delay.

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.080
That one's actually true.

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:23.660
(Laughter)

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.907
If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.051
That's just how the media
has been portraying

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.605
people who look like me.
