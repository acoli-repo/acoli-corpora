So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal.

00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:03.676
So, back to my story.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.400
What happened after 9/11?

00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:08.552
Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home?

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.272
Well, we talked it over,

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:13.985
and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us,

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:17.865
it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids:

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:21.269
one that would control us by fear

00:13:21.293 --> 00:13:24.787
or one where we were practicing
our religion freely.

00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:26.659
So we decided to go to the mosque.

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:29.566
And we put my son in his car seat,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.281
buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque.
