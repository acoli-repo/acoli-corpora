00:10:56.373 --> 00:11:00.765
When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:05.103
between 2001 and 2013,

00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:06.694
it happened three times,

00:11:06.718 --> 00:11:08.943
but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:13.687
It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles.

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:18.699
So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism

00:11:18.723 --> 00:11:20.722
as I would have expected.

00:11:21.218 --> 00:11:25.696
It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.703
eroding the very foundation
of a free society,

00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:33.851
which is rational
and well-informed citizens.
