and beaten in the street.

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:32.980
Mosques were actually firebombed.

00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:34.992
And I thought, we should just stay home.

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:38.525
And yet, something didn't feel right.

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:41.768
Because those people
who attacked our country

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.109
attacked our country.

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:49.417
I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists.

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:51.562
Guess what? So was I.

00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:56.034
And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy.

00:05:58.193 --> 00:06:01.073
I don't mind questions. I love questions.
