00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:32.457
crouched as low as I could go in my seat,

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:37.999
for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.

00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:42.086
We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.879
in what felt like
a completely different world.

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:49.882
And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.603
warnings from national
Muslim organizations

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.558
saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware,"

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:59.428
"Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate."
