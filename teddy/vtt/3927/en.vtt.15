They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer.

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:35.356
And what you find
about the radicalization process

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.003
is it starts online,

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.598
but the first thing that happens

00:07:38.622 --> 00:07:41.616
is the person gets cut off
from their community,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.282
from even their family,

00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:46.074
so that the extremist group
can brainwash them

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:50.396
into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.436
and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.131
are sellouts or apostates.

00:07:57.607 --> 00:07:59.862
So if we want to prevent radicalization,

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:03.284
we have to keep people
going to the mosque.
