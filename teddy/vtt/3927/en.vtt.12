I don't mind questions. I love questions.

00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:03.771
It's the accusations that are tough.

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:07.230
Today we hear people actually
saying things like,

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:11.084
"There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims.

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:12.946
When are we going to get rid of them?"

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:16.716
So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques.

00:06:17.197 --> 00:06:20.255
They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.920
in the body of America.

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:25.205
And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign?

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.847
You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether,

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:34.048
and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance.
