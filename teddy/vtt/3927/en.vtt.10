00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.071
I stayed inside all week.

00:05:02.988 --> 00:05:05.732
And then it was Friday that same week,

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:09.152
the day that Muslims
congregate for worship.

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:14.601
And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday,

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.347
it could be a target."

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:20.163
And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage.

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:23.052
Emotions were so raw, understandably,

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:26.194
and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:29.596
or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.842
and beaten in the street.
