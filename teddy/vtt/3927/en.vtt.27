00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.281
buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque.

00:13:33.305 --> 00:13:37.182
I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.179
and what I saw made me stop.

00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.899
The place was completely full.

00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:45.680
And then the imam made an announcement,

00:13:45.704 --> 00:13:49.970
thanking and welcoming our guests,

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.778
because half the congregation

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.561
were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists,

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.005
people of faith and no faith,

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:03.930
who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us.
