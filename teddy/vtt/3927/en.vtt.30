Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord.

00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:06.402
But I wonder,

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.885
what would you say to those
who might argue

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.666
that you're giving a TED Talk,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.245
you're clearly a deep thinker,

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:14.276
you work at a fancy think tank,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.413
you're an exception, you're not the rule.

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.209
What would you say to those people?

00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.763
Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you,

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.992
I'm completely ordinary.

00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:25.066
I'm not an exception.

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:27.467
My story is not unusual.

00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:30.474
I am as ordinary as they come.
