00:01:55.582 --> 00:02:00.104
I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents.

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:02.864
I wrestled with the Quran.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:07.816
I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.049
and, ultimately, believed.

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:15.868
My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight.

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:20.488
It was a trust and a slow surrender

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:23.525
that deepened with every
reading of the Quran.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.935
Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.104
I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me.
