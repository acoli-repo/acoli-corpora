"If you want to do something about that,

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:33.475
just make money, give the profits to charities."

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:37.244
It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:41.267
I mean, let me clarify something right here.

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:43.872
Companies and investors are not

00:08:43.872 --> 00:08:46.631
singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.

00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.019
They don't have indefinite social obligations,

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.792
and prudent investing and finance theory

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.891
aren't subordinate to sustainability.

00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.547
They're compatible.

00:08:55.547 --> 00:09:00.012
So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.
