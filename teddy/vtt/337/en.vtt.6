and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:07.351
with financial factors into the investment process.

00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:09.479
It means limiting future risk

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.088
by minimizing harm to people and planet,

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.703
and it means providing capital to users

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:18.863
who deploy it towards productive

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.587
and sustainable outcomes.

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:24.751
So if sustainability matters financially today,

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:27.243
and all signs indicate more tomorrow,

00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:30.741
is the private sector paying attention?
