00:09:57.853 --> 00:10:00.969
or at least not exacerbating them?

00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:05.806
What if we work and save and invest,

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.439
only to find that the world we retire into

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:12.165
is more stressed and less secure than it is now?

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:17.037
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?

00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:19.525
Now a fair question might be,

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:21.421
what if all this sustainability risk stuff

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.957
is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,

00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:28.110
something for virtuous consumers

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.066
or lifestyle choice?
