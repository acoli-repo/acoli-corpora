[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax 
and we create a better world for nothing?"]

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.199
Good, you like it. I like it too.

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:37.776
(Laughter)

00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:39.849
I like it because it pokes fun

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.444
at both sides of the climate change issue.

00:11:42.444 --> 00:11:45.788
I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.527
But what I really like about it

00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:50.456
is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,

00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:52.525
which is, "Plan for the future,

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:54.095
because that's where you're going to spend

00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:56.596
the rest of your life."

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:58.955
Thank you.

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:02.100
(Applause)
