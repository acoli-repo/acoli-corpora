00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.026
we have seven billion souls today

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.452
heading to 10 billion

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:04.353
at the end of the century;

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:06.851
we consume natural resources

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.677
faster than they can be replenished;

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:12.114
and the emissions that are mainly responsible

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:16.943
for climate change just keep increasing.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:21.160
Now clearly, these are
environmental and social issues,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.092
but that's not all.

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.064
They're economic issues,

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.800
and that makes them relevant

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.077
to risk and return.
