00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:30.741
is the private sector paying attention?

00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:36.722
Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.

00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:38.288
They started to see sustainability

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.532
not just as important but crucial to business success.

00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:44.946
About 80 percent of global CEOs

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:49.037
see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:51.430
and leading to competitive advantage

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.154
in their industries.

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:56.327
But 93 percent see ESG as the future,

00:03:56.327 --> 00:03:59.376
or as important to the future of their business.

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:02.593
So the views of CEOs are clear.
