00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.507
That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.

00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:33.726
That's the world's largest economy.

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:37.563
That's some serious freaking firepower.

00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:39.612
So we can reconsider

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.535
some of these pressing challenges,

00:09:41.535 --> 00:09:44.049
like fresh water, clean air,

00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:46.074
feeding 10 billion mouths,

00:09:46.074 --> 00:09:47.751
if institutional investors

00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:50.163
integrated ESG into investment.

00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:52.314
What if they used that firepower

00:09:52.314 --> 00:09:54.358
to allocate more of their capital

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:55.771
to companies working the hardest

00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.853
at solving these challenges

00:09:57.853 --> 00:10:00.969
or at least not exacerbating them?
