Now these initiatives create
a more mobile workplace,

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.625
and they reduce our real estate footprint,

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.265
and they yield savings of 23 million dollars

00:04:36.265 --> 00:04:39.265
in operating costs annually,

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:41.101
and avoid the emissions

00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:45.551
of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.584
That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars

00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:50.373
off the road.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.012
So awesome, right?

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:55.976
Another example is Pentair.

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:58.305
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,

00:04:58.305 --> 00:04:59.885
and about a decade ago,

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.372
they sold their core power tools business
