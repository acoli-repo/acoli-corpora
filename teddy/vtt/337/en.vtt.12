00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:00.145
rated as having the best ESG performance.

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:04.396
Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:08.807
So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.

00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:11.370
In some cases, there may be outperformance

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.953
from ESG.

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:16.131
In blue, we see the performance

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.546
of the 500 largest global companies,

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:21.859
and in gold, we see a subset of companies

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:24.682
with best practice in climate change strategy

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.115
and risk management.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.545
Now over almost eight years,

00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:30.555
they've outperformed by about two thirds.
