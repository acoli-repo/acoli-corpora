00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.066
or lifestyle choice?

00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:32.805
Well, President John F. Kennedy said something

00:10:32.805 --> 00:10:36.290
about this that is just spot on:

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.102
"There are risks and costs to a program of action,

00:10:40.102 --> 00:10:42.751
but they are far less than the long-range risks

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:47.366
and costs of comfortable inaction."

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:50.984
I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.619
but since this is based on
widespread scientific consensus,

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.180
the odds that it's not completely wrong

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.796
are better than the odds

00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.471
that our house will burn down
