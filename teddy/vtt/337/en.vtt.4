00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.301
metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:07.713
valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:10.040
And these things are fundamental, of course,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.805
but they're not enough.

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:14.254
Investors should also look at performance metrics

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:16.178
in what we call ESG:

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.020
environment, social and governance.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.782
Environment includes energy consumption,

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:29.166
water availability, waste and pollution,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.985
just making efficient uses of resources.
