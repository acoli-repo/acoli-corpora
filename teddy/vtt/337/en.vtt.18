00:08:55.547 --> 00:09:00.012
So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.

00:09:00.012 --> 00:09:01.989
But institutional investors

00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:05.155
are the x-factor in sustainability.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:07.218
Why do they hold the key?

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:10.933
The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:13.619
(Laughter)

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.015
A lot of it.

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:17.757
I mean, a really lot of it.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.600
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.658
The global bond market, 78 trillion.

00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:28.836
That's 133 trillion combined.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.507
That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
