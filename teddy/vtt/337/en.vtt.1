00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.663
And here's something that may surprise you:

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:35.334
the balance of power to really influence sustainability

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.489
rests with institutional investors,

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.525
the large investors like pension funds,

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.481
foundations and endowments.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.075
I believe that sustainable investing

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:47.725
is less complicated than you think,

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.753
better-performing than you believe,

00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:52.626
and more important than we can imagine.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.634
Let me remind you what we already know.

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:59.180
We have a population that's both growing and aging;

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.026
we have seven billion souls today
