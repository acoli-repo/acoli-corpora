00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.016
and people around the world will make

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.336
next time they encounter an injustice

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.640
and develop the courage to confront it.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.816
If we do not lift up the women who played

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.800
we fail to offer up role models

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.256
Without role models, it becomes harder

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.296
for women to take up their rightful space

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.520
in public life.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.456
And as we saw earlier,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.296
one of the most critical variables

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.496
in determining whether
a movement will be successful or not
