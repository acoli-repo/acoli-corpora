In the late 1980s,
an uprising started in Gaza,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.360
and quickly spread to the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.616
It came to be known as the First Intifada,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.976
and people who have
any visual memory of it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.800
generally conjure up something like this:

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.640
Palestinian men
throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.296
The news coverage at the time

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.056
made it seem like stones,
Molotov cocktails and burning tires

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.120
were the only activities
taking place in the Intifada.
