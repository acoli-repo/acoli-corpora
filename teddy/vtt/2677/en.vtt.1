We feel much the same way
about other conflicts around the world.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.296
But every time we turn
our attention to the news,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.280
it seems like one more country
has gone up in flames.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.016
So I've been wondering

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.360
whether we should not start
looking at conflict in a different way --

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.136
whether instead of simply
wishing to end conflict,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.176
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.256
This has been a big question for me,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.920
one I've pursued together with my team
at the nonprofit Just Vision.
