00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.056
Twelve years ago, I picked up
a camera for the first time

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.200
to film the olive harvest
in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.296
I thought I was there
to make a single documentary

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.176
and would then move on
to some other part of the world.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.480
But something kept bringing me back.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.296
Now, usually, when international audiences
hear about that part of the world,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.856
they often just want
that conflict to go away.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.520
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
and we wish it could just disappear.
