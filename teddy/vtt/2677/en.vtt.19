Despite their extraordinary achievements,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.200
none of these women have made it
into our narrative of the First Intifada.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.000
We do this in other parts
of the globe, too.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.016
In our history books, for instance,
and in our collective consciousness,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.096
men are the public faces and spokespersons

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.200
for the 1960s struggle
for racial justice in the United States.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.856
But women were also
a critical driving force,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.960
mobilizing, organizing,
taking to the streets.
