00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.456
Having had to navigate
being in the less powerful position

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.216
in multiple aspects of their lives,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.576
women are often more adept

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.856
at how to surreptitiously
pressure for change

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.616
against large, powerful actors.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.816
The term "manipulative," often charged
against women in a derogatory way,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.816
reflects a reality in which women
have often had to find ways

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.240
other than direct confrontation
to achieve their goals.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.976
And finding alternatives
to direct confrontation

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.080
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.
