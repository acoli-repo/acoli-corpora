00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.336
How many of us think of Septima Clark

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.960
when we think of the United States
Civil Rights era?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.280
Remarkably few.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.216
But she played a crucial role
in every phase of the struggle,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.896
particularly by emphasizing
literacy and education.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.416
She's been omitted, ignored,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.136
like so many other women
who played critical roles

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.200
in the United States
Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.000
This is not about getting credit.
