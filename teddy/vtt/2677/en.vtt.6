00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.096
When a movement includes in its discourse

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.856
language around gender equality,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.216
it increases dramatically
the chances it will adopt nonviolence,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.560
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.056
The research squared up
with my own documentation

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.416
of political organizing
in Israel and Palestine.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.856
I've noticed that movements which
welcome women into leadership positions,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.176
such as the one I documented
in a village called Budrus,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.
