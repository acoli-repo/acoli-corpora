00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.936
This village was under a real threat
of being wiped off the map

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.800
when Israel started building
the separation barrier.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.416
The proposed route would require

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.936
the destruction of this community's
olive groves, their cemeteries

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800
and would ultimately
enclose the village from all sides.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.536
Through inspired local leadership,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.200
they launched a nonviolent resistance
campaign to stop that from happening.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.520
The odds were massively
stacked against them.
