00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.936
In a study of 323
major political conflicts

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.936
from 1900 to 2006,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.256
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
found that nonviolent campaigns

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.520
were almost 100 percent more likely
to lead to success than violent campaigns.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.376
Nonviolent campaigns are also
less likely to cause physical harm

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.336
to those waging the campaign,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.496
as well as their opponents.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.400
And, critically, they typically lead
to more peaceful and democratic societies.
