Two weeks ago,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.936
I was sitting at the kitchen table
with my wife Katya,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.720
and we were talking about
what I was going to talk about today.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.696
We have an 11-year-old son;
his name is Lincoln.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.200
He was sitting at the same table,
doing his math homework.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.816
And during a pause
in my conversation with Katya,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.576
I looked over at Lincoln

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.560
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.474
by a recollection of a client of mine.
