The career that I started early on in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and high deserts and low deserts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,
