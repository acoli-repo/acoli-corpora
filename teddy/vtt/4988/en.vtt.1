00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:31.003
totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests.

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:34.161
A man walks into the hotel
and asks for a room.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:35.444
Rather than turn him down,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.907
the night manager decides
to make room for him.

00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:38.947
How?

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.635
Easy, he asks the guest in room number 1

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.711
to move to room 2,

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:46.056
the guest in room 2 to move to room 3,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.138
and so on.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.838
Every guest moves from room number "n"

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:52.179
to room number "n+1".

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.812
Since there are an infinite
number of rooms,

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:57.009
there is a new room
for each existing guest.

00:00:57.413 --> 00:00:59.760
This leaves room 1 open
for the new customer.

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.070
The process can be repeated
