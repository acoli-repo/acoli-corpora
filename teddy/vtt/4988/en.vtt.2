00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.070
The process can be repeated

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.511
for any finite number of new guests.

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:07.529
If, say, a tour bus unloads
40 new people looking for rooms,

00:01:07.553 --> 00:01:09.642
then every existing guest just moves

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.980
from room number "n"

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.638
to room number "n+40",

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:16.200
thus, opening up the first 40 rooms.

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:19.171
But now an infinitely large bus

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:21.744
with a countably infinite
number of passengers

00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:23.673
pulls up to rent rooms.

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:25.686
countably infinite is the key.

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:28.530
Now, the infinite bus
of infinite passengers

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.518
perplexes the night manager at first,
