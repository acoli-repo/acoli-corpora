raised to the power
of their current room number.

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.535
So, the current occupant of room number 7

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.541
goes to room number 2^7,

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:09.261
which is room 128.

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:13.757

00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.806
and assigns them to the room number

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.291
of the next prime, 3,

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:21.728
raised to the power of their seat
number on the bus.

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:25.259
So, the person in seat
number 7 on the first bus

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:28.360
goes to room number 3^7

00:03:28.384 --> 00:03:31.610
