00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.513
mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers,

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:36.594
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:40.513
Georg Cantor called this level
of infinity aleph-zero.

00:04:40.945 --> 00:04:43.042
We use natural numbers
for the room numbers

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.188
as well as the seat numbers on the buses.

00:04:45.913 --> 00:04:48.252
If we were dealing
with higher orders of infinity,

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:49.848
such as that of the real numbers,

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.844
these structured strategies
would no longer be possible

00:04:52.868 --> 00:04:56.405
as we have no way
to systematically include every number.

00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:58.803
The Real Number Infinite Hotel

00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:00.905
has negative number rooms in the basement,
