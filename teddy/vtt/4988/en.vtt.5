00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.329
each with a countably infinite
number of passengers.

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:31.386
What can he do?

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.207
If he cannot find rooms for them,
the hotel will lose out

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.958
on an infinite amount of money,

00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:37.955
and he will surely lose his job.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.790
Luckily, he remembers
that around the year 300 B.C.E.,

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.726
Euclid proved that there
is an infinite quantity

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.634
of prime numbers.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.660
So, to accomplish this
seemingly impossible task

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:52.285
of finding infinite beds
for infinite buses

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.291
of infinite weary travelers,

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.182
the night manager assigns
every current guest

00:02:57.206 --> 00:02:59.042
to the first prime number, 2,

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.867
raised to the power
of their current room number.
