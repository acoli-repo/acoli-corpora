00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.518
perplexes the night manager at first,

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:32.010
but he realizes there's a way

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:33.349
to place each new person.

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:36.391
He asks the guest in room 1
to move to room 2.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:38.527
He then asks the guest in room 2

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.435
to move to room 4,

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.809
the guest in room 3 to move to room 6,

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.105
and so on.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:47.313
Each current guest moves
from room number "n"

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:49.029
to room number "2n" --

00:01:50.807 --> 00:01:54.060
filling up only the infinite
even-numbered rooms.

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:55.929
By doing this, he has now emptied

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:58.867
all of the infinitely many
odd-numbered rooms,

00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.506
which are then taken by the people
filing off the infinite bus.
