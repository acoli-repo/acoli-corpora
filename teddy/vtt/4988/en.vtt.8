00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.846
using unique room-assignment schemes

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.486
based on unique prime numbers.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.701
In this way, the night
manager can accommodate

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.846
every passenger on every bus.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.064
Although, there will be
many rooms that go unfilled,

00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:12.356
like room 6,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.095
since 6 is not a power
of any prime number.

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.512
Luckily, his bosses
weren't very good in math,

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:18.875
so his job is safe.

00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:22.007
The night manager's strategies
are only possible

00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.624
because while the Infinite Hotel
is certainly a logistical nightmare,

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:29.957
it only deals with the lowest
level of infinity,

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.513
mainly, the countable infinity
of the natural numbers,
