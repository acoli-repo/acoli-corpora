WEBVTT

00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:00.905
has negative number rooms in the basement,

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:02.364
fractional rooms,

00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:04.484
so the guy in room 1/2 always suspects

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:07.181
he has less room than the guy in room 1.

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:10.308
Square root rooms, like room radical 2,

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:11.438
and room pi,

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:14.325
where the guests expect free dessert.

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.374
What self-respecting night manager
would ever want to work there

00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:19.005
even for an infinite salary?

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.918
But over at Hilbert's Infinite Hotel,

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:22.420
where there's never any vacancy

00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:24.004
and always room for more,

00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:26.926
the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.760
and maybe too hospitable night manager

00:05:28.784 --> 00:05:31.490
serve to remind us of just how hard it is
