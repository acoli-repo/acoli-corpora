In the 1920's,

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:10.184
the German mathematician David Hilbert

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:12.437
devised a famous thought experiment

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.191
to show us just how hard it is

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:17.665
to wrap our minds
around the concept of infinity.

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:21.659
Imagine a hotel with an infinite
number of rooms

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.988
and a very hardworking night manager.

00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:27.523
One night, the Infinite Hotel
is completely full,

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:31.003
totally booked up
with an infinite number of guests.
