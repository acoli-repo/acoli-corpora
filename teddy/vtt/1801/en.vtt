Steve Ramirez: My first
year of grad school,

00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:03.907
I found myself in my bedroom

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.207
eating lots of Ben &amp; Jerry's

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.891

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:12.859
I had just gone through a breakup.

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.306

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.811

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:25.344
visceral "blah" feeling.

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:27.627
Now, as it turns out,
I'm a neuroscientist,

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.029
so I knew that the memory of that person
