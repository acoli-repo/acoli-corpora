00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:02.665
I want to try and persuade you

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:07.962
that there are reasons why
we should be optimistic in general.

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:11.174
And thatâ€™s a very difficult
thing to do today

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:16.763
because we are confronting
tremendous problems in this world.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:20.224
Things like global climate change,

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.852
which seem almost impossible to solve,

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:24.437
or social inequality,

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:28.357
which seems endemic
and difficult to eliminate.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.693
The scale of these problems though
