00:11:28.234 --> 00:11:30.721
in which they pay attention
to the attitudes of those

00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.252
with whom they are speaking.

00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:33.710
They have culture.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.501
They have a material culture,
a social culture.

00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:38.916
They have a symbolic culture.

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:42.817
Scientists in the Taï Forests
in the Ivory Coast

00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:46.346
found chimpanzees who were using
these rocks to smash open

00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:49.132
the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.

00:11:49.132 --> 00:11:51.431
It takes a long time
to learn how to do that,

00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:53.544
and they excavated the area
and they found

00:11:53.544 --> 00:11:56.377
that this material culture,
this way of doing it,

00:11:56.377 --> 00:11:59.720
these rocks, had passed down
for at least 4,300 years

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.712
through 225 chimpanzee generations.
