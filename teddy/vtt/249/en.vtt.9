00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:33.240
So what we had to do in order
to begin was not only

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.922
to write law review articles
and teach classes, write books,

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:40.890
but we had to then begin
to get down to the nuts and bolts

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.875
of how you litigate that kind of case.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:46.908
So one of the first things we needed to do
was figure out what a cause of action was,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:48.367
a legal cause of action.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:51.264
And a legal cause of action
is a vehicle that lawyers use

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:56.840
to put their arguments in front of courts.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.744
It turns out there's
a very interesting case

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:04.348
that had occurred almost 250 years ago
in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,
