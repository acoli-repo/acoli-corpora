00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.420
The photographs are taken by a man
named James Mollison

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.464
who wrote a book called
"James &amp; Other Apes."

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:39.227
And he tells in his book
how every single one them,

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:41.525
almost every one of them, is an orphan

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:45.140
who saw his mother and father
die before his eyes.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.748
They're legal things.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.441
So for centuries, there's been
a great legal wall

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.785
that separates legal things
from legal persons.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.570
On one hand, legal things
are invisible to judges.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.520
They don't count in law.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.215
They don't have any legal rights.
