I'd like to have you look at this pencil.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.407
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:09.379
And so are books you might have
or the cars you own.

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.258
They're all legal things.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.881
The great apes that you'll see behind me,

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.549
they too are legal things.

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:23.822
Now, I can do that to a legal thing.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:26.631
I can do whatever I want
to my book or my car.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.533
These great apes, you'll see.
