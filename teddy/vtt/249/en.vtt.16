00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.330
but as far as the law was concerned,
they had nothing whatsoever in common.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.740
The next thing we did is that
the Nonhuman Rights Project,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.250
which I founded, then began to look at
what kind of values and principles

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.128
do we want to put before the judges?

00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:16.007
What values and principles
did they imbibe with their mother's milk,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:19.090
were they taught in law school,
do they use every day,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.779
do they believe with all their hearts --
and we chose liberty and equality.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:25.811
Now, liberty right is the kind of right
to which you're entitled


00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.152
because of how you're put together,

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:33.489
and a fundamental liberty right
protects a fundamental interest.
