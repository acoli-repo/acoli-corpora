00:05:55.641 --> 00:06:00.313
We don't know exactly what happened,
but then James dropped out of sight.

00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:03.309
An enraged Charles Stewart
then hired slave catchers

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.550
to canvass the city of London,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.150
find him, bring him
not back to Charles Stewart,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.173
but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,
that was floating in London Harbour,

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.793
and he was chained to the deck,

00:06:15.793 --> 00:06:17.797
and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica

00:06:17.797 --> 00:06:20.816
where James was to be sold
in the slave markets

00:06:20.816 --> 00:06:24.299
and be doomed to the three to five
years of life that a slave had

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.150
harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.359
Well now James' godparents
swung into action.
