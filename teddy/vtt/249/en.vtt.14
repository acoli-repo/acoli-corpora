00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.263
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:03.701
The detainer is required
to bring the detainee in

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:09.576
and give a legally sufficient reason
for depriving him of his bodily liberty.

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:14.570
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make
a decision right off the bat,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.354
because if James Somerset
was a legal thing,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.419
he was not eligible
for a writ of habeus corpus,

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.439
only if he could be a legal person.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.457
So Lord Mansfield decided
that he would assume,

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:29.560
without deciding, that James Somerset
was indeed a legal person,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.971
and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,
and James's body was brought in
