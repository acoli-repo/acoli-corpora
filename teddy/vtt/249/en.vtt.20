00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.582
have studied chimpanzees
intensively for decades.

00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:05.158
We know the extraordinary
cognitive capabilities that they have,

00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:08.292
and they also resemble the kind
that human beings have.

00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:13.424
And so we chose chimpanzees,
and we began to then canvass the world

00:10:13.424 --> 00:10:16.256
to find the experts
in chimpanzee cognition.

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:20.761
We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,
Scotland, England and the United States,

00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.524
and amongst them, they wrote
100 pages of affidavits

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:26.320
in which they set out more than 40 ways

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120
in which their complex
cognitive capability,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.140
either individually or together,
