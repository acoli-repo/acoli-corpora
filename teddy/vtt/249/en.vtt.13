00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.359
Well now James' godparents
swung into action.

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:32.866
They approached the most powerful judge,

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:36.512
Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge
of the court of King's Bench,

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.157
and they demanded that he issue
a common law writ of habeus corpus

00:06:40.157 --> 00:06:41.991
on behalf of James Somerset.

00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.962
Now, the common law is the kind of law
that English-speaking judges can make

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:50.099
when they're not cabined in
by statutes or constitutions,

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.695
and a writ of habeus corpus
is called the Great Writ,

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:54.762
capital G, capital W,

00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:59.290
and it's meant to protect any of us
who are detained against our will.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.263
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.
