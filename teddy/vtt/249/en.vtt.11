00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:32.102
Now, 20 years later, Stewart
brought James Somerset to London,

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:35.980
and after he got there, James decided
he was going to escape.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.620
And so one of the first things he did
was to get himself baptized,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.901
because he wanted to get
a set of godparents,

00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:43.712
because to an 18th-century slave,

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:46.870
they knew that one of the major
responsibilities of godfathers

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.982
was to help you escape.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:52.998
And so in the fall of 1771,

00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:55.641
James Somerset had a confrontation
with Charles Stewart.

00:05:55.641 --> 00:06:00.313
We don't know exactly what happened,
but then James dropped out of sight.
