00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:31.697
all the animals whose interests
I was trying to defend,

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:34.182
were legal things; they were invisible.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:36.102
It was not going to work, so I decided

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:40.066
that the only thing that was going to work
was they had, at least some of them,

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:43.864
had to also be moved through a hole
that we could open up again in that wall

00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:47.440
and begin feeding the appropriate
nonhuman animals through that hole

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.986
onto the other side
of being legal persons.

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:56.426
Now, at that time, there was
very little known about or spoken about

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:58.794
truly animal rights,

00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:03.235
about the idea of having legal personhood
or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,
