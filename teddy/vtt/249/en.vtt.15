and James's body was brought in

00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:34.482

over the next six months.

00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:43.011
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield
said that slavery was so odious,

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.845
and he used the word "odious,"

00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:48.723
that the common law would not support it,
and he ordered James free.

00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:52.313

out of the courtroom

00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:57.191
looked exactly like the slave
who had walked in,

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.330
but as far as the law was concerned,
they had nothing whatsoever in common.
