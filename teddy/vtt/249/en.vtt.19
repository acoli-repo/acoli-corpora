00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:30.435
The Nonhuman Rights Project
argues that drawing a line

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:33.742
in order to enslave an autonomous
and self-determining being

00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:35.530
like you're seeing behind me,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.560
that that's a violation of equality.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.820
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.065
it took us seven years,
to find the jurisdiction

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:46.271
where we wanted to begin
filing our first suit.

00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:47.770
We chose the state of New York.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.392
Then we decided upon
who our plaintiffs are going to be.

00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:52.258
We decided upon chimpanzees,

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.109
not just because Jane Goodall
was on our board of directors,

00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:58.862
but because they, Jane and others,

00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.582
have studied chimpanzees
intensively for decades.
