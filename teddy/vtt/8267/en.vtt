00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:01.122
For so many of us,

00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:02.749
myself included,

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:05.960
our days feel filled
with a million small interruptions.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.629
And this is true even of our days off.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.758
Maybe you've taken a call at the beach,

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:13.926
texted your boss from the grocery store

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:16.721
or emailed a colleague
while on a picnic with your family.

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.725
Weâ€™ve convinced ourselves
that these behaviors are no big deal.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.560
It's just one email.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:26.105
But there's a real cost
to these interruptions,

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.941
and there are smart strategies
we can all take

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:30.860
to better protect our time.
