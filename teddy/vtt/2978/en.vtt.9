Imagine, for a moment, if we can
crowdsource information from all of them

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.681
to help people like Adriana
and her children

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.198
to find safe and reliable paths.

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:41.613
This information
can not only be used for that.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.675
This information can also help them
to become more productive.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.509
Farmers will be able to find

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:52.546
which lands have been cleared
from explosive devices,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.833
and in that way, they will be able
to find new, fertile grounds

00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.284
to start growing food again.
