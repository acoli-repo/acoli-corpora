00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.648
And I have to admit
that for almost 30 years,

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:05.631
I was getting used to it, you know?

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:10.159
But something changed for me
when I met my wife.

00:02:10.614 --> 00:02:12.449
She is a political scientist

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:15.583
completely passionate
about the Colombian armed conflict.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.044
She helped me to understand

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:22.440
how deeply our country has
been affected by land mines and by war.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.759
We decided to come here
to the United States

00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:27.831
in search of new skills

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:32.085
that would enable us to contribute
in a fair way to our society,
