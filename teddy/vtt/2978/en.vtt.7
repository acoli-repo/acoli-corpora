00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:30.744
But what happens when a conflict
that involved land mines

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:32.076
comes to an end?

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:34.965
There are two consequences.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.648
On the one hand,

00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:41.360
the internally displaced population
will start returning to their lands,

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:43.232
and on the other hand,

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.891
hidden land mines are going
to start exploding more often

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.303
on the civilian side.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.803
That's the reason why I decided to join

00:03:51.827 --> 00:03:54.414
the Computer Science Department at NYU,

00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:57.127
along with Professor Claudio Silva

00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.868
to start to develop an app
called MineSafe.
