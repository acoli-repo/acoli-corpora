00:05:01.212 --> 00:05:04.555
MineSafe has now a partnership
with the Colombian government

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:06.372
for the initial pilot,

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:10.634
and we have now some connections
with Cambodia and Somalia as well.

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:13.889
This project is being funded
by private money

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.835
here in the United States,

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:17.684
but we don't want to stop here.

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:19.232
We want to go big,

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:22.579
and we want to scale the project
to every single place

00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:24.349
where land mines are still a threat.

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.231
The Colombian armed conflict
is finally coming to an end,
