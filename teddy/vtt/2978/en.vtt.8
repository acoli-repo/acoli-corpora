MineSafe uses information
from the community

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.871
to suggest paths that have been declared
as the most transited

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:14.529
without accident or incident

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:21.974
the top priority zones to be de-mined.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:28.047
