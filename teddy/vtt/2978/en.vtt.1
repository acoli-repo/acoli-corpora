00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.505
buried throughout the countryside,

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.687
affecting more than one third
of the Colombian population.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.430
These anti-personnel mines

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:42.456
are designed to maim,
not to kill their targets.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.170
The logic behind this, which is awful,

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:51.770
is that more resources are taken up
caring for an injured soldier

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:54.111
than dealing with a person
who has been killed.

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.791
I met Adriana Rodriguez
about five years ago

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:02.082
while I was working
for the Colombian government
