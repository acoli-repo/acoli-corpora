00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So beyond simple play,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
littleBits allow you to program

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
using very simple intuitive gestures.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So to make this blink faster or slower,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
you would just turn this knob

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and basically make it pulse faster or slower.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The idea behind littleBits

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is that it's a growing library.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We want to make every single interaction in the world

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
into a ready-to-use brick.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
everything should be accessible.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
