00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that's afraid of the dark.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
electronics became just another material.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So littleBits is open-source.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We want to encourage a world

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of creators, of inventors, of contributors,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because this world that we live in,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
this interactive world, is ours.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So go ahead and start inventing.
