00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you can make light.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can put a knob in between

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and now you've made a little dimmer.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Switch out the knob

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
for a pulse module,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
which is here,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and now you've made a little blinker.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Add this buzzer

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for some extra punch

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and you've created a noise machine.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm going to stop that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So beyond simple play,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
