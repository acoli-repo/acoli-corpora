00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the building block of our time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
LEGO came up with this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in a few short years,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
LEGO bricks took place in every household.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You don't have to be an engineer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
LEGO made it accessible.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and made it into the building block

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of our imagination.
