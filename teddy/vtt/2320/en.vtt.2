00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and made it into the building block

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of our imagination.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Meanwhile the exact same year,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the next building block.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The transistor was a small plastic unit

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that would take us from a world

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of static bricks piled on top of each other

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to a world where everything was interactive.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Like the concrete block,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the transistor allows you to build

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But there's a main difference:

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The transistor was only for experts.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I personally don't accept this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that the building block of our time
