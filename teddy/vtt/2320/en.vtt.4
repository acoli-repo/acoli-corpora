00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They're pre-engineered

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to be light, sound,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
motors and sensors.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And the best part about it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is they snap together with magnets.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So you can't put them the wrong way.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The bricks are color-coded.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Green is output, blue is power,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
pink is input and orange is wire.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You put a blue to a green,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you can make light.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can put a knob in between
