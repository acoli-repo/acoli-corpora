00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I personally don't accept this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that the building block of our time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is reserved for experts,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so I decided to change that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I started exploring this idea

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of how to put the power of engineers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the hands of artists and designers.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let me show you how they work.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
LittleBits are electronic modules

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with each one specific function.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They're pre-engineered

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to be light, sound,
