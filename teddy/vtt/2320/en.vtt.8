00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we have Geordie making ...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
(Clanging)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Buzzing)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and gave them to some designers

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
with no experience in engineering whatsoever --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Here's an example of a project they made,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
a motion-activated confetti canon ball.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's a lobster made of playdough
