00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And it's been an incredible experience.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The nicest thing is how they start to understand

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the electronics around them from everyday

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that they don't learn at schools.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
For example, how a nightlight works,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
or why an elevator door stays open,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or how an iPod responds to touch.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So for example, we've had designers

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
with no experience with electronics whatsoever

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
start to play with littleBits as a material.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we have Geordie making ...
