This may sound strange,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a very simple idea:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
modules made of cement of a fixed measurement

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that fit together.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Very quickly concrete blocks became

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the most-used construction unit in the world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
buildings, bridges,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
one brick at a time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Essentially concrete blocks had become

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the building block of our time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,
