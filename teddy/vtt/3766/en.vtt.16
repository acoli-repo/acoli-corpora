He learned war like he could
read his way home.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.624
When other men returned,
they would put their weapons out to rest,

00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:08.275
but he brought the lenses
and the cameras home with him.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.362
Opened a shop, turned it
into a family affair.

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:14.806
My father was born into this
world of black and white.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.000
His basketball hands learned
the tiny clicks and slides

00:08:18.024 --> 00:08:20.595

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.096

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.944
His father knew the equipment
but not the art.

00:08:25.308 --> 00:08:27.151
He knew the darks but not the brights.

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:30.850
My father learned the magic,
spent his time following light.
