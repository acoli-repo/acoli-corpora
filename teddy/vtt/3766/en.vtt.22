And on Wooster Street, in a building
with the creaky hallways

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:04.760
and the loft with the 12-foot ceilings

00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.752
and the darkroom with too many sinks

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:09.298
under the color-balanced lights,
she found a note,

00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:13.575
tacked to the wall with a thumb-tack,
left over from a time before towers,

00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:16.564
from the time before babies.

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:21.520
And the note said: "A guy sure loves
the girl who works in the darkroom."

00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:25.710

picked up a camera again.

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:28.776
His first time out, he followed
the Christmas lights,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.283
dotting their way through
New York City's trees,
