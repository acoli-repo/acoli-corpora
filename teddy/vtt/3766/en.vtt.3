00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.930
How many galaxies
are we losing per second?

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.004
How long before next rocket
can be launched?

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.899
Somewhere an electron
flies off its energy cloud.

00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:38.889
A black hole has erupted.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:41.214
A mother finishes setting
the table for dinner.

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:43.299
A Law &amp; Order marathon is starting.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:45.544
The astronaut is asleep.

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:47.471
He has forgotten to turn off his watch,

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.246
which ticks, like a metal
pulse against his wrist.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.845
He does not hear it.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.918
He dreams of coral reefs and plankton.

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.081
His fingers find
the pillowcase's sailing masts.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.173
He turns on his side,
opens his eyes at once.
