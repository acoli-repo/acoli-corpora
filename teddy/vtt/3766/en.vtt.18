00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:01.158
and doors that opened and closed,

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.443
were the bathroom and the darkroom.

00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:05.893
The darkroom she built herself,

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:10.512
with custom-made stainless steel sinks,
an 8x10 bed enlarger

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.948
that moved up and down
by a giant hand crank,

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:14.655
a bank of color-balanced lights,

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.644
a white glass wall for viewing prints,

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:19.010
a drying rack that moved
in and out from the wall.

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:21.120
My mother built herself a darkroom.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.407
Made it her home.

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.091
Fell in love with a man
with basketball hands,

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.995
with the way he looked at light.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.458
They got married. Had a baby.

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:31.672
Moved to a house near a park.
