00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.283
dotting their way through
New York City's trees,

00:11:31.307 --> 00:11:36.006
tiny dots of light, blinking out at him
from out of the darkest darks.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.928
A year later he traveled
across the country to follow a forest fire

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:42.464
stayed for a week hunting
it with his camera,

00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:44.340
it was ravaging the West Coast

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:46.594
eating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.

00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:48.197
On the other side of the country,

00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:51.579
I went to class and wrote a poem
in the margins of my notebook.

00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:53.563
We have both learned the art of capture.

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:56.912
Maybe we are learning
the art of embracing.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:12:00.039
Maybe we are learning
the art of letting go.
