If I get to heaven, before you do,

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:37.770
I'll make a hole and pull you through.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:43.552
And I'll write your name on every star,

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:46.704
and that way the world

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.638
won't seem so far.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.770
The astronaut will not be at work today.

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:56.767
He has called in sick.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.919
He has turned off his cell phone,
his laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.
