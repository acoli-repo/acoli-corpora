00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.273
I realized that some people
were never gonna get to experience

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.981
what it felt like to be a teenage girl
in New York city.

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:35.910
Which meant that they weren't gonna know

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:39.156
what the subway ride
after your first kiss feels like,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.998
or how quiet it gets when its snows.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:44.634
And I wanted them to know,
I wanted to tell them.

00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:47.085
And this became the focus of my obsession.

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:50.734
I busied myself telling stories
and sharing stories and collecting them.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:52.742
And it's not until recently

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:57.075
that I realized that
I can't always rush poetry.

00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:01.004
In April for National Poetry Month,
there's this challenge
