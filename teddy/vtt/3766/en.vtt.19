00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:31.672
Moved to a house near a park.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.609
But they kept the loft on Wooster Street

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:36.182
for birthday parties and treasure hunts.

00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:38.610
The baby tipped the grayscale,

00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:42.269
filled her parents' photo albums
with red balloons and yellow icing.

00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:45.062
The baby grew into a girl
without freckles,

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:46.578
with a crooked smile,

00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:51.062
who didn’t understand why her friends
did not have darkrooms in their houses,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:52.998
who never saw her parents kiss,

00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:54.554
who never saw them hold hands.

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:56.744
But one day, another baby showed up.

00:09:56.768 --> 00:09:59.951
This one with perfect straight
hair and bubble gum cheeks.

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.601
They named him sweet potato.
