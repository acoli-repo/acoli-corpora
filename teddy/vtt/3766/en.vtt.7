00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.215
that it probably meant I had
to move pretty quickly,

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.485
because there was a lot
of stuff I needed to do.

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.779
So my life was constantly
in a state of rushing.

00:03:36.803 --> 00:03:38.970
I was always scared
that I was falling behind.

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:42.374
And since I grew up
in New York City, as far as I could tell,

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.224
rushing was pretty normal.

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:48.763
But, as I grew up, I had
this sinking realization,

00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:53.398
that I wasn't gonna get to live
any more than one life.

00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:56.428
I only knew what it felt like
to be a teenage girl

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:57.603
in New York City,

00:03:57.627 --> 00:03:59.918
not a teenage boy in New Zealand,

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:03.019
not a prom queen in Kansas.
