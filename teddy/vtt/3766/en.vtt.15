00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:30.707
Grandpa Stewart was a Navy photographer.

00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:33.675
Young, red-faced
with his sleeves rolled up,

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.327
fists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.171
he looked like Popeye
the sailor man come to life.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.612
Crooked smile, tuft of chest hair,

00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:45.017
he showed up to World War II,
with a smirk and a hobby.

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:47.707
When they asked him if he knew
much about photography,

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.019
he lied, learned to read
Europe like a map,

00:07:51.043 --> 00:07:54.233
upside down, from the height
of a fighter plane,

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:56.758
camera snapping, eyelids flapping

00:07:56.782 --> 00:07:58.997
the darkest darks and brightest brights.

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:02.007
He learned war like he could
read his way home.
