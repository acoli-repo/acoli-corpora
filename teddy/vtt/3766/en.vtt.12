00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.344
and when I can walk away from it.

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:03.685
And this goes directly against
my very obsessive nature

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:07.328
to try to find the right answer
and the perfect words and the right form.

00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:09.433
And I use poetry in my life,

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:12.169
as a way to help me navigate
and work through things.

00:06:12.193 --> 00:06:15.399
But just because I end the poem,
doesn't mean that I've solved

00:06:15.423 --> 00:06:17.407
what it was I was puzzling through.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:19.835
I like to revisit old poetry

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.674
because it shows me exactly
where I was at that moment

00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:25.611
and what it was I was trying to navigate

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.769
and the words that I chose to help me.

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:29.821
Now, I have a story

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:32.694
that I've been stumbling
over for years and years
