00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.255
what I wanted to be when I grew up,
my typical response was:

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.047
princess-ballerina-astronaut.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.603
And what she doesn't understand
is that I wasn't trying to invent

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:10.610
some combined super profession.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:14.011
I was listing things I thought
I was gonna get to be:

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:17.096
a princess and a ballerina
and an astronaut.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.859
and I'm pretty sure the list
probably went on from there.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.881
I usually just got cut off.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.771
It was never a question
of if I was gonna get to do something

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:26.855
so much of a question of when.

00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:29.755
And I was sure that if I was going
to do everything,

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.215
that it probably meant I had
to move pretty quickly,
