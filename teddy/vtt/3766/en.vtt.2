00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.919
He has turned off his cell phone,
his laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:05.092
There is a fat yellow cat
asleep on his couch,

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:06.860
raindrops against the window

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.599
and not even the hint
of coffee in the kitchen air.

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:11.872
Everybody is in a tizzy.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.842
The engineers on the 15th floor have
stopped working on their particle machine.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.644
The anti-gravity room is leaking,

00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:19.548
and even the freckled kid with glasses,

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:22.246
whose only job is to take
out the trash, is nervous,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.979
fumbles the bag, spills
a banana peel and a paper cup.

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.425
Nobody notices.

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:29.874
They are too busy recalculating
what this all mean for lost time.

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.930
How many galaxies
are we losing per second?
