00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:32.251
it had just taken me 30 tries to figure
out the way that it wanted to be told.

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:36.196
And I realized that this is probably true
of other stories on an even larger scale.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.648
I have stories that I have
tried to tell for years,

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:43.060
rewriting and rewriting and constantly
searching for the right words.

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:46.369
There's a French poet and essayist
by the name of Paul Valéry

00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:49.869
who said a poem is never
finished, it is only abandoned.

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:51.329
And this terrifies me

00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:54.732
because it implies that I could keep
re-editing and rewriting forever

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:58.209
and its up to me to decide
when a poem is finished

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.344
and when I can walk away from it.
