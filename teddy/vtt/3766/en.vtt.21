00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:31.360
But the loft of Wooster Street
was built for an artist,

00:10:31.384 --> 00:10:34.138
not a family of pigeons,

00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:37.534
and walls that do not reach the ceiling
do not hold in the yelling

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:41.800
and the man with basketball hands
put his weapons out to rest.

00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:45.063
He could not fight this war,
and no maps pointed home.

00:10:45.442 --> 00:10:47.641
His hands no longer fit his camera,

00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:49.252
no longer fit his wife's,

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:50.712
no longer fit his body.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:53.983
The sweet potato boy mashed
his fists into his mouth

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.580
until he had nothing more to say.

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:58.902
So, the girl without freckles
went treasure hunting on her own.

00:10:59.497 --> 00:11:02.908
And on Wooster Street, in a building
with the creaky hallways
