at Columbia about prison reform.

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.549
And Vanessa ...

00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:12.637

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.941

called Vocational Foundation

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.981
that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.620
but then she suffered

00:04:27.644 --> 00:04:31.708
which was particularly problematic
because she was only born with one kidney.
