00:04:56.782 --> 00:05:00.971
What these stories primarily indicate
is that teaching is social

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:03.360
and benefits from social scaffolding.

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:06.194
There were factors
pushing these two in one direction,

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.067
but through tailored
mentorship and opportunities,

00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:11.615
they were able to reflect
on their circumstances

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.151
and resist negative influences.

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.685
They also learned simple skills
like developing a network,

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:19.350
or asking for help --

00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:24.178
things many of us in this room can forget
that we have needed from time to time,

00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:25.699
or can take for granted.

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.083
And when we think of people like this,

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:32.282
we should only think of them
as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
