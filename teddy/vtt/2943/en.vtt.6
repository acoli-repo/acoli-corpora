But eventually, she was able
to go to community college,

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:02.322
get her associate's,

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:05.598
then go to an elite college
to finish her bachelor's.

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.785
So some people might
hear these stories and say,

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.818
"Yes, those two definitely have grit.

00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.706
They basically pulled themselves up
by the bootstraps."

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.488
But that's an incomplete picture,

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.033
because what's more important

00:03:18.057 --> 00:03:22.158
is that they had factors in their lives
that helped to influence their agency,

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:23.858
or their specific capacity

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:27.446
to actually overcome
the obstacles that they were facing

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.842
and navigate the system
given their circumstances.
