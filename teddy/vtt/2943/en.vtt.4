00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:00.232
but from a slightly different perspective.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:03.429
I research students who have overcome
immense obstacles

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:05.077
related to their background.

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.733
Students from low-income,

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:08.794
often single-parent households,

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:13.655
students who have been homeless,
incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.108
or some who have struggled
with substance abuse

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:18.624
or lived through violent or sexual trauma.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.328
So let me tell you about two
of the grittiest people I've met.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:25.751
Tyrique was raised by a single mother,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.629
and then after high school,
he fell in with the wrong crowd.

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:30.545
He got arrested for armed robbery.
