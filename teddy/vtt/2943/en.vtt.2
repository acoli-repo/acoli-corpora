00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.635
That's because school is in the morning,

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.531
and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:04.705
(Laughter)

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:06.413
Curry is for dinner.

00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:07.888
(Laughter)

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:09.793
So when Mahari was leaving,

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:12.809
I asked him how he was coping
with feeling isolated.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.058
And he said that despite feeling lonely,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.158
he just threw himself at his work,

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.635
that he built strategies around his grit

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.566
and his desire to be successful.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.850
A mentor of mine is actually
Dr. Angela Duckworth,

00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:29.741
the psychologist at UPenn who has defined
this stick-to-itiveness of grit

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.445
as being "the perseverance
and passion for long-term goals."
