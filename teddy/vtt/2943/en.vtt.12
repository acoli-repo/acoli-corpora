00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:03.966
and then they can tap into those internal
reservoirs of grit and character.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.629
So this here --

00:06:06.653 --> 00:06:08.368
My student Mahari

00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:11.617
got accepted to law school
with scholarships,

00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:13.157
and not to brag,

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.704
but I did write one of his letters
of recommendation.

00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.316
(Laughter)

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.298
And even though I know hard work
is what got him this achievement,

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.429
I've seen him find
his voice along the way,

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:27.294
which as someone who's grown up
a little bit shy and awkward,

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:29.631
I know it takes time and support.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:32.790
So even though
he will rely a lot on his grit
