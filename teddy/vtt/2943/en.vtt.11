we should only think of them
as exceptional, but not as exceptions.

00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:35.477
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.925
of the collective responsibility
to help students in similar situations.

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.878
When Presidents Bush, Obama
and now even Trump,

00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.600
have called education
"the civil rights issue of our time,"

00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:49.354
perhaps we should treat it that way.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:53.831
If schools were able to think
about the agency that their students have

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:56.348
and bring to the table
when they push them,

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:59.371
what students learn can become
more relevant to their lives,

00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:03.966
and then they can tap into those internal
reservoirs of grit and character.
