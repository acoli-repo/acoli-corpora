00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:05.737
So, I teach college students
about inequality and race in education,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.826
and I like to leave my office open
to any of my students

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.381
who might just want to see me to chat.

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.952
And a few semesters ago,

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:15.881
one of my more cheerful
students, Mahari,

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:17.302
actually came to see me

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:21.977
and mentioned that he was feeling
a bit like an outcast because he's black.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.874
He had just transferred to NYU
from a community college

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:26.660
on a merit scholarship,

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:28.518
and turns out,

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.824
only about five percent
of students at NYU are black.
