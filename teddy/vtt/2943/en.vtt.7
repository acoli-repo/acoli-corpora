00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.842
and navigate the system
given their circumstances.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:32.652
So, allow me to elaborate.

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:36.298
In prison, Tyrique
was actually aimless at first,

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:38.381
as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:42.219
This is until an older detainee
took him aside

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:44.784
and asked him to help
with the youth program.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.251
And in mentoring youth,

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:49.861
he started to see his own mistakes
and possibilities in the teens.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:53.939
This is what got him interested
in taking college-credit courses.

00:03:53.963 --> 00:03:55.143
And when he got out,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.381
he got a job with Fortune Society,

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.105
where many executives are people
who have been formerly incarcerated.
