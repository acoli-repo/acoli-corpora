00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.824
only about five percent
of students at NYU are black.

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.277
And so I started to remember

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.830
that I know that feeling
of being an outsider

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:37.534
in your own community.

It's partially what drew me to my work.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.032
At my university,

but in an overwhelmingly

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:54.443
I was 12,

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.419
and kids would say that were surprised
that I didn't smell like curry.

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.666

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.635
That's because school is in the morning,
