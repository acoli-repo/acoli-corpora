00:01:53.923 --> 00:02:00.116
The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads.

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.996
Hercules fought fiercely,

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:06.630
but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.312
The battle was hopeless

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:12.993
until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire,

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:15.975
keeping the heads from regrowing.

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:20.389
The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:26.357
Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive.

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:31.966
The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow.
