Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.876
gazed in horror as he realized

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:22.677
he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable.

00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:28.179
The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husbandâ€™s adultery,

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.210
had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness.
