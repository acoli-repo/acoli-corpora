00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:01.536
but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air,

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:04.408
at which point he shot them down.

00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:08.644
No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage,

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:12.871
but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick.

00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.171
And the mad King Diomedes,

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.576
who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests,

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.560
got a taste of his own medicine

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.063
when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:31.117
The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths.
