00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.645
The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar,

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.140
which had ravaged many fields.


00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.966
Advised by the wise centaur Chiron,

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.722
Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow.

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:18.653
For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:23.424
The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.792
had not been maintained in ages.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:29.300
Hercules promised to clean them in one day

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.500
if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock.
