00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:32.559
and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself.

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.179
That should have been the end.

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.582
But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted:

00:05:37.582 --> 00:05:41.187
the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it,

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.965
and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment.

00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:48.756
And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task,

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:53.800
obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.634
Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea

00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:03.244
and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location.
