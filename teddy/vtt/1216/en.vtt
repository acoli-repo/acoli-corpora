And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,

And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
