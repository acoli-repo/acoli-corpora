00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Noise becomes music.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to think that it's all about me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
All those great people here, virtuosos,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
they make noise, they need me to do that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Not really. If it were that,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I would just save you the talk,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and teach you the gesture.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So you could go out to the world

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's look at the first video.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
