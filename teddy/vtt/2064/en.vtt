00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I go on the podium.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You know, this little office of the conductor.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with a lot of space.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in front of all that noise,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you do a very small gesture.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
