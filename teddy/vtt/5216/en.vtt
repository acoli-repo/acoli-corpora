If you were trying to buy something
with a piece of paper,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:11.121
you would probably be in trouble.

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.163
Unless, of course,

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.788
that this piece of paper
is a hundred dollar bill.

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:18.829
But what makes this post
much more interesting and valuable

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.663
than other pieces of paper?

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:23.121
After all, you can’t do much with it.

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:24.704
You can’t eat it.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.371
You can’t build anything with it.

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:28.663
And burning it is illegal.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:30.204
So why is it important?
