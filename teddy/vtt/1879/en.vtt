00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
won't interest many other people.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would love to talk about my astronomy,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in non-gray atmospheres

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I'm not going to talk about that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It would be just as much fun
