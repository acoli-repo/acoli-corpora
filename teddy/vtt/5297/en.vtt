(Voice-over) John Lewis:
My friends, let us not forget

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.568
that we are involved in a serious
social revolution.

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:12.304
We want our freedom, and we want it now.

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:15.927
(Voice-over) JL: When you see something
that is not right or fair or just,

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.419
you have to say something,
you have to do something.

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:21.543
(Voice-over) JL: It doesn't matter
whether you're Black or white,

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.100
we're one people and one family.

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:24.193
(Cheers)

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:27.636
(Voice-over) JL: One person
with a dream, with a vision,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.430
can change things.
