00:08:57.238 --> 00:09:00.033
has so much better results, they will share.

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:03.750
They will share the information on how to improve.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.870
So it is, by measuring and creating transparency,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.780
you get a cycle of continuous improvement,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.654
which is what this slide shows.

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:16.595
Now, you may say this is a nice idea,

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:18.499
but this isn't only an idea.

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:20.527
This is happening in reality.

00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:23.681
We're creating a global community,

00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:25.544
and a large global community,

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:28.091
where we'll be able to measure and compare

00:09:28.091 --> 00:09:29.805
what we achieve.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:32.432
Together with two academic institutions,
