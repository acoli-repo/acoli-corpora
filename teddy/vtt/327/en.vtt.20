00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:01.572
what should we measure,

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:04.060
and to make those standards global.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.415
They've worked -- four working groups have worked

00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.383
during the past year:

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:11.227
cataracts, back pain,

00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:15.453
coronary artery disease, which is,
for instance, heart attack,

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:17.634
and prostate cancer.

00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:20.038
The four groups will publish their data

00:10:20.038 --> 00:10:21.880
in November of this year.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.338
That's the first time we'll be comparing

00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:27.284
apples to apples, not only within a country,

00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:30.465
but between countries.
