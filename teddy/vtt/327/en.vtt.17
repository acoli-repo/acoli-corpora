00:08:29.277 --> 00:08:32.775
We were always best in class.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:35.389
And if somebody can show them that the result

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.976
they perform for their patients

00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:39.830
is no better than what others do,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.537
they will do whatever it takes to improve.

00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:44.870
But most of them don't know.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.285
But physicians have another characteristic.

00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:51.127
They actually thrive from peer recognition.

00:08:51.127 --> 00:08:53.361
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist

00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:55.209
in a competing hospital

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:57.238
and discusses why that other hospital

00:08:57.238 --> 00:09:00.033
has so much better results, they will share.
