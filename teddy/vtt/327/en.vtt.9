00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:32.131
they used to operate hip surgery.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:33.859
To the left of this slide, you see a variety

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:36.896
of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:39.755
for somebody who needs a new hip.

00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:43.004
They all realized they had
their individual way of operating.

00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:45.401
They all argued that, "My technique is the best,"

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.274
but none of them actually knew,
and they admitted that.

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:52.223
So they said, "We probably need to measure quality

00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:56.392
so we know and can learn from what's best."

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:59.591
So they in fact spent two years debating,

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.886
"So what is quality in hip surgery?"
