00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.089
Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.481
and I returned to the medical university

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.343
where I studied.

00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:12.098
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:14.907
for the first time in 17 years,

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.384
in fact since I became a management consultant.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.308
There were two things that surprised me

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.425
during the month I spent.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.315
The first one was that the common theme

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.823
of the discussions we had were hospital budgets

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.746
and cost-cutting,

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.570
and the second thing, which really bothered me,
