00:10:59.363 --> 00:11:02.969
I want to manage my big institution much more

00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:07.074
on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.

00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:10.572
This particular day, we sat in a workshop

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:13.382
together with physicians, nurses and other staff,

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:17.880
discussing leukemia in children.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.657
The group discussed,

00:11:19.657 --> 00:11:21.697
how do we measure quality today?

00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:24.262
Can we measure it better than we do?

00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:26.484
We discussed, how do we treat these kids,

00:11:26.484 --> 00:11:28.535
what are important improvements?

00:11:28.535 --> 00:11:31.316
And we discussed what are
the costs for these patients,
