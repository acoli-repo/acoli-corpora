what this hospital does the right way."

00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.012
By measuring value in healthcare,

00:12:05.012 --> 00:12:07.037
that is not only costs

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:09.510
but outcomes that matter to patients,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.308
we will make staff in hospitals

00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:13.167
and elsewhere in the healthcare system

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:17.261
not a problem but an important part of the solution.

00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:19.197
I believe measuring value in healthcare

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.968
will bring about a revolution,

00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:24.077
and I'm convinced that the founder

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.540
of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.490
who always put the patient at the center,
