00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:30.137
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital,

00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:34.211
he will have the risk of becoming incontinent

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.185
by about 50 percent,

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.158
so he would have to start wearing diapers again.

00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:43.095
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.997
If he instead would go to Hamburg,

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:48.508
and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,

00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:51.191
the risk would be only one in 20.

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.776
Either you a flip a coin,

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:54.809
or you have a one in 20 risk.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.314
That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.

00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:00.299
When we look at many hospitals
