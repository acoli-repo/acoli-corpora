00:06:59.403 --> 00:07:00.982
Now, you can imagine how much savings

00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:03.482
there would be for society.

00:07:03.482 --> 00:07:06.653
We did a study where we looked at OECD data.

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:09.503
OECD does, every so often,

00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:11.659
look at quality of care

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:16.184
where they can find the data
across the member countries.

00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:18.786
The United States has, for many diseases,

00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:20.990
actually a quality which is below the average

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.408
in OECD.

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.562
Now, if the American healthcare system

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:26.998
would focus a lot more on measuring quality,

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:31.047
and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,
