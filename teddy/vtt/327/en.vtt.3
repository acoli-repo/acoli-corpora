00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:30.523
After all, the costly decisions in health care

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.991
are taken by doctors and nurses.

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.531
You choose an expensive lab test,

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:39.158
you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:43.632
So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,

00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:46.863
this is a way to hold costs down.

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:49.135
And ultimately, some physicians will say today

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.802
that they don't have the full liberty

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:55.322
to make the choices they think
are right for their patients.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.692
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues

00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:00.058
are frustrated.
