00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.886
"So what is quality in hip surgery?"

00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:04.260
"Oh, we should measure this."
"No, we should measure that."

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.311
And they finally agreed.

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.962
And once they had agreed, they started measuring,

00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:11.365
and started sharing the data.

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.964
Very quickly, they found that if you put cement

00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:15.470
in the bone of the patient

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.648
before you put the metal shaft in,

00:05:17.648 --> 00:05:19.784
it actually lasted a lot longer,

00:05:19.784 --> 00:05:21.542
and most patients would never have to be

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.903
re-operated on in their lifetime.

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.571
They published the data,

00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.694
and it actually transformed
clinical practice in the country.

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:31.985
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
