00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:31.614
So if you look at the hip surgery story again,

00:06:31.614 --> 00:06:33.985
there was a study done a couple years ago

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:37.983
where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.

00:06:37.983 --> 00:06:39.908
They looked at how many patients have needed

00:06:39.908 --> 00:06:43.989
to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:46.876
In the United States, the number was three times

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.064
higher than in Sweden.

00:06:49.064 --> 00:06:52.504
So many unnecessary surgeries,

00:06:52.504 --> 00:06:55.244
and so much unnecessary suffering

00:06:55.244 --> 00:06:56.936
for all the patients who were operated on

00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:59.403
in that seven year period.

00:06:59.403 --> 00:07:00.982
Now, you can imagine how much savings
