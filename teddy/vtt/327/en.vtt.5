00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:30.286
by value:

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.772
outcomes that matter to patients

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:35.781
relative to the money we spend.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.526
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:42.531
by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.674
On this picture, you have my father-in-law

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:49.060
surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.096
When we started doing our research at BCG,

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:54.756
we decided not to look so much at the costs,

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:57.296
but to look at the quality instead,

00:02:57.296 --> 00:02:59.877
and in the research, one of the things

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:02.919
that fascinated us was the variation we saw.
