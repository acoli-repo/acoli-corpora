WEBVTT

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:31.047
and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.385
it would save the American people

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:37.511
500 billion U.S. dollars a year.

00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:40.738
That's 20 percent of the budget,

00:07:40.738 --> 00:07:43.451
of the healthcare budget of the country.

00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:45.558
Now you may say that these numbers

00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:48.449
are fantastic, and it's all logical,

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.459
but is it possible?

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:53.098
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:56.678
and I would argue that not only can it be done,

00:07:56.678 --> 00:07:58.912
but it has to be done.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.303
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses
