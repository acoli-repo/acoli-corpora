00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:31.985
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:34.022
Since then, they publish every year.

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:35.970
Once a year, they publish the league table:

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.457
who's best, who's at the bottom?

00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:41.137
And they visit each other to try to learn,

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:44.927
so a continuous cycle of improvement.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:47.734
For many years, Swedish hip surgeons

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:50.121
had the best results in the world,

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:52.599
at least for those who actually were measuring,

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.035
and many were not.

00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:57.917
Now I found this principle really exciting.

00:05:57.917 --> 00:05:59.720
So the physicians get together,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.845
they agree on what quality is,
