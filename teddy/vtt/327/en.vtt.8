00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:00.299
When we look at many hospitals

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.973
for many different diseases,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:04.990
we see these huge differences.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.884
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.

00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:09.731
And often, the data actually doesn't exist.

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:11.450
Nobody knows.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.803
So going the hospital is a lottery.

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:20.083
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.575
In the late '70s, there were a group

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:25.007
of Swedish orthopedic surgeons

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.866
who met at their annual meeting,

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.827
and they were discussing the different procedures

00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:32.131
they used to operate hip surgery.
