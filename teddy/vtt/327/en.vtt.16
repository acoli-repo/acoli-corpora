00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.303
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.995
in the healthcare system.

00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:07.109
In my practice as a consultant,

00:08:07.109 --> 00:08:09.376
I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred

00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:12.253
doctors and nurses and other hospital

00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:15.210
or healthcare staff every year.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.396
The one thing they have in common is

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.674
they really care about what they achieve

00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:22.908
in terms of quality for their patients.

00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:24.991
Physicians are, like most of you in the audience,

00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:27.527
very competitive.

00:08:27.527 --> 00:08:29.277
They were always best in class.

00:08:29.277 --> 00:08:32.775
We were always best in class.
