And then you have
the colorless subway line

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.173
intersecting with each
of the other colors,

00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:38.820
which basically he does

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.802
He catches up with each of these people

00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:44.332

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:59.401

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.196
and will want to read it
