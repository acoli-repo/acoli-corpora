00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:32.497
which will be coming out this fall,

00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:34.378
and that is the entire cover.

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:39.324
There is no other typographic information
or visual information on the front,

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:42.737
and the name of the book
is "Only What's Necessary."

00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:48.790
So this is sort of symbolic about
the decisions I have to make every day

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.706
about the design that I'm perceiving,

00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:54.985
and the design I'm creating.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:56.842
So clarity.

00:01:57.332 --> 00:01:59.421
Clarity gets to the point.

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.758
It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.
