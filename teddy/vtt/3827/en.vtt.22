00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.625
just grafted onto Los Angeles.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:04.899
My editor in chief said,
"You know, it's interesting

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:10.286
but I think you can do better
and I think you can make it simpler."

00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:14.506
And so I went back
to the drawing board, as I often do.

00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:19.197
But also, being alive to my surroundings,

00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:22.830
I work in a high-rise in Midtown,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.500
and every night,
before I leave the office,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.745
I have to push this button to get out,

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:32.483
and the big heavy glass doors open
and I can get onto the elevator.
