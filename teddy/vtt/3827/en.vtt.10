and will want to read it

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:07.345

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:09.858
["The Visual Vernacular."]

00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:14.177
This is a way to use a more
familiar kind of mystery.

00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:15.938
What does this mean?

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:18.772
This is what it means.
["Make it look like something else."]

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:23.302
The visual vernacular is the way
we are used to seeing a certain thing

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:27.691
applied to something else so that
we see it in a different way.

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.840
This is an approach I wanted to take
to a book of essays by David Sedaris
