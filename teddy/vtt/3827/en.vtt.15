whitewater rafting to see
if he would survive.

00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:34.679
And then he would write about it,
and he felt that he was a fraud

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:36.978
and that he was misrepresenting himself.

00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:41.645
And so I wanted the cover of this book
to also misrepresent itself

00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:46.916
and then somehow show
a reader reacting to it.

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:50.167
This led me to graffiti.

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:52.210
I'm fascinated by graffiti.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.903
I think anybody who lives
in an urban environment

00:07:54.903 --> 00:07:58.943
encounters graffiti all the time,
and there's all different sorts of it.

00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:02.550
