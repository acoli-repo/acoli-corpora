00:11:59.232 --> 00:12:01.763
and graphically it's more interesting

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:05.989
and creates a bigger tension
between the idea

00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:11.096
of a certain kind of sunrise
coming up over L.A. and America.

00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:14.492
["'Gulp' A tour of the human
digestive system by Mary Roach."]

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:16.530
Mary Roach is an amazing writer

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.152
who takes potentially mundane
scientific subjects

00:12:20.152 --> 00:12:23.540
and makes them not mundane at all;
she makes them really fun.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.167
So in this particular case,

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.279
it's about the human digestive system.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:33.201
So I'm trying to figure out what
is the cover of this book going to be.
