There is another kind of graffiti
that I find far more interesting,

00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:34.538
which I call editorial graffiti.

00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:38.744
This is a picture I took recently
in the subway,

00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:42.610
and sometimes you see
lots of prurient, stupid stuff,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.517
but I thought this was interesting,
and this is a poster that is saying

00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:49.747
rah-rah Airbnb,

00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:52.510
and someone has taken a Magic Marker

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.434
and has editorialized about
what they think about it.

00:08:56.434 --> 00:08:59.266
And it got my attention.

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:02.692
So I was thinking, how do we
apply this to this book?
