00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.718
and then the Japanese-American
internment camps are quickly created,

00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:34.738
and there's lots of tension

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:38.824
and horrible stuff as he's still
trying to solve this murder.

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:44.656
And so I did at first think
very literally about this in terms of

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:48.538
all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor
and we'll add it to Los Angeles

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:55.736
and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn
on the horizon of the city.

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:58.561
And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor

00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:01.625
just grafted onto Los Angeles.
