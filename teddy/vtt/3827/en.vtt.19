And they went for it! (Laughter)

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.107
Author liked it, publisher liked it,

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:34.824
and that is how the book
went out into the world,

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:39.723
and it was really fun to see
people reading this on the subway

00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:41.859
and walking around with it
and what have you,

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:45.760
and they all sort of looked
like they were crazy.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.120

["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"]
Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.117
a good friend, I've worked
with him for many years.

00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:57.325
He is probably best known as the author

00:09:57.325 --> 00:10:00.295
of "The Black Dahlia"
and "L.A. Confidential."
