So I'm trying to figure out what

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:37.845
This is a self-portrait. (Laughter)

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:43.905
Every morning I look at myself
in the medicine cabinet mirror

00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:46.622
to see if my tongue is black.

00:12:46.622 --> 00:12:50.170
And if it's not, I'm good to go.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.279
(Laughter)

00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:58.296
I recommend you all do this.

00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:02.243
