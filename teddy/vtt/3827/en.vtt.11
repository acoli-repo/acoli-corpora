This is an approach I wanted to take
to a book of essays by David Sedaris

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.211
that had this title at the time.
["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:39.402
Now, the challenge here was that
this title actually means nothing.

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:42.792
It's not connected to any
of the essays in the book.

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:47.503
It came to the author's boyfriend
in a dream.

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:53.659
Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) --
so usually, I am creating a design

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.722
that is in some way based on the text,
but this is all the text there is.

00:05:57.722 --> 00:06:02.111
So you've got this mysterious title
that really doesn't mean anything,
