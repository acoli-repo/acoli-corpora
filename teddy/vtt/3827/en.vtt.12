00:05:57.722 --> 00:06:02.111
So you've got this mysterious title
that really doesn't mean anything,

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.610
so I was trying to think:

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.848
Where might I see a bit of mysterious text
that seems to mean something but doesn't?

00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:13.255
And sure enough, not long after,

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:16.570
one evening after a Chinese meal,

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:23.062
this arrived, and I thought,
"Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)

00:06:23.472 --> 00:06:28.673
I've always loved the hilariously
mysterious tropes of fortune cookies

00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:31.575
that seem to mean something extremely deep
