Okay. Now how many people
know what this is?

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:12.410
Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes
by the genius Charles M. Schulz,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.454
we now have seven deft strokes
that in and of themselves

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:18.984
create an entire emotional life,

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:21.863
one that has enthralled
hundreds of millions of fans

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.906
for over 50 years.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:26.420
This is actually a cover of a book

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.711
that I designed about the work
of Schulz and his art,

00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:32.497
which will be coming out this fall,
