It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.370
We ask ourselves this.
["When should you be clear?"]

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.818
Now, something like this,
whether we can read it or not,

00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:16.418
needs to be really, really clear.

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:18.455
Is it?

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:27.284
This is a rather recent example
of urban clarity that I just love,

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:32.392
mainly because I'm always late
and I am always in a hurry.
