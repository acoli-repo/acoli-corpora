00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.160
Tsukuru Tazaki, his name
does not correspond to a color,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.610
so his nickname is Colorless, and
as he's looking back on their friendship,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.776
he recalls that they were like
five fingers on a hand.

00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:12.257
So I created this sort of abstract
representation of this,

00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:16.437
but there's a lot more going on
underneath the surface of the story,

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:21.110
and there's more going on underneath
the surface of the jacket.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.515
The four fingers are now four train lines

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.582
in the Tokyo subway system,

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:29.973
which has significance within the story.
