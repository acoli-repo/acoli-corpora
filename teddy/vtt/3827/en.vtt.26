But I also started thinking,
here's our introduction.

00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:05.122
Right? Into the human digestive system.

00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:08.210
But I think what we can all agree on

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.460
is that actual photographs
of human mouths, at least based on this,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.244
are off-putting. (Laughter)

00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:20.145
So for the cover, then,
I had this illustration done

00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:22.374
which is literally more palatable

00:13:22.374 --> 00:13:26.902
and reminds us that it's best
to approach the digestive system

00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:29.200
from this end.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.847
(Laughter)
