00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we use 20 million barrels

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and the Chinese use 10.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The Chinese have a little bit better plan --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
or they have a plan;

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we have no plan.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In the history of America,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we've never had an energy plan.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We don't even realize the resources

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that we have available to us.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
If you take the last 10 years

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and bring forward,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
If you go forward the next 10 years
