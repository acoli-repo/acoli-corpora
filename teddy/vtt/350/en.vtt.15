00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But here you can look at the list.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Natural gas will fit all of those.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It will replace or be able to be used for that.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's for power generation, transportation,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
it's peaking fuel, it's all those.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Do we have enough natural gas?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Look at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's what we use a year.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Go forward

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and the estimates that you have

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
from the EIA and onto the industry estimates --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the industry knows what they're talking about --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
we've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet
