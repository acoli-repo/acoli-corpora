00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I mean seriously, the Department of Energy

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
did not have anything to do with fracking.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The first frack job was in '47.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I saw my first one in '53.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Never had a problem

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
with messing up an aquifer or anything else.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Now the largest aquifer in North America

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
across eight states --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
big aquifer:

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Ogallala, Triassic age.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked
