(Applause)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Chris Anderson: Thanks for that.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So from your point of view,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you had this great Pickens Plan

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that was based on wind energy,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and you abandoned it basically

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
because the economics changed.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
What happened?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
TBP: I lost 150 million dollars.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
(Laughter)

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
That'll make you abandon something.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
No, what happened to us, Chris,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is that power, it's priced off the margin.
