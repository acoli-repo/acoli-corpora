00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So actually most of the 11 we have

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are tied up in the Mid-East.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They're there to control,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
keep the shipping lanes open

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and make oil available.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
which is about 25 percent of all the oil used

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
everyday in the world.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we're doing it with four percent of the population.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Somehow that doesn't seem right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's not sustainable.
