00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Somehow that doesn't seem right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's not sustainable.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So where do we go from here?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Does that continue?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Yes, it's going to continue.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The slide you're looking at here

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is 1990 to 2040.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Over that period

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you are going to double your demand.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And when you look at what we're using the oil for,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
70 percent of it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is used for transportation fuel.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So when somebody says,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
"Let's go more nuclear,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
let's go wind, let's go solar,"
