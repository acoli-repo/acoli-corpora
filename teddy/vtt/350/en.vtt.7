One is under construction by the Chinese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and the other 11 belong to us.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Do we have a corner on the market?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Are we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If you look at where they're located --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and on this slide it's the red blobs on there --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
there are five that are operating in the Mid-East,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and the rest of them are in the United States.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So actually most of the 11 we have
