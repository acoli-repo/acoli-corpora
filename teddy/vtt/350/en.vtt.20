that you're going to use some methane --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I'm gone, so it's up to you --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
but we do have

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
plenty of methane hydrates.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So I think I've made my point

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
