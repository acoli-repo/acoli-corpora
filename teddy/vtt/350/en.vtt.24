00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and the price plummeted,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which made wind uncompetitive.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In a nutshell that's what happened?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
TBP: That's what happened.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We found out that we could go to the source rock,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which were the carboniferous shales in the basins.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
across New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and Haynesville in Louisiana.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
This stuff is everywhere.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We are overwhelmed with natural gas.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?
