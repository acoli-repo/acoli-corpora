00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at another decision point.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What is the decision point?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's what we're going to use

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the future.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So from here,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's pretty clear to me,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we would prefer to have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
cleaner, cheaper,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
domestic, ours --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and we have that, we have that --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which is natural gas.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So here you are,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that the cost of all this to the world

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is 89 million barrels of oil,
