00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But as I said, I'm for anything American.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now let me take you -- I've been a realist --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I went from theorist early to realist.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I'm back to theorist again.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
If you look at the world,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
you have methane hydrates in the ocean

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
around every continent.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And here you can see methane,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
if that's the way you're going to go,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that there's plenty of methane --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
natural gas is methane,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
methane and natural gas are interchangeable --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
but if you decide

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that you're going to use some methane --
