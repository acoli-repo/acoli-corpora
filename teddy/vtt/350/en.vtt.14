00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
we want it to do.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's 130 octane fuel.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And it does not require a refinery.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's going to be very simple for us to use.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It's going to be simple to accomplish this.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
what you're looking for to make it happen.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But here you can look at the list.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Natural gas will fit all of those.
