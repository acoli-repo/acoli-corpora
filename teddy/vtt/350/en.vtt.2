00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At that point,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we were looking for a fuel

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that was cleaner,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it was cheaper,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it wasn't ours though,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it was theirs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So at that point, 1912,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we selected crude oil over whale oil

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and some more coal.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But as we moved on

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to the period now, 100 years later,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we're back really

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at another decision point.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What is the decision point?
