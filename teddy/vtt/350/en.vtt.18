There are 250 million vehicles in America.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So what you have

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is natural gas is the bridge fuel,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
is the way I see it.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I don't have to worry

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
about the bridge to where at my age.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
(Laughter)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That's your concern.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But when you look at the natural gas we have

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
it could very well be

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the bridge to natural gas,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because you have plenty of natural gas.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But as I said, I'm for anything American.
