00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the long-term,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I don't mind going back to nuclear.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I can tell you what the last page

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
of the report that will take them five years to write

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
will be.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
One, don't build a reformer on a fault.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And number two,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
do not build a reformer on the ocean.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And now I think reformers are safe.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Move them inland

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and on very stable ground

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and build the reformers.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
There isn't anything wrong with nuke.
