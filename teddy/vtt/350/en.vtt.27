00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is lower than oil and coal, correct?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And so everyone can be at least happy

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But if that's it

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and that becomes the reason

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that renewables don't get invested in,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
then, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but Jim and I talked

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
there as he left,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."
