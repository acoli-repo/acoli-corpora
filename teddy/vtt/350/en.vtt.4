WEBVTT

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is 89 million barrels of oil,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
give or take a few barrels, every day.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the cost annually

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is three trillion dollars.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And one trillion of that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
goes to OPEC.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That has got to be stopped.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
it cost seven trillion dollars --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
on the Milken Institute study last year --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
seven trillion dollars

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
since 1976,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is what we paid for oil from OPEC.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now that includes the cost of military
