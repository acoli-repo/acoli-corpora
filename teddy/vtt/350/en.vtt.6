WEBVTT

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And with that,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we have found ourselves

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to be the world's policemen.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We are policing the world,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and how are we doing that?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I know the response to this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Raise your hand if you think you know.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There are 12.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
One is under construction by the Chinese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and the other 11 belong to us.
