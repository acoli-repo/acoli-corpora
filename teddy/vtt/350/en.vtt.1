00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It wasn't. It was 1928.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But go back to 1912,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
100 years ago,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and look at that point

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what we, our country, was faced with.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's the same energy question

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that you're looking at today,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but it's different sources of fuel.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and we were looking at whale oil

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we were looking at crude oil.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At that point,
