00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the industry knows what they're talking about --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
we've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
of natural gas that's available to us.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
How does that translate

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to barrels of oil equivalent?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It would be three times

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
what the Saudis claim they have.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
which I do not believe.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I think it's probably 175 billion barrels.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we have plenty of natural gas.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So I have tried to target

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
on where we use the natural gas.
