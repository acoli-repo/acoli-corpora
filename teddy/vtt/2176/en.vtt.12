00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.226
if there's a storm coming
from one direction or another

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.768
or if the seasons are changing,

00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:07.268
you can use these
adaptable reef structures

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:10.559
to use the force of the waves
to accumulate sand.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.184
And we think this could be used
in many coastal regions

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:15.934
and many island nations around the world.

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.559
But when we think about building
smarter environments,

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:22.268
think of smarter buildings
or smarter cars or smarter clothing,

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:24.768
that typically means adding more power,

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:28.809
more batteries, more devices,
more cost, more complexity

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:31.059
and ultimately more failure.
