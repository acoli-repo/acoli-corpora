00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.059
just after two days.

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:34.476
So this was last February,
and it's very much ongoing work.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.059
This is just in the beginning
of this research.

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:38.809
Over the next year and longer,

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.601
we're going to be studying this
through satellite imagery

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:42.934
and bathymetry data

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.476
to understand what the short-term
and long-term impacts are

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.476
of natural sand accumulation
in the environment.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.018
And the bigger vision, though,

00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:53.351
is that we want to build
submersible geometries,

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.476
almost like submarines
that we can sink and float.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.601
Like adaptable artificial reefs,

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.893
you could deploy them

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.226
if there's a storm coming
from one direction or another
