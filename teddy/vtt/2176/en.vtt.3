00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.434
and they were interested in taking
some of this research and ways of thinking

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.309
and applying it to some
of the challenges that they've faced

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.684
in terms of climate change.

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:38.018
And the first thing you do

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.393
when you're approached
by someone in the Maldives

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.309
is say you want to go on a site visit.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.351
(Laughter)

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:44.643
It is amazing.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:45.934
So we went there

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.893
and I actually walked away
with a really different perspective

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:50.518
on the future of climate change.

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:53.518
Because you would imagine,
you know, the Maldives are sinking.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:55.601
They're screwed.
What are they going to do?

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.143
But I walked away thinking,
they might be the model,

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:01.934
the future model of the built environment,
where they can adapt and be resilient
