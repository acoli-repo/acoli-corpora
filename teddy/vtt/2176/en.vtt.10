00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.143
they're just human scale.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.851
Large objects filled with sand,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.393
we'd place them underwater,
they're just really simple geometries.

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:08.351
In the front of them,
you'll see it's clear water.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.559
The waves are crashing over.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:11.893
It's quite clear.

00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:14.059
And then on the backside,
there's turbulence.

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.309
The water and the sand is mixing up.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.809
It's causing sediment transport,
and then the sand is accumulating.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.768
You'll see some friendly stingrays
here that visited us.

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:25.559
On the left is day one,
the right is day three.

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:27.809
You'll see the sand ripples
in the light areas

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.309
where the sand is accumulating

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.059
just after two days.
