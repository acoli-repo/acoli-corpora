00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:02.059
and we placed geometries underwater.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.601
We tried all sorts
of different geometries.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.101
The waves interact with the geometry,

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.559
and then create turbulence
and start to accumulate the sand

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:14.018
so the sand starts to form
these sandbars on their own.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:15.351
Here's an aerial view.

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:18.184
On the left-hand side,
you'll see the beach that's growing.

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.559
In the middle you'll see
the sandbar that formed.

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:24.268
So these are geometries that collaborate
with the force of the wave to build.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:27.434
We then started to fabricate one.
This was in February in Boston.

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:29.809
We have large rolls of canvas.

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:31.434
It's a biodegradable material,
