00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:02.393
they can assemble in the airspace,
and as the helium dies,

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.101
they then come back to the ground,

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.934
and you're left with a big
space frame structure.

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.601
All of this research is about
taking simple materials,

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:13.393
activating them with forces
in their environment --

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:16.393
gravity, wind, waves,
temperature, sunlight --

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:17.893
and getting them to perform,

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:20.643
getting them to transform, assemble, etc.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.309
How do we build smart things

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.726
without complex electromechanical devices?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.768
But more recently we were approached
by a group in the Maldives,

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.434
and they were interested in taking
some of this research and ways of thinking
