00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.268
We can build walls.

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:33.268
The problem here is that
we take a static solution

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:37.976
trying to fight against a superdynamic,
high-energy problem,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.643
and nature is almost always going to win.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.726
So that's likely not going to work either.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.809
The third approach is using dredging.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:48.101
So dredging is where you suck up
a bunch of sand from the deep ocean

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.976
and you pump it back onto the beaches.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.893
If you go to any beach
around the Northeast or Western Coast,

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:55.768
you'll see that they use dredging
year after year after year

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.059
just to survive.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.893
It's really not a good solution.

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:02.809
In the Maldives, they do the same thing,
and they can build an island in a month,
