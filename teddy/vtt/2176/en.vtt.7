00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:33.476
This is massive amounts of sand
that naturally accumulates

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.601
just based on the forces of the waves

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.476
and the ocean topography.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.893
So we started to study that.
Why do sandbars form?

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:41.226
If we could tap into that,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.601
we could understand it
and we could utilize it.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.976
It's based on the amount
of energy in the ocean

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.893
and the topography in the landscape
that promotes sand accumulation.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:53.184
So what we're proposing
is to work with the forces of nature

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:55.351
to build rather than destroy,

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.726
and in my lab at MIT,
we set up a wave tank,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.893
a big tank that's pumping waves,

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:02.059
and we placed geometries underwater.
