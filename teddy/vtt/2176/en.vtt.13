00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:31.059
and ultimately more failure.

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:34.934
So we're always trying to think about
how do we build smarter things with less?

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.684
How do we build smarter things
that are simple?

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:41.351
And so what we're proposing at the lab
and with this project specifically

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:44.101
is to use simple materials like sand

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.476
that collaborates with forces
in the environment like waves

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.768
to accumulate and adapt.

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:53.101
And we'd like to work with you,
collaborate with us, to develop this,

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.559
to scale it and apply
this way of thinking.

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:58.351
We think it's a different
model for climate change,

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.018
one that's about adaptation and resilience
