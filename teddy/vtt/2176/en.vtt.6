In the Maldives, they do the same thing,
and they can build an island in a month,

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.434
a brand new island
they build from dredging.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.268
But it's really, really bad
for the marine ecosystem,

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.351
and then they become addicted to dredging.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.184
They need to do that year after year.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.018
But in the time that it took them
to build that one island,

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:17.393
three sandbars built themselves,

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:19.726
and these are massive amounts of sand

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.768
so big you can park your boat on it,

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:23.976
and this is what's called a site visit.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.309
It's really hard work.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.351
(Laughter)

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.958
In Boston winters.

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:33.476
This is massive amounts of sand
that naturally accumulates
