It's a biodegradable material,

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.976
it's super cheap, easy to work with.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.851
We then sew it into these large bladders,

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.351
and then we flew over there.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:41.393
And I know what you're thinking.
This is not the Fyre Festival.

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:42.893
(Laughter)

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.226
This is real life. It's real.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.143
And we flew there with these
canvas bladders in our suitcases,

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:52.059
we got sunburned
because it was Boston winter,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.101
and then we filled them with sand
and we placed them underwater.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.309
These are exactly the same geometries
that you saw in the tank,

00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.143
they're just human scale.
