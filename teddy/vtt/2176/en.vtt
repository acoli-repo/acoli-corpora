00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:02.768
For nearly a decade,

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:05.018
my collaborators and I
at the Self-Assembly Lab

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:08.559
have been working on material systems
that transform themselves,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:09.893
assemble themselves

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:11.542
and adapt to their environment.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.768
From our early work on 4D printing,

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:17.143
where we printed objects,
dipped them underwater,

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:18.976
and they transform,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.434
to our active auxetics that respond
to temperature and sunlight,

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.601
to our more recent work on active textiles

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:29.226
that respond to body temperature
and change porosity,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.893
to our rapid liquid printing work
