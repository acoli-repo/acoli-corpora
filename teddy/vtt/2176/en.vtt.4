00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:01.934
the future model of the built environment,
where they can adapt and be resilient

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.226
rather than our fixed,
man-made infrastructure.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.309
But there's typically
three main approaches

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.184
to sea level rise and climate change.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:11.018
One of them is that we can do nothing
and we can run away.

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:12.851
And that's a pretty bad idea.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.226
As more than 40 percent
of the world's population

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.226
is living in coastal areas,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.976
as sea levels rise
and as storms get worse and worse,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.143
we're going to be
more and more underwater.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:26.309
So it's imperative that we solve
this pretty demanding problem.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.893
The second is that we can build barriers.

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.268
We can build walls.
