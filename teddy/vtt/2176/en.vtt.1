00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.893
to our rapid liquid printing work

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:32.768
where we print inflatable structures

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:34.893
that morph based on air pressure

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.351
and go from one shape to another,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:38.726
or our self-assembly work

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.643
where we dip objects underwater,

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.559
they respond to wave energy
and assemble themselves

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.875
into precise objects like furniture.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.226
Or, at larger scales,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.601
using wind energy,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.559
we have meter-diameter weather balloons

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.559
that assemble in the airspace
above a construction site.

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:57.476
For dangerous environments
or harsh, extreme places

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.559
where it's hard to get
people or equipment,

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:02.393
they can assemble in the airspace,
and as the helium dies,
