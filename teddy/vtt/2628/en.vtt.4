sometimes over 10 feet wide.

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:05.904
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry
like charcoal, but colors.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:09.754
I consider my work drawings
but others call them painting.

00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:14.224
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to
as a "finger painter."

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:15.366
(Laughter)

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.695
But I don't use any tools

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.196
and I have always used
my fingers and palms

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.646
to manipulate the pigment on the paper.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.576
Drawing is a form of meditation for me.

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:29.981
It quiets my mind.
