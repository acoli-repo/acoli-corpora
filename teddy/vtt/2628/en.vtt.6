(Applause)

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:07.792
Really, more like 200 hours,
250 hours for something that size.

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:10.798
But I've been drawing ever since
I could hold a crayon, really.

00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:12.735
My mom was an artist, and growing up,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.245
we always had art supplies
all over the house.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.822
My mother's love of photography

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:21.381
propelled her to the most
remote regions of the earth,

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.811
and my family and I were fortunate enough

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.536
to join and support her
on these adventures.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.847
We rode camels in Northern Africa

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:32.918
and mushed on dog sleds
near the North Pole.
