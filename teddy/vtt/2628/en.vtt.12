00:05:57.484 --> 00:06:01.027
Devastating events happen every day

00:06:01.051 --> 00:06:04.299
on scales both global and personal.

00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:06.107
When I was in Greenland,

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:10.045
I scattered my mother's ashes
amidst the melting ice.

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:15.830
Now she remains a part
of the landscape she loved so much,

00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:19.941
even as it, too, passes
and takes on new form.

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.863
Among the many gifts my mother gave me

00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:26.887
was the ability to focus on the positive,

00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:28.434
rather than the negative.

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:35.164
My drawings celebrate the beauty
of what we all stand to lose.
