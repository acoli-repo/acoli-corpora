00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:30.826
is humbling.

00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:34.591
The ice fields are alive
with movement and sound

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:36.752
in a way that I never expected.

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:39.532
I expanded the scale of my compositions

00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:44.317
to give you that same sense of awe
that I experienced.

00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:48.716
Yet, while the grandeur
of the ice is evident,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.676
so, too, is its vulnerability.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:52.257
From our boat,

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:57.645
I could see the ice sweating
under the unseasonably warm sun.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.503
We had a chance to visit
many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
