00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.503
We had a chance to visit
many of the Inuit communities in Greenland

00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:05.357
that now face huge challenges.

00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:08.697
The locals spoke to me
of vast areas of sea ice

00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:11.407
that are no longer
freezing over as they once did.

00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:14.509
And without ice, their hunting
and harvesting grounds

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.295
are severely diminished,

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.160
threatening their way
of life and survival.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:22.511
The melting glaciers in Greenland

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:26.879
are one of the largest
contributing factors to rising sea levels,

00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:29.019
which have already begun to drown

00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:31.873
some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
