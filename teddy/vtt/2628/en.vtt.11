some of our world's lowest-lying islands.

00:05:32.942 --> 00:05:36.458
One year after my trip to Greenland,
I visited the Maldives,

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:40.352
the lowest and flattest country
in the entire world.

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:44.785
While I was there, I collected
images and inspiration

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.510
for a new body of work:

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:51.105
drawings of waves lapping
on the coast of a nation

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.283
that could be entirely underwater
within this century.

00:05:57.484 --> 00:06:01.027
Devastating events happen every day
