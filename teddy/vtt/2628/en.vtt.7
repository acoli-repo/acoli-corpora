and mushed on dog sleds
near the North Pole.

00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:38.067
In August of 2012,
I led my first expedition,

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:42.605
taking a group of artists and scholars
up the northwest coast of Greenland.

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:47.122
My mother was originally
supposed to lead this trip.

00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.861
She and I were in the early
stages of planning,

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:52.447
as we had intended to go together,

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.146
when she fell victim to a brain tumor.

00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:59.809
The cancer quickly took over
her body and mind,

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:02.380
and she passed away six months later.
