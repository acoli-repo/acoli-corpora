00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:35.040
I have dedicated my career
to illuminating these projections

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.128
with an accessible medium,

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:41.606
one that moves us in a way
that statistics may not.

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:45.363
My process begins
with traveling to the places

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.686
at the forefront of climate change.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.672
On-site, I take thousands of photographs.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:51.939
Back in the studio,

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:56.223
I work from both my memory
of the experience and the photographs

00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:58.502
to create very large-scale compositions,

00:01:58.526 --> 00:02:00.666
sometimes over 10 feet wide.
