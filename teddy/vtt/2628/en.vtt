00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:03.853
I consider it my life's mission

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.515
to convey the urgency
of climate change through my work.

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.702
I've traveled north to the Arctic
to the capture the unfolding story

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:13.205
of polar melt,

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.141
and south to the Equator to document
the subsequent rising seas.

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:21.593
Most recently, I visited
the icy coast of Greenland

00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:24.483
and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:28.984
connecting two seemingly disparate
but equally endangered

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.475
parts of our planet.
