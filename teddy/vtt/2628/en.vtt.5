00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:32.244
I don't perceive what I'm drawing

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:33.641
as ice or water.

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:36.127
Instead, the image is stripped down

00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:39.840
to its most basic form of color and shape.

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:42.306
Once the piece is complete,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.466
I can finally experience
the composition as a whole,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.052
as an iceberg floating
through glassy water,

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:50.766
or a wave cresting with foam.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:55.806
On average, a piece this size
takes me about,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.520
as you can see, 10 seconds.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.324
(Laughter)

00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:02.871
(Applause)
