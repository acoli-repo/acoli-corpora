00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.095
During the months of her illness, though,

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:10.619
her dedication to the expedition
never wavered, and I made a promise

00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:12.508
to carry out her final journey.

00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:16.517
My mother's passion for the Arctic

00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.914
echoed through my experience in Greenland,

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:22.914
and I felt the power

00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:25.488
and the fragility of the landscape.

00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:29.398
The sheer size of the icebergs

00:04:29.422 --> 00:04:30.826
is humbling.
