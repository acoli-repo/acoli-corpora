00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.475
parts of our planet.

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:37.547
My drawings explore moments
of transition, turbulence

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.285
and tranquility in the landscape,

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.791
allowing viewers to emotionally connect

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:46.530
with a place you might never
have the chance to visit.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:51.579
I choose to convey the beauty
as opposed to the devastation.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.662
If you can experience the sublimity
of these landscapes,

00:00:56.686 --> 00:01:00.299
perhaps you'll be inspired
to protect and preserve them.
