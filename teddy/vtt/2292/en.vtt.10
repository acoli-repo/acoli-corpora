00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.757
and hearing aids were no longer helping.

00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:06.019
So in 2003, I made the tough decision
to have the cochlear implant.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.324
I just needed to stop
that soul-sucking cycle of loss,

00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:14.986
regardless of whether
the operation worked,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.452
and I really didn't think that it would.

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:21.156
I saw it as one last box to check off

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.435
before I made the transition
to being completely deaf,

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.593
which a part of me wanted.

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.331
Complete silence is very addictive.
