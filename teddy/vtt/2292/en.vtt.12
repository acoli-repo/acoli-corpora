My mind is no longer competing
with the distraction of sound.

00:06:02.243 --> 00:06:05.413
It's freed up to think more creatively.

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.459
There are advantages
to having bionic body parts as well.

00:06:11.483 --> 00:06:14.412
It's undeniably convenient
to be able to hear,

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:16.610
and I can turn it off any time I want.

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.802
(Laughter)

00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:22.564
I'm hearing when I need to be,
and the rest of the time, I'm not.

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:24.540
Bionic hearing doesn't age,

00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:28.161
although external parts
sometimes need replacement.

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.560
It would be so cool
