00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:02.971
I just wanted to be part
of a community like me.

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:04.779
I wanted everyone else to be deaf.

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:10.864
I think that sense of belonging
is what ultimately connects our stories,

00:04:10.888 --> 00:04:12.501
and mine felt incomplete.

00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:16.248
When cochlear implants first got going,

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:17.884
back in the '80s,

00:04:17.908 --> 00:04:22.233
the operation was
Frankenstein-monster scary.

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:27.754
By 2001, the procedure
had evolved considerably,

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:31.167
but it still wiped out
any natural hearing that you had.
