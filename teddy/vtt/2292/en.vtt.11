00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.331
Complete silence is very addictive.

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:37.961
Maybe you've spent time
in a sensory deprivation tank,

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:39.677
and you know what I mean.

00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.979
Silence has mind-expanding capabilities.

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.915
In silence, I see sound.

00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:49.296
When I watch a music video without sound,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.868
I can hear music.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.956
In the absence of sound,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.726
my brain fills in the gaps
based on the movement I see.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.219
My mind is no longer competing
with the distraction of sound.
