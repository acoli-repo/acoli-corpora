00:10:56.954 --> 00:11:01.200
Before the implant, I had stopped
using the voice telephone

00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:02.931
and switched to email,

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.933
but people kept leaving me voice mail.

00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:08.518
They were upset
that I was unreachable by phone

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:10.757
and not returning messages.

00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:14.224
I continued to tell them my situation.

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:16.089
It took them months to adapt.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.209
Fast-forward 10 years,

00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:22.041
and you know who else hated voice mail?

00:11:22.612 --> 00:11:23.763
Millennials.

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:26.310
(Laughter)

00:11:26.334 --> 00:11:27.660
And you know what they did?

00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:32.915
They normalized texting
for communication instead.
