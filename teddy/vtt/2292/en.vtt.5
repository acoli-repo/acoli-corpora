00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.783
With a cochlear implant,

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:35.759
computer chips do the job
for the damaged hair cells.

00:02:36.324 --> 00:02:39.661
Imagine a box of 16 crayons,

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:43.168
and those 16 crayons, in combination,

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:46.214
have to make all of the colors
in the universe.

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.614
Same with the cochlear implant.

00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:52.535
I have 16 electrodes
in each of my cochleas.

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:58.279
Those 16 electrodes, in combination,
send signals to my brain,

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.669
representing all of the sounds
in the universe.
