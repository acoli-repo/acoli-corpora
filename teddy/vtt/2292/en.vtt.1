The good news is
I come for your technology

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:32.703
and not for your human life-forms.

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:34.884
(Laughter)

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.544
Actually, I've never seen
an episode of Star Trek.

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:39.609
(Laughter)

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.595
But there's a reason for that:

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:44.471
television wasn't closed-captioned
when I was a kid.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.078
I grew up profoundly deaf.

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:50.213
I went to regular schools,
and I had to lip-read.

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:52.983
I didn't meet another
deaf person until I was 20.

00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.181
Electronics were mostly audio back then.

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:59.701
My alarm clock was my sister Barbara,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.757
who would set her alarm
and then throw something at me to wake up.
