in the universe.

00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:06.641
I have electronics inside
and outside of my head

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.156
to make that happen,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.251
including a small processor,
magnets inside my skull

00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:15.883
and a rechargeable power source.

00:03:15.907 --> 00:03:19.597
Radio waves transmit sound
through the magnets.

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.200
The number one question that I get
about the cochlear implant

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:26.464
when people hear about the magnets

00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:28.901
is whether my head sticks
to the refrigerator.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:35.216
(Laughter)
