00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:35.216
(Laughter)

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.669
No, it does not.

00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:38.470
(Laughter)

00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:40.193
(Applause)

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:42.382
Thank you, thank you.

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:44.192
(Applause)

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:45.828
I know this, because I tried.

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:47.637
(Laughter)

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:50.455
Hearing people assume that the Deaf

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.597
live in a perpetual state
of wanting to hear,

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:56.978
because they can't imagine any other way.

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.453
But I've never once wished to be hearing.

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:02.971
I just wanted to be part
of a community like me.
