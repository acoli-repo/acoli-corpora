00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:31.167
but it still wiped out
any natural hearing that you had.

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:35.857
The success rate then
for speech comprehension was low,

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.611
maybe 50 percent.

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:40.882
So if it didn't work,
you couldn't go back.

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:46.628
At that time, implants were also
controversial in the Deaf culture.

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:50.048
Basically, it was considered
the equivalent

00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:52.165
of changing the color of your skin.

00:04:52.954 --> 00:04:54.814
I held off for a while,

00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:58.074
but my hearing was going downhill fast,

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.757
and hearing aids were no longer helping.
