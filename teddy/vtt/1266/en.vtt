00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi there.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to be talking a little bit about

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
music, machines and life.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Or, more specifically,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
for a music video.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some of you may recognize this image.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We'll be showing the video at the end,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what it is that they wanted.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --
