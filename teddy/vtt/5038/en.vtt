00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.780
Consider the spot where you’re sitting.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.640
Travel backwards in time

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.500
and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.290
buried under miles of rock,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.720
or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.568
But go back far enough—

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.498
about 4.6 billion years,

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:30.908
and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas
