00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:10.829
In 1967, researchers from around the world

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.829
gathered to answer 
a long-running scientific questionâ€”

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.621
just how long is a second?

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:19.871
It might seem obvious at first.

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:21.746
A second is the tick of a clock,

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:25.746
the swing of a pendulum, 
the time it takes to count to one.

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.413
But how precise are those measurements?

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:30.454
What is that length based on?
