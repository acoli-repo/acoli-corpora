00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:31.188
Each pulse travels to this visible wall

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:33.339
and some light scatters
back to our camera,

00:02:33.363 --> 00:02:36.579
but we also use the wall
to scatter light around the corner

00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:38.536
to the hidden object and back.

00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.601
We repeat this measurement many times

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.165
to capture the arrival times
of many photons

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.276
from different locations on the wall.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.156
And after we capture
these measurements, we can create

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.815
a trillion-frame-per-second
video of the wall.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.379
While this wall may look
ordinary to our own eyes,

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:59.878
at a trillion frames per second,
we can see something truly incredible.
