00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.675
from each of the mirrored
facets of the disco ball,

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.890
scattering against the wall over time.

00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:07.958
The bright streaks of light that you see
arriving soonest in time

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:11.942
are from the glossy dragon statue
that's closest to the wall,

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:15.767
and the other streaks of light come from
reflections of light from the bookcase

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.124
and from the statue.

00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:21.614
Now, we can also visualize
these measurements frame by frame,

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:22.830
as a video,

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:24.736
to directly see the scattered light.

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:29.080
And again, here we see, first,
reflections of light from the dragon,

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:30.350
closest to the wall,
