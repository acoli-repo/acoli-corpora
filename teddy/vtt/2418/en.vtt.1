Fortunately, our future car
will have this superpower,

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:37.145
a camera that can see around corners
to detect these potential hazards.

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.955
For the past few years as a PhD student

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.256
in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.034
I've been working on a camera
that can do just this --

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:48.456
a camera that can image objects
hidden around corners

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.252
or blocked from direct line of sight.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:54.728
So let me give you an example
of what our camera can see.

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:57.315
This is an outdoor experiment we conducted

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.149
where our camera system is scanning
the side of this building with a laser,
