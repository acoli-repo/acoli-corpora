00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:30.350
closest to the wall,

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.763
followed by bright dots
from the disco ball

00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:36.506
and other reflections from the bookcase.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.982
And finally, we see the reflected
waves of light from the statue.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.633
These waves of light illuminating the wall

00:04:44.657 --> 00:04:49.275
are like fireworks that last
for just trillionths of a second.

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:56.895
And even though these objects
reflect light differently,

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.553
we can still reconstruct their shapes.

00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:02.337
And this is what you can see
from around the corner.
