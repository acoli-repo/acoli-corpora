00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.199
but what I showed you today
would have been impossible

00:06:02.223 --> 00:06:03.387
just two years ago.

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.268
For example, we can now image large,
room-sized hidden scenes outdoors

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:09.141
and at real-time rates,

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:13.522
and we've made significant advancements
towards making this a practical technology

00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:15.839
that you could actually see
on a car someday.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:18.736
But of course, there's still
challenges remaining.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.823
For example, can we image
hidden scenes at long distances

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:25.990
where we're collecting
very, very few photons,

00:06:26.014 --> 00:06:29.291
with lasers that are low-power
and that are eye-safe.

00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:31.976
Or can we create images from photons
