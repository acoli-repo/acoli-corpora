00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:04.642
We can actually see waves of light
scattered back from the hidden scene

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.733
and splashing against the wall.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.015
And each of these waves
carries information

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.317
about the hidden object that sent it.

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:14.022
So we can take these measurements

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:16.545
and pass them into
a reconstruction algorithm

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.450
to then recover the 3D geometry
of this hidden scene.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.189
Now I want to show you one more example
of an indoor scene that we captured,

00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:28.323
this time with a variety
of different hidden objects.

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.474
And these objects
have different appearances,
