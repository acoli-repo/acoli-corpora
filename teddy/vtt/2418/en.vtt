00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:02.112
In the future,

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:05.790
self-driving cars will be safer
and more reliable than humans.

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:07.397
But for this to happen,

00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:10.151
we need technologies
that allow cars to respond

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:11.442
faster than humans,

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.180
we need algorithms
that can drive better than humans

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:19.307
and we need cameras
that can see more than humans can see.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:24.791
For example, imagine a self-driving car
is about to make a blind turn,

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.149
and there's an oncoming car

00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:28.958
or perhaps there's a child
about to run into the street.

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:33.022
Fortunately, our future car
will have this superpower,
