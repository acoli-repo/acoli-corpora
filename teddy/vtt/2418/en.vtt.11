00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:30.125
By capturing photons that scatter
from the wall to my tracksuit,

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:32.283
back to the wall and back to the camera,

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:35.903
we can capture this indirect
video in real time.

00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:40.160
And we think that this type
of practical non-line-of-sight imaging

00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:43.910
could be useful for applications
including for self-driving cars,

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.029
but also for biomedical imaging,

00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:49.624
where we need to see
into the tiny structures of the body.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.475
And perhaps we could also put
similar camera systems on the robots

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.164
that we send to explore other planets.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.601
Now you may have heard
about seeing around corners before,

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.199
but what I showed you today
would have been impossible
