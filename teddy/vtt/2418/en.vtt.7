00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.474
And these objects
have different appearances,

00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:32.331
so they reflect light differently.

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:36.109
For example, this glossy dragon statue
reflects light differently

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.910
than the mirror disco ball

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.545
or the white discus thrower statue.

00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:44.417
And we can actually see the differences
in the reflected light

00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:47.282
by visualizing it as this 3D volume,

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:50.616
where we've just taken the video frames
and stacked them together.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.939
And time here is represented
as the depth dimension of this cube.

00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:59.105
These bright dots that you see
are reflections of light

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.675
from each of the mirrored
facets of the disco ball,
