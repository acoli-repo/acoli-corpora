00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.149
where our camera system is scanning
the side of this building with a laser,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.133
and the scene that we want to capture

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:06.117
is hidden around the corner
behind this curtain.

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.118
So our camera system
can't actually see it directly.

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:10.729
And yet, somehow,

00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:15.301
our camera can still capture
the 3D geometry of this scene.

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:17.104
So how do we do this?

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.220
The magic happens here
in this camera system.

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:23.569
You can think of this
as a type of high-speed camera.

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:27.063
Not one that operates
at 1,000 frames per second,

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.832
or even a million frames per second,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.109
but a trillion frames per second.
