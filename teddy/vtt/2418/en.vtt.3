00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.109
but a trillion frames per second.

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:37.858
So fast that it can actually capture
the movement of light itself.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:42.295
And to give you an example
of just how fast light travels,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.604
let's compare it to the speed
of a fast-running comic book superhero

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:49.376
who can move at up to three times
the speed of sound.

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:54.400
It takes a pulse of light
about 3.3 billionths of a second,

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.297
or 3.3 nanoseconds,

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.450
to travel the distance of a meter.

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.409
Well, in that same time,
