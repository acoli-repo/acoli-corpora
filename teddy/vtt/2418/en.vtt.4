00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.409
Well, in that same time,

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:04.307
our superhero has moved
less than the width of a human hair.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:05.900
That's pretty fast.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:08.760
But actually, we need to image much faster

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:12.172
if we want to capture light
moving at subcentimeter scales.

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.281
So our camera system can capture photons

00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:18.821
at time frames of just
50 trillionths of a second,

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.590
or 50 picoseconds.

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:24.323
So we take this ultra-high-speed camera

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:28.021
and we pair it with a laser
that sends out short pulses of light.

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:31.188
Each pulse travels to this visible wall
