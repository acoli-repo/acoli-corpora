This is the legacy

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.645
of Manifest Destiny.

00:12:35.453 --> 00:12:39.680
Prisoners are still born
into prisoner of war camps,

00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:41.666
long after the guards are gone.

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:49.092
These are the bones
left after the best meat has been taken.

00:12:51.891 --> 00:12:53.209

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:55.210
a series of events was set in motion

00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:58.736
by a people who look like me, by wasichu,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.219
eager to take the land and the water
and the gold in the hills.
