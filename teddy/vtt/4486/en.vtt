I'm here today to show
my photographs of the Lakota.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.555
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.519
or at least the larger group of tribes,

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:09.999
called the Sioux.

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.803
The Lakota are one of many tribes
that were moved off their land

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:15.232
to prisoner-of-war camps,

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:16.778
now called reservations.

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:19.584
The Pine Ridge Reservation,

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:21.740
the subject of today's slide show,

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:26.066
is located about 75 miles southeast
of the Black Hills in South Dakota.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.017
It is sometimes referred to
as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,
