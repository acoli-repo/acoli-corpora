It is sometimes referred to
as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.167
and it is where the Lakota now live.

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.377
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.321
the American Indian Movement,

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.187
or of Russell Means,

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.623
or Leonard Peltier,

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.710
or of the standoff at Oglala,

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:47.871
then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero
for Native issues in the US.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.415
So I've been asked to talk
a little bit today

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.607
about my relationship with the Lakota,

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:55.607
and that's a very difficult one for me,

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.089
because, if you haven't
noticed from my skin color,

00:00:58.113 --> 00:00:59.502
I'm white,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.526
and that is a huge barrier
on a Native reservation.
