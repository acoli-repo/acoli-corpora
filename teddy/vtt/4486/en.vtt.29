00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:30.691
So where does that leave us?

00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:33.240
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.690
The United States continues
on a daily basis to violate the terms

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:44.163
of the 1851 and 1868
Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.

00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:47.055
The call to action I offer today --

00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:49.941
my TED wish -- is this:

00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:52.632
Honor the treaties.

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.922
Give back the Black Hills.

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:57.561
It's not your business
what they do with them.

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:06.777
