00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.788
The suffering of indigenous peoples
is not a simple issue to fix.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.656
It's not something everyone can get behind

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.529
the way they get behind helping Haiti,

00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:12.956
or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.705
The "fix," as it's called,

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.376
may be much more difficult
for the dominant society

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.697
than, say, a $50 check

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:24.018
or a church trip to paint
some graffiti-covered houses,

00:14:24.042 --> 00:14:25.653
or a suburban family

00:14:25.677 --> 00:14:28.653
donating a box of clothes
they don't even want anymore.

00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:30.691
So where does that leave us?
