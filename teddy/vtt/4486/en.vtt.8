00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.719
We promise that the Powder River country

00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:02.882
will henceforth be closed to all whites.

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.559
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.043
for Red Cloud and the Sioux.

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.979
In fact, this is the only war
in American history

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:13.048
in which the government negotiated a peace

00:04:13.072 --> 00:04:15.743
by conceding everything
demanded by the enemy.

00:04:18.753 --> 00:04:22.495
1869: The Transcontinental
Railroad was completed.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.906
It began carrying, among other things,
large numbers of hunters,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.276
who began the wholesale
killing of buffalo,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.858
eliminating a source of food,
clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
