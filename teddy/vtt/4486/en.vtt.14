00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:01.658
On December 29,

00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:04.864
US troops surrounded a Sioux
encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,

00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:08.937
and massacred Chief Big Foot
and 300 prisoners of war,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.463
using a new rapid-fire weapon
that fired exploding shells,

00:07:12.487 --> 00:07:13.645
called a Hotchkiss gun.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.130
For this so-called "battle,"

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:19.157
20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor

00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:21.013
were given to the 7th Cavalry.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.703
To this day,

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:29.113
this is the most Medals of Honor
ever awarded for a single battle.
