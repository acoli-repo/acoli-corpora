00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:01.872
Only 10 percent of the adult
male population signed.

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:06.305
The Fort Laramie Treaty called
for at least three-quarters of the tribe

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:07.488
to sign away land.

00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:10.082
That clause was obviously ignored.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.261
1887: The Dawes Act.

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:16.376
Communal ownership
of reservation lands ends.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.491
Reservations are cut up
into 160-acre sections,

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:21.496
and distributed to individual Indians

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.376
with the surplus disposed of.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.219
Tribes lost millions of acres.

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:28.569
The American dream
of individual land ownership

00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:30.588
turned out to be a very clever way
