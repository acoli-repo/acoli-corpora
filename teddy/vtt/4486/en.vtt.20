00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.796
The court determined that when the Sioux
were resettled onto reservations

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.907
and seven million acres
of their land were opened up

00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:05.981
to prospectors and homesteaders,

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.568
the terms of the second
Fort Laramie Treaty

00:10:08.592 --> 00:10:09.799
had been violated.

00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:14.272
The court stated that the Black Hills
were illegally taken,

00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:16.911
and that the initial
offering price, plus interest,

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:18.729
should be paid to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.852
As payment for the Black Hills,

00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:25.308
the court awarded only 106 million dollars
to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:28.376
The Sioux refused the money
with the rallying cry,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.376
"The Black Hills are not for sale."
