Those events led to a domino effect
that has yet to end.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.767
As removed as we,
the dominant society, may feel

00:13:12.154 --> 00:13:14.747
from a massacre in 1890,

00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:18.497
or a series of broken
treaties 150 years ago,

00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:21.132
I still have to ask you the question:

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:24.711
How should you feel
about the statistics of today?

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:29.042
What is the connection
between these images of suffering

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:31.042
and the history that I just read to you?
