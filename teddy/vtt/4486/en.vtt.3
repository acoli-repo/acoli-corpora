00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:31.228
And that's what I want to focus on --

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.348
the one who takes
the best part of the meat.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.033
It means "greedy."

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.154
So take a look around

we have indeed taken
the best part of the meat.

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:55.376
So let's look today
at a set of photographs

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.038
of a people who lost

00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:59.039
so that we could gain,

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.569
and know that when you see
these people's faces,
