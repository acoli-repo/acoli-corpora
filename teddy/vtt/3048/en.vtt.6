Many of these records
only exist in a handful of copies,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.896
and some have never even been found,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.136
never been heard.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.240
They're literally endangered species.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.736
I'll tell you a story

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.696
that for me sort of sums up
the value of the work of record diggers.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.760
The story of a brilliant
Montreal musician and composer.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.536
Henri-Pierre Noël
was born and raised in Haiti,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.080
but he lived briefly
in the US and in Belgium.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.856
He passed through Montreal
what was supposed to be for two weeks,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.056
but he ended up
staying for the next 40 years.
