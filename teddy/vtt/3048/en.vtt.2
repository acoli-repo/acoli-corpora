00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480
Records that have become cultural waste.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.496
The earliest record collectors
from about the '30s to the 1960s

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.336
found and preserved
so many important records

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
that would have been lost forever.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.216
In those days, most
cultural and public institutions

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.456
didn't really care
to preserve these treasures.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.360
In many cases, they were just
throwing them into the garbage.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.616
Record digging is a lifestyle.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.056
We're absolutely obsessed
with obscure records,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.256
expensive records, dollar-bin records,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.576
crazy artwork,
