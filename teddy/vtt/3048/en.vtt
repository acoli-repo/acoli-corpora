00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.760
I became obsessed with records
when I was about 12 years old.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.576
My parents used to give me money to eat

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.336
and on most days, instead of eating,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.736
I would save it and buy myself
a record at the end of the week.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.816
Here I am with a gigantic Walkman
that's about half my leg --

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.696
(Laughter)

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.576
It actually looks more like a VCR.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.456
(Laughter)

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.736
So when I was a teenager,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.736
the obsession of buying cassettes,
vinyls and CDs just kept growing.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.736
I was even working
in a record store for many years

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.600
and only ever got paid in records.
