00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.496
yet people choose to listen to more
of the same music than ever before.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.760
And that's a sad thing.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.896
Inspired by my love for music research,
record digging and curation,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.056
I started a website called
"Music Is My Sanctuary" in 2007.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.816
Our slogan has always been
"Future Classics and Forgotten Treasures."

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.336
And it shows our love
for discovering music

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.936
and introducing music both old and new.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.216
From humble beginnings,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.056
we've built a worldwide platform
with a massive audience

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.256
with over 100 collaborators.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.616
We've created over
10,000 pieces of content,
