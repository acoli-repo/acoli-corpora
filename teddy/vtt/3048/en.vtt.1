00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.600
and only ever got paid in records.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.456
One day I realized
that I had thousands of records more

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.056
than I could even listen to in my life.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.056
I became what many of us are:

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.856
record junkies --

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.680
or record diggers,
as we like to call ourselves.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.536
Record digging, as the name suggests,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.696
means getting your hands dirty.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.256
It means spending hours
rummaging through warehouses,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.536
church basements,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.816
yard sales, record stores --

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.336
all to find records that have been
forgotten for decades.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480
Records that have become cultural waste.
