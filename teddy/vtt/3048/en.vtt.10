00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.000
until only a few copies
in the world remained.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.216
Then in the mid-2000s,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.096
a Montreal record digger
that goes by the name Kobal

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.240
was doing his weekly rounds
of just hunting for records.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.376
He was in a flea market

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.496
surrounded by thousands
of other dirty, dusty, moldy records.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.440
That's where he found the "Piano" album.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.456
He wasn't specifically looking for it.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.816
Actually, you could say
it sort of found him.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.816
You could also say that after 20 years
of record digging every single week,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.400
he had developed a sixth sense
for finding the gold.
