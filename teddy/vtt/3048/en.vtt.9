00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.576
if you weren't in jukeboxes
or if you weren't invited to play on TV,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.416
the odds were completely against you.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.056
Releasing an album
as an independent artist

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.176
was so much more difficult
than it is today,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.816
both in terms of being heard
and just distributing the thing.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.016
So, soon after,
he released a second album,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.096
kept a busy schedule playing piano
in various clubs in the city,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.280
but his records started
to accumulate dust slowly.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.816
And those 2,000 copies
in the span of 30 years

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.816
easily started to get lost

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.000
until only a few copies
in the world remained.
