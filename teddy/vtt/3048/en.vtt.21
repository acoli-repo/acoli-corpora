if you're trying to watch
something on Netflix,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.336
you're actually only browsing
through a catalog of 6,000 titles.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.256
Now, compare that with Spotify;

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.376
if you want to pick
something to listen to,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.136
you're browsing through a catalog
of 30 million songs.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.416
So I think as you can see,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.616
this notion of paralysis by choice

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.696
affects music more than movies,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.136
for example.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.416
And there's a few studies

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.616
that are starting to show
the effects of this.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.376
A recent look at the UK music market

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.816
shows that the top one percent of artists
in the UK are actually earning 77 percent
