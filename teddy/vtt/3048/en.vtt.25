I could talk about the passion
of record digging for days,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.576
but let me conclude this way.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.336
After many years of doing it,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.160
a record collector's collection
becomes sort of his autobiography.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.136
Last year, I was DJ-ing in Poland,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.136
and the people that were hosting me,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.256
they had this amazing record collection,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.896
and of course I was intrigued

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.496
and I said, "Are you selling these?"

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.096
They then explained to me
that it was the collection

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.000
that belonged to their dear friend Maceo
who passed away a few months earlier.
