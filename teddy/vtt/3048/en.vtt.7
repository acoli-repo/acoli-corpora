00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.056
but he ended up
staying for the next 40 years.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.136
When he was young,
he learned to play piano

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.096
and developed a very particular way
of playing his instrument:

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000
very fast and almost like a percussion.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.056
His style was a mix
of his Haitian influences and folklore

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.616
mixed with the American influences
that he grew up hearing.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.800
So he created a mix
of compas mixed with funk and jazz.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.016
As a young man,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.936
he played and toured with live bands
in the US and in Europe,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.320
but had never recorded an album
or a song before moving to Canada.
