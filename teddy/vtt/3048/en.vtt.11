He took the record and inspected it:

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.656
the front, the artwork,
the back, the liner notes,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.376
and he was intrigued by the fact
that this Haitian musician made a record

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.736
in Quebec in the late '70s,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.600
so he was intrigued.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.816
He took out his little,
plastic, portable turntable

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.696
that he brought with him
whenever he was on these digging quests

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.376
and put the record on.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.040
So why don't we do the same thing?
