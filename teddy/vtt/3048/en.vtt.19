00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.000
like "Who's that playing trumpet
on track three?"

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.936
Then we file them, we contextualize them,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.216
and we keep them safe.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.720
We are music archivists.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.136
And the last thing we do

We give records back
their rightful place in music history.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.096
We are tastemakers and curators.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.400
We are musicologists.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.936
So for myself

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.936
and most of the record collectors
I've encountered in 20 years,
