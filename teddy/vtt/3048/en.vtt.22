00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.816
shows that the top one percent of artists
in the UK are actually earning 77 percent

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.456
of the total revenues
inside the music industry.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.976
That's 2013,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.216
and that's progressively getting worse,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.016
or progressing.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.896
Anyway, if you're in the one percent,
I'm sure you're happy.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.176
(Laughter)

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.560
So the takeaway for me is

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.680
it's easier for people
to listen to music than ever before.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.696
People have more music
at their disposal than ever before,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.496
yet people choose to listen to more
of the same music than ever before.
