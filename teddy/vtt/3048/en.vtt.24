WEBVTT

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.616
We've created over
10,000 pieces of content,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.000
over 500 hours of audio content.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.376
Our audience consists of people

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.856
who just want more
than what's being offered to them

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.376
by mainstream music channels.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.600
They want to do --

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.656
they want to dig deeper,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.600
but they don't necessarily
have 20 hours a week like us nerds,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.240
so they trust us to do that for them.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.536
Curation is at the heart
of everything we do.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.120
We believe in human
recommendations over algorithms.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.336
I could talk about the passion
of record digging for days,
