00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.176
So he found the card
inside the record sleeve --

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.616
of course he did try to call,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.040
but after 30 years,
the number didn't work anymore.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.936
So it was only in Belgium,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.536
where the artist had once lived,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.696
that Kobal managed to find someone
that knew the artist personally

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.040
and gave him the contact.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.576
So when he finally
sat down with the artist,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.800
he made him a promise to someday
find a way to get the album rereleased.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.816
He then arranged for a British label
called Wah Wah 45s

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.720
to get the two albums reissued.
