crazy artwork,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.960
sub-subgenres.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.456
And all of the tiniest details
that go with each release.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.576
When the media talks
about the vinyl revival

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.656
that's been happening
these last few years,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.576
they often forget
to mention this community

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.336
that's been keeping the vinyl
and the tradition and the culture alive

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.960
for these last 30 years.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.136
It's a very close-knit
but competitive society, a little bit,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.216
because when you're hunting
for extremely rare records,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.656
if you miss your opportunity,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
you might not see that record
ever in your life.
