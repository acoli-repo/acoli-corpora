00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
you might not see that record
ever in your life.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.816
But I guess the only person in here
truly impressed by record collectors

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.360
is another record collector.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.936
To the outside world,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.016
we seem like a very weird,
oddball group of individuals.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.256
And --

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.696
(Laughter)

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.936
And they're mostly right.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.616
All the record collectors I know
are obsessive maniacs.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.680
We know we're all crazy in some way.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.256
But I think we should be viewed
a little bit more like this.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.296
(Laughter)

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.656
We're music archaeologists.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.880
We're hunting down the lost artifact.
