It was in Montreal in 1979

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.296
that he released
his first album called, "Piano."

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.320
Completely on his own,
on Henri-Pierre Noël Records.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.320
He only made what he could afford:
2,000 copies of the record.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.840
The record received
a little bit of airplay,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.495
a little bit of support
in Canada and in Haiti,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.976
but without a big label behind it,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.600
it was very, very difficult.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.616
Back then,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.336
if your record wasn't getting played
on mainstream radio,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.576
if you weren't in jukeboxes
or if you weren't invited to play on TV,
