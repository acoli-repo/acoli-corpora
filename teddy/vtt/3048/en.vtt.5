00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.880
We're hunting down the lost artifact.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.936
We all have a list of records that we
would do anything to get our hands on,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.616
that we've been chasing for years,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.960
and we actually call this list
our "holy grails."

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.816
When you're digging for records,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.976
you're surrounded by music you don't know.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.296
You're surrounded by mystery
and by all these dreams --

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.280
records that people once believed in.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.736
Imagine the thousands of artists
who were destined to be legends

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.376
but for various reasons,
were just overlooked.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.616
Many of these records
only exist in a handful of copies,
