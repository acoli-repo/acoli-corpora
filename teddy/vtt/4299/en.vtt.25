00:12:29.422 --> 00:12:32.737
we were storing a tremendous amount
of the location data.

00:12:33.173 --> 00:12:37.034
So Apple responded, saying,
this was not location data about you,

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:39.863
it was location data
about wireless networks

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:42.174
that were in the area where you are.

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:43.626
So it's not about you,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.234
but it's about where you are.

00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:46.906
(Laughter)

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.738
This is very valuable data.

00:12:49.762 --> 00:12:54.387
It's like gold to researchers,
this human-mobility data.

00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:58.075
So we thought, "Man!
How many people have iPhones?"

00:12:58.099 --> 00:12:59.547
How many of you have iPhones?
