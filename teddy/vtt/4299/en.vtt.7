00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:32.816
when everybody had a computer
but none of them knew how to program,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.651
they would think you were crazy.

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37.150
So let's skip forward a few years.

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:39.762
I'm starting my career as an artist,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:43.748
and I'm building things
with my computer, small-scale things,

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:47.375
investigating things like
the growth systems of plants.

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.398
Or, in this example, I'm building
a simulated economy

00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:54.383
in which pixels are trading color
with one another,

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.982
trying to investigate how
these types of systems work,

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.408
and just kind of having fun.

00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:01.060
And then this project led me
to start working with data.
