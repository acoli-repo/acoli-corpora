00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:01.060
And then this project led me
to start working with data.

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.073
So I'm building graphics like this,

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:06.691
which compare "communism" --

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:10.110
the frequency of usage of the word
"communism" in the New York Times --

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.071
to "terrorism," at the top.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:16.720
You see "terrorism" kind of appears
as "communism" is going away.

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:20.560
And with these graphics, I was really
interested in the aesthetic of the graphs.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:21.734
This is Iran and Iraq.

00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:25.668
It reads like a clock. It's called
a "timepiece graph."

00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:31.403
This is another timepiece graph,
overlaying "despair" over "hope."
