Wednesday -- one Wednesday,
when I was about 12 years old,

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:35.409
I didn't have a computer.

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:38.813
On Thursday, I had a computer.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.964
Can you imagine that change?

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.098
It's so drastic.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:47.573
I can't even think about anything
that could change our lives that way.

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:50.364
But I'm actually not even going
to talk about the computer.

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:53.618
I'm going to talk about a program
that came loaded on that computer.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:55.914
And it was build by,
not the guy on the left,

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:57.373
but the guy on the right.

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:59.541
Does anybody know
who the guy on the right is?
