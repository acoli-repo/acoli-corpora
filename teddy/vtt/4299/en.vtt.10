00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:03.691
And from there, I started to be
interested again in more active systems.

00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.979
Here's a project called "Just Landed,"

00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:09.154
where I'm looking at people
tweeting on Twitter.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:11.238
"Hey! I just landed
in Hawaii!" -- you know,

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:14.964
how people just casually try to sneak
that into their Twitter conversation.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:18.105
"I'm not showing off. Really.
But I did just land in Hawaii."

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.872
And then I'm plotting
those people's trips,

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:24.108
in the hopes that maybe
we can use social network

00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:25.813
and the data that it leaves behind

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.036
to provide a model of how people move,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.035
which would be valuable
to epidemiologists, among other people.
