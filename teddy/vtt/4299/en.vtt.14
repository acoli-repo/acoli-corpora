00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.592
how does that content get
from person A to person B?

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:08.082
Or maybe, person A to person B
to person C to person D?

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:10.460
We know that people share content
in the internet,

00:07:10.484 --> 00:07:12.842
but what we don't know
is what happens in that gap

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.657
between one person to the other.

00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:17.037
So we decided to build
the tool to explore that,

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.884
and this tool is called Cascade.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:22.066
If we look at these systems

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.520
that start with one event
that leads to other events,

00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:28.782
we call that structure a cascade.

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.215
And these cascades
actually happen over time.
