I want to talk to you about two
of the most exciting possible things.

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.897
You've probably guessed what they are --

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:14.382

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.853

a definition of history.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.742
But let's think instead
of history within a framework.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.377

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.293

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.745
we're taking things
that have happened in the past,
