00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.031
these are all things
that I just did for fun.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.790
It may seem weird,
but this comes back from HyperCard.

00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:06.644
I'm building tools for myself.

00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:08.651
I may share them with a few other people,

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.782
but they're for fun, they're for me.

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:17.311
So, all these tools I show you
kind of occupy this weird space

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.879
somewhere between science, art and design.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.708
That's where my practice lies.

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:24.888
And still today,
from my experience with HyperCard,

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:29.142
what I'm doing is building visual tools
to help me understand systems.
