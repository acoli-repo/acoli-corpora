00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:01.900
coworkers are placed together.

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:06.589
So this memorial actually considers
all of these myriad connections

00:11:06.613 --> 00:11:09.034
that were part of these people's lives.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.743
I worked with a company
called Local Projects

00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:16.441
to work on an algorithm
and a software tool

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:19.469
to help the architects build
the layout for the memorial:

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:22.053
almost 3,000 names

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:25.704
and almost 1,500 of these
adjacency requests,

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:27.338
these requests for connection --

00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:30.748
so a very dense story,
a very dense narrative,
