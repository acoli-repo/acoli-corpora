This is one of my favorites.
We call this the "Rabbi Cascade."

00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:37.657
It's a conversation amongst rabbis
about this article in the New York Times,

00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.453
about the fact that religious workers
don't get a lot of time off.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:45.512
I guess Saturdays and Sundays are bad days
for them to take off.

00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:49.228
So, in this cascade, there's a group
of rabbis having a conversation

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.654
about a New York Times story.

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.802
One of them has the best
Twitter name ever --

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.681
he's called "The Velveteen Rabbi."

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:57.028
(Laughter)

00:09:57.052 --> 00:10:01.559
But we would have never found this
if it weren't for this exploratory tool.
