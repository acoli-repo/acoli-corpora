This is another timepiece graph,
overlaying "despair" over "hope."

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:34.737
And there's only three times -- actually,
it's "crisis" over "hope" --

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:37.370
there's only three times
when "crisis" eclipses "hope."

00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.549
We're in the middle
of one of them right now.

00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:41.345
But don't think about that too much.

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.257
(Laughter)

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:47.061
And finally, the culmination of this work
with the New York Times data

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.287
a few years ago

00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.487
was the attempt to combine
an entire year's news cycle

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.824
into a single graphic.

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:57.075
So these graphics actually show us
a full year of news, all the people,

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.729
and how they're connected
into a single graphic.

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:03.691
And from there, I started to be
interested again in more active systems.
