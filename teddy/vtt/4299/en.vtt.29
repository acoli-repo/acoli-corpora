00:14:29.457 --> 00:14:30.931
it gains meaning.

00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:34.283
And I think this is tremendously,
tremendously important,

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:39.225
because these are our histories
that are being stored on these devices.

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.803
And by thinking about them that way,

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:45.445
putting them in a human context --

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:49.131
first of all, what we do with our own data
is get a better understanding

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.634
of the type of information
that we're sharing.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:55.711
But if we can do this with other data,
if we can put data into a human context,

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:58.653
I think we can change a lot of things,

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:05.062
because it builds, automatically, empathy
for the people involved in these systems.
