00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.102
Crazy idea today.

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:34.099
And these programs were not the apps
that we think about today,

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:36.572
with their large budgets
and their big distribution.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:37.785
These were small things,

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.691
people making applications to keep track
of their local basketball team scores

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:44.540
or to organize their research

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.580
or to teach people about classical music

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:51.699
or to calculate weird astronomical dates.

00:02:51.723 --> 00:02:54.104
And then, of course,
there were some art projects.

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:55.348
This is my favorite one.

00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:57.461
It's called "If Monks Had Macs,"

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:02.019
and it's a nonlinear
kind of exploratory environment.
