00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:30.956
So here's what it really looks like,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.720
and here's the cascade
playing in real time.

00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:35.823
I have to say, this was
a tremendous moment.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:39.864
We had been working with canned
data, fake data, for so long,

00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:42.693
that when we saw this
for the first moment,

00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:47.595
it was like an archaeologist who had
just dusted off these dinosaur bones.

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:51.497
We discovered this thing,
and we were seeing it for the first time,

00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:55.233
these sharing structures
that underlie the internet.

00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:58.580
And maybe the dinosaur
analogy is a good one,

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.651
because we're actually making
some probabilistic guesses
