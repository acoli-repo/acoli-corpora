00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.215
And these cascades
actually happen over time.

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:33.259
So we can model these things over time.

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:37.314
Now, the New York Times has
a lot of people who share our content,

00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:40.829
so the cascades do not look like that one,
they look more like this.

00:07:40.853 --> 00:07:42.393
Here's a typical cascade.

00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:45.131
At the bottom left, the very first event.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:50.509
And then as people are sharing
the content from one person to another,

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.327
we go up in the Y axis,
degrees of separation,

00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.119
and over on the X axis, for time.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.644
So we're able to look at that conversation
in a couple of different views:
