00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:06.086
So in this room, we have this tremendous
database of location data

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.885
that researchers
would really, really like.

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.940
So we built this system called Open Paths,

00:13:11.964 --> 00:13:14.620
which lets people upload their iPhone data

00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:18.440
and broker relationships
with researchers to share that data,

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.851
to donate that data to people
that can actually put it to use.

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:24.606
Open Paths was a great
success as a prototype.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.063
We received thousands of data sets,

00:13:28.087 --> 00:13:29.436
and we built this interface

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.778
which allows people to actually
see their lives unfolding
