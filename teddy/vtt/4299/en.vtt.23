00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:30.748
so a very dense story,
a very dense narrative,

00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:33.588
that becomes an embodied part
of this memorial.

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:37.526
Working with Jake Barton,
we produce the software tool,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.669
which allows the architects to,
first of all, generate a layout

00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:44.822
that satisfied all of those
adjacency requests,

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:47.879
but then second, make little adjustments
where they needed to

00:11:47.903 --> 00:11:50.251
to tell the stories
that they wanted to tell.

00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:55.354
So this memorial, I think,
has an incredibly timely concept

00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:58.368
in our era of social networks,

00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:02.367
because these networks -- these real-life
networks that make up people's lives --
