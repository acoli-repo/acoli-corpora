Nobody ever knows the answer
to this question.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.281
This is Bill Atkinson.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:08.412
And Bill Atkinson was responsible
for tons of things

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:10.918
that you see on your computer every day.

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.049
But I want to talk about one program
that Bill Atkinson wrote,

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.573
called HyperCard.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:19.185
Someone's cheering over there.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.414
(Laughter)

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:23.040
HyperCard was a program
that shipped with the Mac,

00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:25.633
and it was designed
for users of the computer

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:28.854
to make programs on their computers.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.102
Crazy idea today.
