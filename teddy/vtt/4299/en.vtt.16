So we're able to look at that conversation
in a couple of different views:

00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.283
this one, which shows us
the threads of conversation,

00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:06.501
and this one, which combines
that stacked view

00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:09.457
with a view that lets us see the threads.

00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:13.269
Now, the Times publishes
about 7,000 pieces of content

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.503
every month.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:17.369
So it was important for us,
when we were building this tool,

00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:19.026
to make it an exploratory one,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.257
so that people could dig through
this vast terrain of data.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:25.717
I think of it as a vehicle
that we're giving people

00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:29.214
to traverse this really big
terrain of data.

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:30.956
So here's what it really looks like,
