00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.304
So today, I work at the New York Times.

00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:35.201
I'm the data artist in residence
at the New York Times.

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.158
And I've had an opportunity at the Times

00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:39.646
to work on a variety
of really interesting projects,

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.892
two of which I'm going
to share with you today.

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:45.118
The first one, I've been working on
in conjunction with Mark Hansen.

00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:50.284
Mark Hansen is a professor of statistics
at UCLA. He's also a media artist.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:53.094
And Mark came to the Times
with a very interesting question

00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:55.778
to what may seem like an obvious problem:

00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:58.953
When people share content on the internet,

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.592
how does that content get
from person A to person B?
