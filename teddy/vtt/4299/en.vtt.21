00:10:27.373 --> 00:10:33.740
And my own story with September 11
has really become a more intricate one,

00:10:33.764 --> 00:10:35.828
because I spent a great deal of time

00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:40.001
working on a piece
of the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.094
The central idea about the 9/11 Memorial

00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:47.577
is that the names in the memorial
are not laid out in alphabetical order

00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.286
or chronological order,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.134
but instead, they're laid out in a way

00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:54.582
in which the relationships
between the people who were killed

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.566
are embodied in the memorial.

00:10:57.153 --> 00:10:59.691
Brothers are placed next to brothers,

00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:01.900
coworkers are placed together.
