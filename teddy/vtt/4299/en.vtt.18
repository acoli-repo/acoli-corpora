00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.651
because we're actually making
some probabilistic guesses

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.034
about how these things link.

00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:05.984
We're looking at some of these
pieces and making some guesses,

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:09.945
but we try to make sure that those
are as statistically rigorous as possible.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.382
Now tweets, in this case,
they become parts of stories.

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.331
They become parts of narratives.

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.775
So we are building histories here,

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.974
but they're very short-term histories.

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:25.836
And sometimes these very large cascades
are the most interesting ones,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.995
but sometimes the small ones
are also interesting.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:32.544
This is one of my favorites.
We call this the "Rabbi Cascade."
