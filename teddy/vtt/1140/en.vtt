00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.790
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.188
could see the world in the same way that we do,

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:08.114
as we're walking around being able

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:10.313
to point a phone at anything,

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:12.408
and then have it actually recognize images and objects

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.178
like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.177
from an almost infinite library of knowledge

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:20.290
and experiences and ideas.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.377
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:23.527
but now we've moved to a world

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:25.858
where actually this has become possible.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.453
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.058
