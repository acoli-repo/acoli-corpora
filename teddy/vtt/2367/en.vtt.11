00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:31.267
it's not likely to happen.

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.522
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"

00:05:34.522 --> 00:05:37.470
they're usually talking about
their own lack of imagination,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.962
and not about the unlikelihood

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:41.952
of the event that they're describing.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:45.519
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.162
It transforms our preferences.

00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.280
It reshapes our values.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.623
It alters our personalities.

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:53.190
We seem to appreciate this fact,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.751
but only in retrospect.

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.246
Only when we look backwards do we realize

00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:00.518
how much change happens in a decade.
