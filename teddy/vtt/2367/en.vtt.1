00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.276
On and on and on.

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:33.308
The question is, as a psychologist,
that fascinates me is,

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.060
why do we make decisions

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.756
that our future selves so often regret?

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.608

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:54.712
that your children seem to change by the minute

00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:57.466
but your parents seem to change by the year.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.886
But what is the name of this magical point in life
