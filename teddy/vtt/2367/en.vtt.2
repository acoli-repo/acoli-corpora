00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.886
But what is the name of this magical point in life

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:02.922
where change suddenly goes

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.704

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.444
has just come to an end,

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:27.051
that we have just recently become

00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.206
the people that we were always meant to be
