00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:02.618
At every stage of our lives

00:00:02.618 --> 00:00:06.186
we make decisions that will profoundly influence

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:08.072
the lives of the people we're going to become,

00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.692
and then when we become those people,

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:12.110
we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.624
So young people pay good money

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:17.328
to get tattoos removed that teenagers

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:18.698
paid good money to get.

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:21.206
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.823
who young adults rushed to marry.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.460
Older adults work hard to lose

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.276
On and on and on.
