00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.513
how much their values had
changed in the last 10 years.

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.980
And this enabled us to do a really
interesting kind of analysis,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.191
because it allowed us to compare the predictions

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.185
of people, say, 18 years old,

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.297
to the reports of people who were 28,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.917
and to do that kind of analysis
throughout the lifespan.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.248
Here's what we found.

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:16.541
First of all, you are right,

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.389
change does slow down as we age,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.281
but second, you're wrong,

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.679
because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.542
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.252
people vastly underestimated how much change
