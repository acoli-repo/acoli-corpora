00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.583
and here it is again:

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.663
people predict that the friend they have now

00:04:04.663 --> 00:04:06.211
is the friend they'll have in 10 years,

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.316
the vacation they most enjoy now is the one

00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:09.648
they'll enjoy in 10 years,

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.390
and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.319
"Eh, you know, that's really changed."

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.475
Does any of this matter?

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.635
Is this just a form of mis-prediction
that doesn't have consequences?

00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:22.557
No, it matters quite a bit, and
I'll give you an example of why.

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:26.022
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:27.727
Bring to mind right now for yourself

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:30.000
your favorite musician today

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.368
and your favorite musician 10 years ago.
