00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:01.260
that there are five fundamental
dimensions of personality:

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.527
neuroticism, openness to experience,

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:07.375
agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.622
Again, we asked people how much they expected

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.198
to change over the next 10 years,

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:14.559
and also how much they had
changed over the last 10 years,

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:15.475
and what we found,

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:18.030
well, you're going to get used to
seeing this diagram over and over,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.069
because once again the rate of change

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.679
does slow as we age,

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.567
but at every age, people underestimate

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.900
how much their personalities will change

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.684
in the next decade.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:32.005
And it isn't just ephemeral things
