00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:00.518
how much change happens in a decade.

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:02.197
It's as if, for most of us,

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:04.366
the present is a magic time.

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.383
It's a watershed on the timeline.

00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:08.727
It's the moment at which we finally

00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:11.230
become ourselves.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.923
Human beings are works in progress

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:16.846
that mistakenly think they're finished.

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.636
The person you are right now

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:22.338
is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary

00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.997
as all the people you've ever been.

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:28.545
The one constant in our life is change.

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:30.641
Thank you.
