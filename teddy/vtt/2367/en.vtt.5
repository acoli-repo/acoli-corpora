00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.252
people vastly underestimated how much change

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.171
they would experience over the next 10 years.

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:38.105
We call this the "end of history" illusion.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.488
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:41.710
you can connect these two lines,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.474
and what you see here is that 18-year-olds

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:46.943
anticipate changing only as much

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:49.928
as 50-year-olds actually do.

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:53.482
Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.300
For example, personality.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.966
Many of you know that psychologists now claim

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:01.260
that there are five fundamental
dimensions of personality:
