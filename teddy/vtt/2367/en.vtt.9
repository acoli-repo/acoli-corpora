00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:30.000
your favorite musician today

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.368
and your favorite musician 10 years ago.

00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:34.927
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.

00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:36.530
Now we asked people

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.767
to predict for us, to tell us

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.654
how much money they would pay right now

00:04:41.654 --> 00:04:43.990
to see their current favorite musician

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.507
perform in concert 10 years from now,

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:48.554
and on average, people said they would pay

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.271
129 dollars for that ticket.

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.198
And yet, when we asked them
how much they would pay

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.519
to see the person who was their favorite

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.558
10 years ago perform today,

00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:00.400
they say only 80 dollars.
