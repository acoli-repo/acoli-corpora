00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.206
the people that we were always meant to be

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.652
and will be for the rest of our lives.

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:34.756
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:37.910
So here's a study of change in people's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.942
personal values over time.

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:41.141
Here's three values.

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.656
Everybody here holds all of them,

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.814
but you probably know that as you grow,

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.173
as you age, the balance of these values shifts.

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.082
So how does it do so?

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.090
Well, we asked thousands of people.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.877
We asked half of them to predict for us

00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:56.887
how much their values would
change in the next 10 years,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:58.263
and the others to tell us

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.513
how much their values had
changed in the last 10 years.
