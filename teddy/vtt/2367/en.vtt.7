And it isn't just ephemeral things

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.859
like values and personality.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.874
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.328
their basic preferences.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.130

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.158
"Did that change over the last 10 years?"

00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:59.741
