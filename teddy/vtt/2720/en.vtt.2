00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.539
and it really matters
to the way that we live.

00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:04.702
When I came home,
I was instantly frustrated,

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:08.652
stuck in traffic as I crossed
the top end of our perimeter highway.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.943
Not only was I not moving a muscle,

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:12.612
I had no social interaction

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:15.875
with the hundreds of thousands of people
that were hurtling past me,

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.896
like me, with their eyes faced forward
and their music blaring.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.562
I wondered if this was
an inevitable outcome,

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:25.405
or could we do something about it.

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:29.045
Was it possible to transform
this condition in Atlanta

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.444
into the kind of place
that I wanted to live in?
