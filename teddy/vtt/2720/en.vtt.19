00:09:28.574 --> 00:09:30.999
often include the seemingly unstoppable

00:09:31.023 --> 00:09:35.508
and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,
prices and rents.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.308
This is urgent.

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:39.474
If we care, we have to stand up

00:09:39.498 --> 00:09:40.815
and speak out.

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:42.622
This should be a call to action,

00:09:42.646 --> 00:09:45.706
because the answer can't be
to not improve communities.

00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:51.191
The answer can't be to not build parks
and transit and grocery stores.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.128
The answer can't be
to hold communities down

00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.905
just to keep them affordable.

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:59.800
But we do have to follow through
and address the financial realities

00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:01.054
that we're facing.
