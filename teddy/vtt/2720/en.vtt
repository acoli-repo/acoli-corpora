This picture

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:04.349
is from my metro card

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:08.413
when I spent a year abroad in Paris
in college in the mid-'90s.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.970
My friend says I look
like a French anarchist --

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:13.001
(Laughter)

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:14.372
But this is still what I see

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.563
when I look in the mirror in the morning.

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:19.686
Within a month of living in Paris,
I'd lost 15 pounds

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.745
and I was in the best shape of my life

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.766
because I was eating fresh food

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.067
and I was walking wherever I went.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:28.639
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.068
a region built largely
by highways and automobiles
