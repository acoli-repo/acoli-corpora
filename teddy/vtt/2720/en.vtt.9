00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:32.673
I had to take my kids with me
to the grocery store

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:34.369
and they were complaining about it,

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:36.441
because they didn't want
to get in the car.

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:40.465
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.218
can we at least ride our bikes?"

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.548
And I said, "Of course we can.

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:46.607
That's what people in Atlanta do.

We ride our bikes to the grocery store."

00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:50.307

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.931
(Applause)

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:53.210
Thank you, yeah.

00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:55.965
Now, they don't know
how ridiculous that is,

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:57.660
but I do.

00:04:57.684 --> 00:05:01.693
And I also understand
that their expectations for Atlanta
