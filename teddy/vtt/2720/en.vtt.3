00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.444
into the kind of place
that I wanted to live in?

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:35.045
I went back to grad school
in architecture and city planning,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.401
developed this interest in infrastructure,

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:40.018
and in 1999 came up with an idea

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.607
for my thesis project:

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.948
the adaptation of an obsolete loop
of old railroad circling downtown

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.012
as a new infrastructure
for urban revitalization.

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:50.442
It was just an idea.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.191
I never thought
we would actually build it.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.699
But I went to work
at an architecture firm,

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:59.246
and eventually talked
to my coworkers about it,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.038
and they loved the idea.
