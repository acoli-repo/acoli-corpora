00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.132
that fundamentally changed
not only the way that we build cities,

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:32.170
but it changed our expectations

00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:33.534
for our lives.

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:37.864
These changes were the foundations
for urban sprawl.

00:05:37.888 --> 00:05:40.002
We didn't call it sprawl at that time.

00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:41.553
We called it the future.

00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:42.967
And it was.

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.042
And we got all the highways
and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.

It was a radical transformation,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.433
but it was built by a cultural momentum.

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:54.031
So it's important to not separate

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:56.529
the physical construction
of the places we live

00:05:56.553 --> 00:05:59.244
from other things that
are happening at that time.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.796
At that time,
