We're building new lives for ourselves.

00:08:40.214 --> 00:08:43.768
It's a movement that includes
local food, urban agriculture,

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:46.038
craft beer, the maker movement,

in the way we build cities.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.082
We're taking places like this

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:58.654
and transforming them into this.
