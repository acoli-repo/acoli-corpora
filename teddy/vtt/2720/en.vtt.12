00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:05.097

00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.990
and lifting us to the moon,

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:09.545
and the sexual revolution
was breaking down barriers,

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.681

began its march

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.640
toward the fulfillment
of our nation's promise.

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:19.401
Television, entertainment, food, travel,
business -- everything was changing,

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:22.725
and both the public
and private sectors were colluding

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.994
to give us the lives we wanted.

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.750
The Federal Highway Administration,

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:31.071
for example, didn't exist
before there were highways.
