00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.306
People on the lower end
of the economic spectrum loved it, too.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.520
They were just afraid
they weren't going to be able to be there

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:35.713
when it got built,
that they'd be priced out.

00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:38.820
And we've all heard
that kind of story before, right?

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:42.914
But we promised that
the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.972
and people took ownership of the idea,

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.570
and they made it better
than anything we ever imagined

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.795
in the beginning,

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.079
including significant
subsidies for housing,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:56.912
new parks, art, an arboretum --
a list that continues to grow.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.102
And we put in place

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:01.749
the organizations and agencies
that were required to make it happen.
