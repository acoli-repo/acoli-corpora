00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:01.054
that we're facing.

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.534
This is hard, and it won't

00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:06.770
We can do it, and I'm committed

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.794
We can't call it a success without them.

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:15.412

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:24.109
They're people that I love.

00:10:24.974 --> 00:10:27.508
So even though it started
as my graduate thesis

00:10:27.532 --> 00:10:30.504
and I'm working hard for 16 years
with thousands of people
