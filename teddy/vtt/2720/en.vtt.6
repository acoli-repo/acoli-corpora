00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.353
but it was really, really powerful.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.770
The people of Atlanta
fell in love with a vision

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.098
that was better than what they saw
through their car windshields,

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.624
and the people of Atlanta made it happen,

00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:19.865
and I guarantee you we would not
be building it otherwise.

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:23.319
From the beginning,

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:26.466
People of all stripes
were part of our story.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.306
People on the lower end
of the economic spectrum loved it, too.
