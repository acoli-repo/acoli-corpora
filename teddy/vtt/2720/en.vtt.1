00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.068
a region built largely
by highways and automobiles

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.753
and with a reputation
as a poster child for sprawl,

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.339
Paris fundamentally changed
the way I understood

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.083
the construction of the world around me,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.936
and I got obsessed with the role
of infrastructure --

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.713
that it's not just the way to move people
from point A to point B,

00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:52.826
it's not just the way to convey water
or sewage or energy,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.420
but it's the foundation for our economy.

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:58.807
It's the foundation for our social life
and for our culture,

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.539
and it really matters
to the way that we live.
