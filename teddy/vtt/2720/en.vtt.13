for example, didn't exist
before there were highways.

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:32.972
Think about it.

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:34.020
(Laughter)

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:37.031
Of course, today it's important
to understand and acknowledge

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:39.850
that those benefits accrued
to some groups of people

00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:41.146
and not to others.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.920
It was not an equitable cultural momentum.

00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:48.358
But when we look today
in wonder and disgust, maybe,

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.621
we wonder if we're stuck.

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.708
Are we stuck with the legacy
of that inequity?

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:59.837
Are we stuck with this dystopian
traffic hellscape?
