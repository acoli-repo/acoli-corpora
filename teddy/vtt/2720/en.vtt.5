00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:33.851
Together, we built this amazing movement
of people and ideas.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.998
It included community advocates
who were used to fighting against things,

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:41.335
but found the Atlanta BeltLine
as something that they could fight for;

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.084
developers who saw the opportunity

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:46.043
to take advantage of a lot
of new growth in the city;

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:50.713
and dozens of nonprofit partners
who saw their mission

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.857
at least partly accomplished
by the shared vision.

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:59.118
Now, usually these groups of people
aren't at the same table

00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:00.710
wanting the same outcome.
