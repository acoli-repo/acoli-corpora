00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.038
and they loved the idea.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:03.448
And as we started talking
to more people about it,

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:05.500
more people wanted to hear about it.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.888
In the summer of 2001,

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.896
we connected with Cathy Woolard,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.051
who was soon elected
city council president.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:15.501
And we built a citywide vision
around this idea:

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.456
the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.334
of transit and trails and transformation.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:26.059
I was doing two and three meetings a week
for two and a half years,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.528
and so was Cathy and her staff
and a handful of volunteers.

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:33.851
Together, we built this amazing movement
of people and ideas.
