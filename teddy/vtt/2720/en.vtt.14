00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:03.455
Are we stuck with rampant
urban displacement,

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.861
with environmental degradation?

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:09.037
Are we stuck with social isolation

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.021
or political polarization?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.165
Are these the inevitable
and permanent outcomes?

00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:17.722
Or are they the result
of our collective cultural decisions

00:07:17.746 --> 00:07:19.462
that we've made for ourselves?

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:21.804
And if they are,

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:24.071
can't we change them?

00:07:24.803 --> 00:07:27.437
What I have learned
from our experience in Atlanta

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.970
is not an anomaly.

00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:31.365
