00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:33.768
I noticed that blue was the most
prevalent color among the plastic.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:37.096
Purple is actually the most rare color.
It's kind of like gold to me.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.619
But blue is the most prevalent,

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.337
and so I gathered some of the blues

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:43.055
and made this little arrangement
in front of the blue sky

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.965
and blue Caribbean waters.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.686
And when I took a photograph
and looked at the test shot,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.508
it was like a lightning bolt
hit me in that moment,

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:52.562
and I knew I was going
to have to come back

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:56.114
to create a whole series
of installations on location

00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:57.762
and photograph them.

00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.648
So this turned out to be a sketch

00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:03.739
for a work that I completed
three years later.
