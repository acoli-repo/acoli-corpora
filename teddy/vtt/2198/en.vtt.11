00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:30.471
And as this community
around the project grows

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.597
and as my trash collection grows,

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.007
I really believe that
the impact will as well.

00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.297
And so, over the years,

00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:41.354
I've become a little obsessed
with my trash collection.

00:05:41.378 --> 00:05:45.113
I pack it into suitcases
and travel with it.

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.252
I take it on vacation with me.

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:48.673
(Laughter)

00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:50.586
And in the latest work,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.781
I've begun to break the two-dimensional
plane of the photograph.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:56.908
I'm really excited about this new work.

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:59.736
I see these as living artworks

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.692
that will morph and grow over time.
