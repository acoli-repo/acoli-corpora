00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.530
And in the background, if you can see
that blue little bottle cap,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:03.928
at the time that I found it,

00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:06.511
it was actually the home
to this little hermit crab.

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:07.830
This guy is so cute.

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:09.142
(Laughter)

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.040
(Laughter)

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.538
And it's these fascinating objects,

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:19.750
but also horrifying objects,

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:21.295
each with their own history,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.432
that I use to make my ephemeral,
environmental artworks.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:28.252
And it all started with this image
in February of 2010,

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.893
when I first visited Sian Ka'an.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:33.768
I noticed that blue was the most
prevalent color among the plastic.
