00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.351
and to take those in.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.139
But it's by making aesthetic --
some might say beautiful -- arrangements

00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:05.622
out of the world's waste,

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.300
that I'm trying to hook the viewer

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:11.571
to draw in those that might be numb
to the horrors of the world

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:15.459
and give them a different way
to understand what's happening.

00:04:15.483 --> 00:04:17.996
Some have described
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.155
as an island twice the size of Texas,

00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:22.170
but I've been told that it's hard to see

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:23.701
because it's more like a smog.

00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:25.806
So through my artwork,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.738
I attempt to depict the reality
of what's happening with our environment

00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:32.258
and to make the invisible visible.
