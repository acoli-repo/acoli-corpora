00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:03.739
for a work that I completed
three years later.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:06.117
I had no idea that almost 10 years later,

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:08.859
almost a decade later,
I'd still be working on it.

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:10.780
But the problem persists.

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:13.282
So I'm going to show you
some of the images

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:17.972
from the series that I called "Washed Up:
Transforming a Trashed Landscape."

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.747
Please keep in mind that
I do not paint the garbage.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.513
I'm collecting it
and organizing it by color

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.298
on the same beaches where I find it.
