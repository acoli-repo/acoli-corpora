00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.692
that will morph and grow over time.

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:06.696
Although my greatest wish
is that I run out of the raw material

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.096
for this work,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.399
we're not there yet.

00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:11.269
So in the next phase of the project,

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:13.698
I plan on continuing the community work

00:06:13.722 --> 00:06:16.246
and making my own work
at a much larger scale,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.017
because the problem is massive.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.243
Eight million tons of plastic waste
enter our oceans every year,

00:06:26.267 --> 00:06:28.001
destroying ecosystems.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:33.651
Right now, as I speak, there's literally
an oil spill of plastic happening.
