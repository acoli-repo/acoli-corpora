00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:38.330
This is my precious trash pile
as seen in 2015

00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:41.849
after putting on a first edition
of the "Museo de la Basura,"

00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:43.861
or "Museum of Garbage."

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.522
It's fully my intention
to care for this garbage,

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:48.701
to exalt it,

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:49.876
put it on a pedestal

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.227
and to curate it.

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.710
We have all seen devastating images

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.097
of animals dying
with plastic in their bellies.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.922
And it's so important for us
to really see those

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.351
and to take those in.
