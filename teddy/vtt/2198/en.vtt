This is Sian Ka'an.

00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:07.664
Just south of Tulum
on Mexico's Caribbean coast,

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:10.041
it's a federally protected reserve,

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.204
a UNESCO World Heritage Site

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:15.133
and one of the most biodiverse
regions on the planet.

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:17.138
But when I first visited in 2010,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.094
I was horrified and completely confused

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:22.565
as to why the beach was covered in trash.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.653
I soon realized that it was floating in
from all over the world.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:29.808
I've since returned,
after that first journey,

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.229
several times a year
