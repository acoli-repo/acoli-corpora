00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:02.245
collect and organize and clean this trash,

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:03.445
that I should keep it.

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:06.187
And so that's the plan,

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.875
to use it and to reuse it endlessly

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:10.396
to make more artwork

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.062
and to engage communities
in environmental art-making.

00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:18.845
This is an example of a community-based
artwork that we did last year

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.422
with the local youth
of Punta Allen in Sian Ka'an.

00:05:22.446 --> 00:05:26.072
A key part of the community work
are the beach cleans

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:27.914
and education programming.

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:30.471
And as this community
around the project grows
