Right now, as I speak, there's literally
an oil spill of plastic happening.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:40.044
I see this project as a plea for help
and a call to action.

00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:42.845
Our health and future
is inextricably linked

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.129
to that of our oceans.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:48.533
I call the project "Washed Up:
Transforming a Trashed Landscape,"

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:50.391
but it's actually transformed me

00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:53.724
and made me rethink
my own behaviors and consumption.

00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:56.974
And if it can help anybody else
gain more awareness,

00:06:56.998 --> 00:06:58.936
then it will have been worthwhile.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.111
Thank you so much.
