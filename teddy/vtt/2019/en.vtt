00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My doctors told me that my lung capacity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
had gone down to 70 percent,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and it was killing me.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With the help of IIT,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
TERI, and learnings from NASA,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we discovered that there are three

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
basic green plants,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
common green plants, with which

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we can grow all the fresh air

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we need indoors to keep us healthy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've also found that you can

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
reduce the fresh air requirements
