00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The third plant is money plant,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and this is again a very common plant;

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
preferably grows in hydroponics.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and other volatile chemicals.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
With these three plants,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you can grow all the fresh air you need.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In fact, you could be in a bottle

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and you would not need any fresh air.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We have tried these plants at our

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
own building in Delhi, which is a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.
