00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Our studies have found that there is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
going up by one percent if one stays indoors

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in this building for 10 hours.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The government of India has discovered

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or published a study to show

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And the study showed that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
compared to other buildings,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
there is a reduced incidence of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
eye irritation by 52 percent,
