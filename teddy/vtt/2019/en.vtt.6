00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We are now replicating this in a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
1.75-million-square-feet building,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Why is this important?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It is also important for the environment,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
because the world's energy

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
requirements are expected to grow

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
by 30 percent in the next decade.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
40 percent of the world's energy is taken

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
up by buildings currently,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and 60 percent of the world's population

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
will be living in buildings in cities

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.
