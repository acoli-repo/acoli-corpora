Both my mom and I
required physical therapy,

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:05.266
a process of doing a suite
of repetitive exercises

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.794
in order to regain the range of movement
lost due to an accident or injury.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:12.171
At first, a physical therapist
works with patients,

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.134
but then it's up to the patients
to do their exercises at home.

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:18.923
But patients find physical therapy
boring, frustrating, confusing

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:21.844
and lengthy before seeing results.

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:26.837
Sadly, patient noncompliance
can be as high as 70 percent.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.226
This means the majority of patients
don't do their exercises
