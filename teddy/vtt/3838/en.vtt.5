00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.929
When designing a game,
we speak to physical therapists at first

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.856
to understand what movement
patients need to do.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.527
We then make that a video game

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:40.722
to give patients simple,
motivating objectives to follow.

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:43.239
But the software is very customizable,

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.652
and physical therapists can also
create their own exercises.

00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:49.183
Using the software, my physical therapist

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.471
recorded herself performing
a shoulder abduction,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.664
which is one of the movements
my mom had to do

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:55.361
when she had frozen shoulder.

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.819
I can follow my therapist's example
on the left side of the screen,

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.511
while on the right, I see myself
doing the recommended movement.
