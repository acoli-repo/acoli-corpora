00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.226
This means the majority of patients
don't do their exercises

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:34.011
and therefore take
a lot longer to get better.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:36.797
All physical therapists agree
that special exercises

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.957
reduce the time needed for recovery,

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.333
but patients lack
the motivation to do them.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:46.898
So together with three friends,
all of us software geeks,

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.987
we asked ourselves,

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:53.585
wouldn't it be interesting if patients
could play their way to recovery?

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.441
We started building MIRA,
A P.C. software platform

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.339
that uses this Kinect device,
a motion capture camera,

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.072
to transform traditional exercises
into video games.
