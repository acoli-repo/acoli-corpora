When I was growing up, I really 
liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:10.492
One time, though, I thought climbing
a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,

00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:13.395
but I fell and broke my arm.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.478
I actually started first grade
with a big cast all over my torso.

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:22.323
It was taken off six weeks later,
but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.376
and I had to do physical therapy
to flex and extend it,

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.271
100 times per day, seven days per week.

00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:32.063
I barely did it, because
I found it boring and painful,
