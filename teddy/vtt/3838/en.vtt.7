00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.767
I bid for the items I want to buy.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:33.880
(Laughter)

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.875
In two days, my grandmother
will be 82 years old,

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.290
and there's a 50 percent chance
for people over 80

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.171
to fall at least once per year,

00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.259
which could lead to a broken hip
or even worse.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.415
Poor muscle tone and impaired balance
are the number one cause of falls,

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.526
so reversing these problems
through targeted exercise

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:54.196
will help keep older people
like my grandmother

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:57.029
safer and independent for longer.

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.514
When my schedule ends,
MIRA briefly shows me

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.693
how I progressed throughout my session.
