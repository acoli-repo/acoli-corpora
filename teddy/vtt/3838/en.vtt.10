00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:05.607
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me
what hardware is this

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.470
that they're rapidly putting away?

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.710
What is that made of,
and how much does it cost?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.789
Cosmin Milhau: So it's
a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.534
but you just need a computer
and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:19.981
TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing
that people use for their Xboxes

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:21.052
to do 3D games, right?

00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:24.113
CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,
you only need a camera.

00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:26.875
TR: Right, so this is less
than a $1,000 solution.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.458
CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,
you can definitely use it.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.254
TR: So right now, you're doing
clinical trials in clinics.
