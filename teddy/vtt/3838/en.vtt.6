00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.511
while on the right, I see myself
doing the recommended movement.

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:04.554
I feel more engaged and confident,

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:07.015
as I'm exercising alongside my therapist

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:10.870
with the exercises my therapist
thinks are best for me.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.795
This basically extends the application
for physical therapists

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:18.323
to create whatever exercises
they think are best.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:21.574
This is an auction house game
for preventing falls,

00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:24.569
designed to strengthen muscles
and improve balance.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.564
As a patient, I need to do
sit and stand movements,

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:29.422
and when I stand up,

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.767
I bid for the items I want to buy.
