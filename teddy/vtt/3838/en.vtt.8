00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.693
how I progressed throughout my session.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:05.620
I have just shown you
three different games

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.113
for kids, adults and seniors.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.942
These can be used with orthopedic
or neurologic patients,

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.886
but we'll soon have options
for children with autism,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.311
mental health or speech therapy.

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.999
My physical therapist
can go back to my profile

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.990
and see the data gathered
during my sessions.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.660
She can see how much I moved,
how many points I scored,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.610
with what speed I moved my joints,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.841
and so on.

00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:31.118
My physical therapist can use all of this
to adapt my treatment.
