00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's unfair.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I would say, at least do this --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
10 years is enough to follow the trend.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
They have 2.4 percent.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I may have joined these two points.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So what I'm telling you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is that we know the child mortality.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We have a decent trend.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's coming into some tricky things then

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
when we are measuring MDGs.
