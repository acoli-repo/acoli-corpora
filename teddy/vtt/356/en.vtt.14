00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Still here,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
child death per 1,000 on that axis.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Here we have [the] year.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I start 50 years ago

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I give you Congo, which was high,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You can see, with independence, literacy improved

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
hygiene was improved, and things got better.
