00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
this axis here is child mortality --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and here I have the family size.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
The relationship between child mortality and family size.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
One, two, three, four children per woman:

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
six, seven, eight children per woman.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This is, once again, 1960 --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
50 years ago.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Each bubble is a country --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the color, you can see, a continent.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And the size of the bubble is the population.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And these are

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the so-called "developing" countries.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They had high, or very high, child mortality
