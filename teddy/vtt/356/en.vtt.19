00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
are long-term investments.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's not about just five years --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it's long-term investments.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
3.1 percent when I calculated.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
But you don't talk about it so much.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Let me show you Thailand,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
how they went down here

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.
