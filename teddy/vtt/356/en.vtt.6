00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then this is done in a representative sample

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of thousands of women in the country

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and put together in what used to be called

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a demographic health survey report.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But these surveys are costly,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But they have good quality.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So this is a limitation.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And all these colored lines here are results;

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
each color is one survey.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and I give you one average point for each survey.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This was 1977, 1988,
