00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
What is the importance now with the relations here.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Look -- even if we look in Africa --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
these are the African countries.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and decreasing family size,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
even within Africa.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's very clear that this is what happens.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
showing that almost 50 percent

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of the fall in child mortality

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
can be attributed to female education.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That is, when we get girls in school,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,
