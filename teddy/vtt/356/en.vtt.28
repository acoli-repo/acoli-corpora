00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That is, when we get girls in school,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which is a secular trend which is very strong.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That's why we must have that long-term perspective,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but we must measure the impact

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
over 10-year periods.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It's fully possible

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to get child mortality down in all of these countries

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and to get them down in the corner

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
where we all would like to live together.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And of course, lowering child mortality

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
is a matter of utmost importance

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
from humanitarian aspects.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a decent life for children,
