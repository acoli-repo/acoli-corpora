00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
hygiene was improved, and things got better.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But then, in the '80s, watch out here.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Congo got into civil war,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and they leveled off here.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Ghana got very ahead, fast.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
still a standstill in Congo.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
That's where we are today.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You can see it doesn't make sense

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to make an average of this zero improvement

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and this very fast improvement.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Time has come
