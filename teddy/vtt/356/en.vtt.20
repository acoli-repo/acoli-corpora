00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Egypt was up here in 1960,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
higher than Congo.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The Nile Delta was a misery for children

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
with diarrheal disease

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and malaria and a lot of problems.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
they increased education

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and they got primary health care.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And down they went, you know.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And isn't it a success story.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
