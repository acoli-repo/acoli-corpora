00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This was 1977, 1988,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
1992, '97

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and 2002.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And when the experts in the U.N.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
have got these surveys in place in their database,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
then they use advanced mathematical formulas

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But watch out --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they continue the line

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
beyond the last point

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
out into nothing.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And they estimated that in 2008,
