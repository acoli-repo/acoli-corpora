00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and child mortality came down.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But look, the rate of lowering

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in Sweden

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
was not fast.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Sweden achieved a low child mortality

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because we started early.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We had primary school actually

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
started in 1842.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And then you get that wonderful effect

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when we got female literacy

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
one generation later.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
are long-term investments.
