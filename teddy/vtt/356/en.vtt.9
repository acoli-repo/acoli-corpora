00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then it just took another three months

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and on Friday we got the new trend line --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it was down here.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and I saw the death rate fall

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
from 128 to 84 just that morning.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So we celebrated.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But now, when you have this trend line,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
how do we measure progress?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I'm going into some details here,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because [the] U.N. do it like this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."
