00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
still don't have that level of organization.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It exists, but it's not complete

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because so many deaths occur in the home

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
with the family,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and it's not registered.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We have interviews, we have surveys.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And this is highly professional

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
female interviewers

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
who sit down for one hour with a woman

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and ask her about [her] birth history.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
How many children did you have?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Are they alive?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If they died, at what age and what year?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then this is done in a representative sample
