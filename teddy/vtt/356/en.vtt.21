00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is fully possible.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the good thing is

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that Ghana today is going with the same rate

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
as Egypt did at its fastest.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Kenya is now speeding up.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Here we have a problem.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a wider picture of child mortality.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I'm going to show you the relationship

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
between child mortality on this axis here --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
this axis here is child mortality --
