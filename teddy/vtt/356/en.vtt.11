00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's coming into some tricky things then

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
when we are measuring MDGs.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And the reason here for Africa is especially important,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because '90s was a bad decade,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
not only in Kenya, but across Africa.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The HIV epidemic peaked.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We got, later, the mosquito netting.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And there was socio-economic problems,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which are now being solved at a much better scale.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So look at the average here --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And [the] U.N. says

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.
