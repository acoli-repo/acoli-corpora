00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We are here today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
because [the] United Nations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
have defined goals

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the progress of countries.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They're called Millennium Development Goals.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the reason I really like these goals

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is that there are eight of them.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And by specifying eight different goals,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the United Nations has said

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that there are so many things needed

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to change in a country

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in order to get the good life for people.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Look here -- you have to end poverty,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
education, gender,
