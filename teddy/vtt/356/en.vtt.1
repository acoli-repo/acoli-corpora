00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
education, gender,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
child and maternal health,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
control infections, protect the environment

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and get the good global links between nations

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in every aspect

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
from aid to trade.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There's a second reason I like these development goals,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and that is because each and every one is measured.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Take child mortality;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the aim here is to reduce child mortality

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
by two-thirds,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from 1990 to 2015.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's a four percent reduction per year --
