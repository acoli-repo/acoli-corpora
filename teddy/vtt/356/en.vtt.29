00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
from humanitarian aspects.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a decent life for children,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
we are talking about.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But it is also a strategic investment

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in the future of all mankind,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
because it's about the environment.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We will not be able to manage the environment

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and avoid the terrible climate crisis

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
if we don't stabilize the world population.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Let's be clear about that.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And the way to do that,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and behind that drive female education.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And that is fully possible. Let's do it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Thank you very much.
