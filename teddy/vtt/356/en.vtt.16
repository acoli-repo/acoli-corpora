00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Time has come

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Their countries are so different,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and they merit to be recognized in the same way,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
as we don't talk about Europe as one place.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
everyone knows that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So let me show the wider picture.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
My country, Sweden:

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
1800, we were up there.
