00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's a four percent reduction per year --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and this, with measuring.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's what makes the difference

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
between political talking like this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and really going for the important thing,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a better life for people.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And what I'm so happy about with this

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is that we have already documented

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that there are many countries

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in Asia, in the Middle East,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in Latin America and East Europe

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that [are] reducing with this rate.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and Turkey with seven percent per year.
