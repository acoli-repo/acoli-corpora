00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and Turkey with seven percent per year.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So there's good news.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And there's not even statistics on Africa

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to know what is happening."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'll prove them wrong on both points.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
where you can take deaths in children

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
below five years of age for all countries --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it's done by U.N. specialists.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I will take Kenya as an example.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here you see the data.
