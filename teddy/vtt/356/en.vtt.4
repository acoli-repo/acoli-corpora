00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here you see the data.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It looks nasty, like in college

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
when you didn't like statistics.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But first thing, when you see dots like this,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you have to ask yourself:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
from where do the data come?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
What is the origin of the data?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Is it so that in Kenya,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
there are doctors and other specialists

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
who write the death certificate at the death of the child

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it's sent to the statistical office?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
No -- low-income countries like Kenya

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
still don't have that level of organization.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It exists, but it's not complete
