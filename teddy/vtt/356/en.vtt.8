00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And they estimated that in 2008,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Kenya had per child mortality of 128.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I was sad,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because we could see

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
this reversal in Kenya

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with an increased child mortality in the 90s.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It was so tragic.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
from Demographic Health Surveys,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and it showed good news from Kenya.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I was so happy.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This was the estimate of the new survey.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then it just took another three months

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,
