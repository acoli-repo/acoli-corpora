00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
An economist would never do that.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I have just divided it into two periods.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
only 1.2 percent.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Whereas now, second gear --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
it's like Africa had first gear,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
now they go into second gear.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But even this

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is not a fair representation of Africa,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because it's an average,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.
