00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They had high, or very high, child mortality

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and family size, six to eight.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the ones over there,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
they were so-called Western countries.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000

This is what happened. Now I start the world.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Here we come down with the eradication of
