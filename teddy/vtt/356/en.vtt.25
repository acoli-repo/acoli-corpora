00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
There is no such thing

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
as a "Western world" and "developing world."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This is the report from [the] U.N.,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
which came out on Friday.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
except this page.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This page is very bad;

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
it's a categorization of countries.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Huh?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
They have here Singapore.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.
