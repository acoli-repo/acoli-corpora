00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.582
I am a planet hunter

00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:06.002
and keeper of the keys
at NASA's Exoplanet Archive.

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:12.216
In March 2022, we reached
a major milestone in space exploration:

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.178
5,000 known exoplanets.

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:17.930
For thousands of years,

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:21.267
we've wondered about planets
outside of our solar system,

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.102
now called exoplanets.

00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:27.023
But our technology only recently
caught up with our imaginations.

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:30.902
And yes, 5,000 planets is incredible.
