00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I got my start

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in writing and research

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as a surgical trainee,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as someone who was a long ways away

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the natural question you ask then at that point

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it became a question of,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how do we all get good

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
at what we're trying to do?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
try to learn all the material you have to absorb
