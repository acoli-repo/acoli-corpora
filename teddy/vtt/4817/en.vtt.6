00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:02.507
followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:03.857
That's supported by evidence

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:08.284
which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:13.996
is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians.

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.187
Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:21.705
because it actually provides
an important advantage.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.325
They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.826
and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles,

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:32.835
or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals.
