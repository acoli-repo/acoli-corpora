00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.692
It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic."

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.603
To date, there is no known function
for hiccups.

00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:40.652
They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage.

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:46.972
Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs?

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.279
Anatomical structures,

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.712
or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.874
present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists.

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:59.493
Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered?

00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:02.454
Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past,
