00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:02.454
Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past,

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.523
having once served some important purpose

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:09.517
only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants?

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:11.285
One idea is that hiccups began

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.803
many millions of years
before the appearance of humans.

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:19.155
The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish,

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.394
many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen,

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:28.144
to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead.

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:31.414
When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land,
