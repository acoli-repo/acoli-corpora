Let's look at what happens when we hiccup.

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:05.623
It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm,

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.142
the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.611
that we use to inhale air.

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:15.361
This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.032
and the opening between them,

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:19.082
which is called the glottis.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:23.263
The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air,

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:27.250
but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.922
and reaching the lungs.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.692
It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic."
