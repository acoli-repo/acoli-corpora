00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:34.381
50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:37.601
So what causes hiccups?

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:41.871
Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.781
that stretch the stomach,

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.052
like swallowing air

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:48.176
or too rapid eating or drinking.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:51.616
Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.442
or a response to them:

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:54.172
laughing,

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:54.900
sobbing,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.846
anxiety,

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.641
and excitement.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.324
Let's look at what happens when we hiccup.
