00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:31.414
When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land,

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:36.574
they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs.

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:41.814
That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.198
as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:46.425
to adults with lungs.

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:51.414
This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:53.996
from water to land.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.975
An inhalation that could 
move water over gills

00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:02.507
followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs.
