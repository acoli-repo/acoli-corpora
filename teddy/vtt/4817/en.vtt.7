00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:32.835
or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals.

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:38.033
Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.457
and are far more common in infants
that adults.

00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:43.187
Their explanation for this

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:47.447
involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing.

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:50.737
The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals

00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:55.761
to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp.

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.607
The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach,

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:04.858
while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs.
