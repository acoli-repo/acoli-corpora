00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:05.810
In the months following
the 2009 presidential election in Iran,

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:08.728
protests erupted across the country.

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:12.581
The Iranian government
violently suppressed

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.584
what came to be known
as the Iranian Green Movement,

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:18.661
even blocking mobile signals

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.399
to cut off communication
between the protesters.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:26.985
My parents, who emigrated
to the United States in the late 1960s,

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.803
spend substantial time there,

00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:31.980
where all of my large,
extended family live.
