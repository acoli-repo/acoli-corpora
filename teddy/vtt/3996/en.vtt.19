00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:31.971
then we wouldn't have to remove
any more rainforests

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:35.429
to make the food and the goods
that we consume.

00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:38.737
Because, at a large scale,

00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:44.069
you can actually make 10,000 times
more output per land area

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:47.248
than you could -- for instance,
if you used soybeans --

00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:50.332
if you planted soybeans
on that same area of land

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.800
over a period of a year.

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.800
Ten thousand times
over a period of a year.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.859
So this is what I mean
by a new type of agriculture.
