00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:33.278
and we need solutions
if we want to scale sustainably.

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:39.677
I believe that microbes
can be a part of the answer --

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:43.684
specifically, these supercharged
carbon recyclers.

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:46.230
These supercharged carbon recyclers,

00:07:46.254 --> 00:07:50.285
like plants, serve as
the natural recyclers

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:52.430
in their ecosystems where they thrive.

00:07:52.454 --> 00:07:54.650
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.125
like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.806
In those ecosystems,
they take carbon and recycle it
