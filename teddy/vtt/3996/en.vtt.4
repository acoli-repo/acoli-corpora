00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:01.222
so you'd have to figure out
how to recycle it on board.

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:04.262
This is a clever solution, right?

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:08.529
But the thing is, that research
didn't really go anywhere.

00:02:08.553 --> 00:02:12.275
We haven't yet gone to Mars.
We haven't yet gone to another planet.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.937
And this was actually done
in the '60s and '70s.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.722
So a colleague of mine,
Dr. John Reed, and I,

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:22.717
were interested, actually,
in carbon recycling here on Earth.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.972
We wanted to come up
with technical solutions

00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:26.756
to address climate change.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.001
And we discovered this research

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:33.435
by reading some papers published
in the '60s -- 1967 and later --
