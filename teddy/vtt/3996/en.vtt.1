What if you could bring with you
just a few packets of seeds,

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:34.364
and grow crops in a matter of hours?

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:38.351
And what if those crops
would then make more seeds,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.429
enabling you to feed the entire crew

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:45.215
with just those few packets of seeds
for the duration of the trip?

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:50.751
Well, the scientists at NASA actually
figured out a way to do this.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:54.189
What they came up with
was actually quite interesting.

00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:56.109
It involved microorganisms,

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.223
which are single-celled organisms.

00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:01.068
And they also used hydrogen from water.
