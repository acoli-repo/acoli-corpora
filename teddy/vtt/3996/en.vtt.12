00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.525
Another reason is that modern ag
simply takes up a whole lot of land.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:08.748
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles
for crops and livestock.

00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:11.094
What does that look like?

00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:16.009
Well, that's roughly the size
of South America and Africa combined.

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:19.300
Let me give you a specific example.

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:24.280
In Indonesia, an amount
of virgin rainforest was cleared

00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:27.686
totaling the size
of approximately Ireland,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.305
between 2000 and 2012.
