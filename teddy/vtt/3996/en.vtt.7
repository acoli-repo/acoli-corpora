00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.631
So we began cultivating these products,
these microbes, in our lab.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:38.970
We found that we can make
essential amino acids from carbon dioxide

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:40.459
using these microbes.

00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:43.528
And we even made a protein-rich meal

00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:48.023
that has an amino acid profile
similar to what you might find

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:49.563
in some animal proteins.

00:03:50.523 --> 00:03:52.933
We began cultivating them even further,

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:54.874
and we found that we can make oil.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:57.349
Oils are used to manufacture
many products.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:01.071
We made an oil that was similar
to a citrus oil,
