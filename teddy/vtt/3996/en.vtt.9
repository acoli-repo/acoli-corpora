00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:31.696
We believe this type of technology
can indeed help us

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.070
profitably recycle carbon dioxide
into valuable products --

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.815
something that's beneficial
for the planet

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.573
but also beneficial for business.

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:42.201
That's what we're doing today.

00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:46.455
But tomorrow, this type of technology
and using these types of microbes

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.242
actually could help us
do something even greater

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:51.217
if we take it to the next level.

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:54.463
We believe that this type of technology

00:04:54.487 --> 00:04:57.726
can actually help us address
an issue with agriculture

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.275
and allow us to create
a type of agriculture that's sustainable,
