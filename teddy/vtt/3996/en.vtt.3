00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:33.892
and exhale the carbon out
in the form of carbon dioxide,

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:36.140
which would then be captured
by the microbes,

00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:37.799
to create a nutritious crop,

00:01:37.823 --> 00:01:40.718
which then would be exhaled
in the form of carbon dioxide

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.152
by the astronauts.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:45.178
So in this way, a closed-loop
carbon cycle is created.

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:47.459
So why is this important?

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.332
We need carbon to survive as humans,

00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:52.737
and we get our carbon from food.

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:54.920
On a long space journey,

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.263
you simply wouldn't be able to pick up
any carbon along the way,

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:01.222
so you'd have to figure out
how to recycle it on board.
