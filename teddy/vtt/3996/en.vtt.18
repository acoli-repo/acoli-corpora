00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.135
and in any geography and any location.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.771
They can grow in containers
that require minimal space.

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:11.516
And we can get to a type
of vertical agriculture.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.197
Instead of our traditional
horizontal agriculture

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.950
that requires so much land,

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:17.551
we can scale vertically,

00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:23.207
and as a result
produce much more product per area.

00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:28.651
If we implement this type of approach
and use these carbon recyclers,

00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:31.971
then we wouldn't have to remove
any more rainforests
