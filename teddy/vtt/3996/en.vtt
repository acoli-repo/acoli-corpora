Imagine you are a part
of a crew of astronauts

00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:09.276
traveling to Mars or some distant planet.

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:12.886
The travel time could take a year

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.379
or even longer.

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:17.773
The space on board and the resources

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:19.337
would be limited.

00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:23.948
So you and the crew would have
to figure out how to produce food

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:25.431
with minimal inputs.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.046
What if you could bring with you
just a few packets of seeds,
