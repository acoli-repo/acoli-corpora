00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:01.068
And they also used hydrogen from water.

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:05.599
The types of microbes that they used
were called hydrogenotrophs,

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:10.913
and with these hydrogenotrophs,
you can create a virtuous carbon cycle

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.755
that would sustain life
onboard a spacecraft.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.217
Astronauts would breathe out
carbon dioxide,

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.042
that carbon dioxide would then
be captured by the microbes

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.621
and converted into a nutritious,
carbon-rich crop.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:29.878
The astronauts would then eat
that carbon-rich crop

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:33.892
and exhale the carbon out
in the form of carbon dioxide,
