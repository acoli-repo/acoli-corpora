00:02:53.373 --> 00:03:00.123
can we take some of these
NASA-type ideas and apply them

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.912
to our carbon problem here on Earth?

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:05.568
Could we cultivate
these NASA-type microbes

00:03:05.592 --> 00:03:08.385
in order to make
valuable products here on Earth?

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.693
We started a company to do it.

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:16.397
And in that company, we discovered
that these hydrogenotrophs --

00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.358
which I'll actually call
nature's supercharged carbon recyclers --

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:23.201
we found that they are a powerful
class of microbes

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:27.053
that had been largely overlooked
and understudied,

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:29.782
and that they could make
some really valuable products.
