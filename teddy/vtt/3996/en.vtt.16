In those ecosystems,
they take carbon and recycle it

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.384
into the nutrients needed
for those ecosystems.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.375
And they're rich in nutrients,

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:10.604
such as oils and proteins,
minerals and carbohydrates.

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:16.557
And actually, microbes are already
an integral part of our everyday lives.

00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:29.858
If you enjoy a beer
from your local microbrewery --

00:08:29.882 --> 00:08:31.502
a product of microbes.
