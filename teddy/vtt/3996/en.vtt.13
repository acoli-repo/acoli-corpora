00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.305
between 2000 and 2012.

00:06:30.717 --> 00:06:33.923
Just think of all
of the species, the diversity,

00:06:33.947 --> 00:06:35.837
that was removed in the process,

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:38.548
whether plant life, insects
or animal life.

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:41.794
And a natural carbon sink
was also removed.

00:06:42.437 --> 00:06:44.423
So let me make this real for you.

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:48.741
This clearing happened primarily
to make room for palm plantations.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.774
And as I mentioned before,

00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:54.347
palm oil is used
to manufacture many products.

00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.298
In fact, it is estimated
that over 50 percent of consumer products

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:00.711
are manufactured using palm oil.
