00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.234
So how will we scale to meet that demand?

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.166
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot
sustainably scale to meet that demand.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.978
There are a number of reasons why.

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:46.145
One of them is that modern agriculture
is one of the largest emitters

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.750
of greenhouse gases.

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:51.397
In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases

00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:54.525
than our cars, our trucks, our planes

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:56.985
and our trains combined.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.525
Another reason is that modern ag
simply takes up a whole lot of land.
