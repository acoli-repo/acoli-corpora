in the '60s -- 1967 and later --

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.268
articles about this work.

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:38.370
And we thought it was a really good idea.

00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:41.838
So we said, well, Earth
is actually like a spaceship.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.782
We have limited space
and limited resources,

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.989
and on Earth, we really do

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:49.908
how to recycle our carbon better.

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.349
So we had the idea,

00:02:53.373 --> 00:03:00.123

NASA-type ideas and apply them
