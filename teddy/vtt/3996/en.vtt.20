And this is what I mean
by developing a system

00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:08.839
that allows us to sustainably scale
to meet the demands of 10 billion.

00:10:10.704 --> 00:10:14.299
And what would be the products
of this new type of agriculture?

00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:16.506
Well, we've already made a protein meal,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.793
so you can imagine something
similar to a soybean meal,

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:21.760
or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.

00:10:22.203 --> 00:10:23.556
We've already made oils,

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.258
so you can imagine something
similar to coconut oil

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:29.296
or olive oil or soybean oil.
