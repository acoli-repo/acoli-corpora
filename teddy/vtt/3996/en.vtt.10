00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.275
and allow us to create
a type of agriculture that's sustainable,

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:05.884
that will allow us to scale
to meet the demands of tomorrow.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:09.630
And why might we need
a sustainable agriculture?

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.513
Well, actually, it is estimated

00:05:12.537 --> 00:05:17.774
that the population will reach
about 10 billion by 2050,

00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:20.979
and we're projecting that we will need
to increase food production

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:22.575
by 70 percent.

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:26.420
In addition, we will need many more
resources and raw materials

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:28.977
to make consumer goods
and industrial goods.

00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.234
So how will we scale to meet that demand?
