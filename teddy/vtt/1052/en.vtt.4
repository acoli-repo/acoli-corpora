00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:00.874
But the story of the vending machine
is a little more interesting

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:02.285
if you know more about crows.

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.151
It turns out, crows aren't just
surviving with human beings;

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.416
they're actually thriving.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.277
They're found everywhere
on the planet except for the Arctic

00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.113
and the southern tip of South America.

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.828
And in all that area,
they're only rarely found breeding

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.171
more than five kilometers
away from human beings.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:18.945
So we may not think about them,
but they're always around.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.613
And not surprisingly,
given the human population growth,

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:24.613
more than half of the human population
is living in cities now.

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:27.452
And out of those, nine-tenths
of the human growth population

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:28.634
is occurring in cities.

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.831
We're seeing a population boom with crows.
