00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.439
But part of the reason
I found this interesting is,

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:04.295
I started noticing that we're very
aware of all the species

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.114
that are going extinct on the planet

00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:08.207
as a result of human habitation expansion,

00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:11.176
and no one seems to be paying
attention to all the species

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.268
that are actually living;
they're surviving.

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.017
And I'm talking specifically
about synanthropic species,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.719
which have adapted
specifically for human ecologies,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:22.106
species like rats
and cockroaches and crows.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.744
And as I started looking at them,
I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.160
They'd become extremely
adept at living with us.

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.857
And in return, we just tried
to kill them all the time.
