00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.108
that were all over his yard
and making a big mess.

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:32.834
And he was telling me
we ought to eradicate these things,

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:34.830
kill them, because they're making a mess.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:36.005

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.632
And after 10 years of this, my wife said,

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.276

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.795
and build the vending machine."

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:58.970
So I did.
