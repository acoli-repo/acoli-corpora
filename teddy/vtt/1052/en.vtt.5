00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.831
We're seeing a population boom with crows.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:32.900
So bird counts are indicating

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:36.072
that we might be seeing up to exponential
growth in their numbers.

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:37.743
So that's no great surprise.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.260
But what was really interesting
to me was to find out

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.107
that the birds were adapting
in a pretty unusual way.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.268
And I'll give you an example of that.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.110
This is Betty.
She's a New Caledonian crow.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.540
And these crows use sticks in the wild

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:54.198
to get insects and whatnot
out of pieces of wood.

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:56.888
Here, she's trying to get
a piece of meat out of a tube.

00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:58.555
But the researchers had a problem.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.127
They messed up and left
just a stick of wire in there.
