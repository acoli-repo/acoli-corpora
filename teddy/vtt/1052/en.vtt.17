00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:31.136
Crows, on the other hand,
show up and they try and figure it out.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.465
They know this machine
has been messing with them

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:35.511
through three different
stages of behavior.

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:36.537
(Laughter)

00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.340
They figure there must be more to it.

00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:40.173
So they poke at it and peck at it.

00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:42.351
And eventually some crow
gets a bright idea:

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:46.296
"Hey, there's lots of coins
lying around from the first stage,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.485
hops down, picks it up, drops it
in the slot, and we're off to the races.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.929
That crow enjoys a temporary
monopoly on peanuts,

00:08:52.953 --> 00:08:56.596
until his friends figure out
how to do it, and then there we go.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.976
So, what's significant about this to me

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.334
isn't that we can train crows
to pick up peanuts.
