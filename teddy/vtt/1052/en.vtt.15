00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:31.331
you can come back anytime
and get yourself a peanut.

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:34.840
So when they get really used to that,
we move on to the crows coming back.

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:36.967
Now they're used to the sound
of the machine;

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.103
they keep coming back
and digging out peanuts

00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:40.850
from the pile of coins that's there.

00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:43.410
When they get really happy
about this, we stymie them.

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:46.228
We move to the third stage,
where we only give them a coin.

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:48.990
Now, like most of us who have gotten
used to a good thing,

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:50.353
this really pisses them off.

00:07:50.377 --> 00:07:53.657
So they do what they do in nature
when they're looking for something:

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.754
sweep things out of the way
with their beak.

00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:58.620
They do that here, and that knocks
the coins down the slot.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.430
When that happens, they get a peanut.
