00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.722
the crows fly down, reel up the lines,
and eat the fish or the bait.

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:03.684
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:05.147
On an entirely different tack,

00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:07.761
at University of Washington
a few years ago,

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:11.145
they were doing an experiment where
they captured some crows on campus.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.987
Some students went out,
netted some crows, brought them in,

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:16.595
weighed and measured them,
and let them back out again.

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.831
And they were entertained to discover
that for the rest of the week,

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:22.487
whenever these particular students
walked around campus,

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.622
these crows would caw at them
and run around,

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:26.458
and make their life kind of miserable.

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:27.484
(Laughter)

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.453
They were significantly less entertained

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.206
when this went on for the next week.
