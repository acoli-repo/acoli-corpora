00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.334
isn't that we can train crows
to pick up peanuts.

00:09:01.358 --> 00:09:05.188
Mind you, there's 216 million
dollars' worth of change lost every year,

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.867
but I'm not sure I can depend
on that ROI from crows.

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:08.938
(Laughter)

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:12.146
Instead, I think we should look
a little bit larger.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.436
I think crows can be trained
to do other things.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.936
For example, why not train them
to pick up garbage after stadium events?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.864
Or find expensive components
from discarded electronics?

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.773
Or maybe do search and rescue?

00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:25.976
The main point of all this for me is,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.729
we can find mutually beneficial
systems for these species.

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:31.257
We can find ways to interact
with these other species
