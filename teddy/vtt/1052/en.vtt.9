00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.206
when this went on for the next week.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.503
And the next month.

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.255
And after summer break.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.578
Until they finally graduated
and left campus,

00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:38.342
and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:41.605
came back sometime later, and found

that are studying these crows,
do so with a giant wig and a big mask.

00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:53.612
(Laughter)

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:54.946
It's fairly interesting.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.541
(Laughter)

00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:58.489
So we know these crows are really smart,

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:00.693
but the more I dug into this,
the more I found
