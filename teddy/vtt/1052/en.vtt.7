00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:30.922
Yeah. All right.

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:35.591
(Applause)

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.096
So that's the part where
the researchers freak out.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.889
(Laughter)

00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:41.080
It turns out,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.344
we've been finding more and more
that crows are really intelligent.

00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:47.950
Their brains are in the same proportion
as chimpanzee brains are.

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.066
There's all kinds of anecdotes

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.452
for the different kinds
of intelligence they have.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:54.976
For example, in Sweden,
crows will wait for fishermen

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.893
to drop lines through holes in the ice.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.457
And when the fishermen move off,

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.722
the crows fly down, reel up the lines,
and eat the fish or the bait.
