How many of you have seen
the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.857
Any of you get really freaked out by that?

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:07.921
You might want to leave now.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:08.976
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.003
So this is a vending machine for crows.

00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:13.520
Over the past few days,
many of you have been asking,

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:16.534
"How did you come to this?
How did you get started doing this?"

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.327
It started, as with many great ideas,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.387
or many ideas you can't
get rid of, anyway,

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:21.566
at a cocktail party.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.800
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail
party with a friend of mine.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.713
We were sitting there,
and he was complaining about the crows

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.108
that were all over his yard
and making a big mess.
