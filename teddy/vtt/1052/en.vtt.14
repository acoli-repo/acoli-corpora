This is a vending machine for crows.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:04.989
And it uses Skinnerian training
to shape their behavior over four stages.

00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:06.370
It's pretty simple.

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:09.398
Basically, what happens
is that we put this out in a field

00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:11.392
or someplace where there's lots of crows.

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:14.253
We put coins and peanuts
all around the base of the machine.

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:16.318
Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:18.276
and get used to the machine being there.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.081
Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.424
Then they see peanuts
here on the feeder tray,

00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:24.170
and hop up and help themselves.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.067
Then they leave, the machine
spits up more coins and peanuts,

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:28.861
and life is dandy if you're a crow --

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:31.331
you can come back anytime
and get yourself a peanut.
