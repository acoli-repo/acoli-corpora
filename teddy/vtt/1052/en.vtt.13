00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:30.585
that illustrates that nicely.

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:33.680
The point being, they've developed
cultural adaptation.

00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:34.949
And as we heard yesterday,

00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:38.015
that's the Pandora's box
that's getting human beings in trouble,

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.912
and we're starting to see it with them.

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.472
They're able to very quickly
and very flexibly adapt

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.224
to new challenges and new resources
in their environment,

00:06:45.248 --> 00:06:47.493
which is really useful
if you live in a city.

00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.763
So we know that there's lots of crows.

00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:53.848
We found out they're really smart
and they can teach each other.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.173
When all this became clear,

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.360
I realized the only obvious thing to do
is build a vending machine.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:06:59.537
So that's what we did.

00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:01.298
This is a vending machine for crows.
