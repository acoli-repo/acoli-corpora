00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.857
And in return, we just tried
to kill them all the time.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.976
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.573
And in doing so, we were
breeding them for parasitism.

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:38.558
We were giving them all sorts
of reasons to adapt new ways.

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:41.340
So, for example, rats
are incredibly responsive breeders.

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:44.383
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried
to get rid of them knows,

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:47.409
have become really immune
to the poisons that we're using.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:51.067
So I thought, let's build something
that's mutually beneficial;

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.071
something that we can both benefit from,

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:56.114
and find some way to make
a new relationship with these species.

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:57.780
So I built the vending machine.

00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:00.874
But the story of the vending machine
is a little more interesting
