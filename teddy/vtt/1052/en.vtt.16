00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.430
When that happens, they get a peanut.

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:01.749
This goes on for some time.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.209
The crows learn that
all they have to do is show up,

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.583
wait for the coin to come out,
put it in the slot,

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:07.758
then get their peanut.

00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.861
When they're good
and comfortable with that,

00:08:09.885 --> 00:08:13.056
we move to the final stage,
where they show up and nothing happens.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.287
This is where we see the difference
between crows and other animals.

00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.023
Squirrels, for example, would show up,
look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:22.601
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:25.463
They do this maybe half a dozen times
before they get bored,

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.464
and then they go off and play in traffic.

00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:31.136
Crows, on the other hand,
show up and they try and figure it out.
