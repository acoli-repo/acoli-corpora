00:00:01.289 --> 00:00:04.125
My father grew up in the Deep South
in the 1940s and '50s,

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.003
at a time when schools
were still segregated

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.796
and the promise of going to college

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:11.632
was less a promise
and more like a game of roulette.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.386
And so for many like him,
the only real choices they had

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:17.680
were to stay in their hometown,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.515
go into the military

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.601
or to attempt to go to college.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.148
Well, my father served 20 years,
proudly and honorably,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.858
in the United States Air Force.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.944
The barriers to college
were just too high.
