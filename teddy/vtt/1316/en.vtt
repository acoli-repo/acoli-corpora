00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a photograph

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
by the artist Michael Najjar,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it's real,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the sense that he went there to Argentina

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to take the photo.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And what he's done

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is he's actually reshaped, digitally,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
all of the contours of the mountains

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So what you see,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that precipice, that high precipice with the valley,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is the 2008 financial crisis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The photo was made

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when we were deep in the valley over there.
