My title: "Queerer than we can
suppose: the strangeness of science."

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:10.558
"Queerer than we can suppose" comes
from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:15.360
who said, "Now, my own suspicion
is that the universe is not only queerer

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:19.443
than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose.

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:22.579
I suspect that there are more things
in heaven and earth

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:27.393
than are dreamed of, or can
be dreamed of, in any philosophy."
