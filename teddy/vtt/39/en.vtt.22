00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:02.784
We put ourselves
in a vulnerable place, sometimes.

00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:06.119
But through all that vulnerability,

00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:10.483
just like in everything else
we've tried to ever get better at,

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:11.809
we see progress.

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:12.984
We see growth.

00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:15.937
We allow ourselves to get better.

00:11:17.016 --> 00:11:20.437
Why wouldn't we give ourselves that?

00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:25.471
In every other part of our lives,
we give ourselves room to grow --

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:28.026
except in this one, where it matters most.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.407
Thank you.
