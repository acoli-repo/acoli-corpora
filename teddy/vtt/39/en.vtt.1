I study the psychology of good people,

00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:36.141
and research in my field says
many of us care deeply

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:41.166
about feeling like a good person
and being seen as a good person.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:46.300
Now, your definition of "good person"
and your definition of "good person"

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:49.064
and maybe the taxi driver's
definition of "good person" --

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:51.071
we may not all have the same definition,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.920
but within whatever our definition is,

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:56.745
that moral identity
is important to many of us.

00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:02.375
Now, if somebody challenges it,
like they question us for a joke we tell,
