00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:30.546
and this is what happens in a brain

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.144
that can handle 11 million
pieces of information coming in

00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.745
with only 40 being processed consciously.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.149
That's the bounded part
of bounded rationality.

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:45.829
This work on bounded rationality

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:50.019
is what's inspired work I've done
with my collaborators

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:52.678
Max Bazerman and Mahzarin Banaji,

00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:55.348
on what we call bounded ethicality.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.774
So it's the same premise
as bounded rationality,

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:04.399
that we have a human mind
that is bounded in some sort of way
