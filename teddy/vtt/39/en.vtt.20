00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:01.966
is what if we were to just forget
about being good people,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.755
just let it go,

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:06.875
and instead, set a higher standard,

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.961
a higher standard
of being a good-ish person?

00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.114
A good-ish person
absolutely still makes mistakes.

00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:20.180
As a good-ish person,
I'm making them all the time.

00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:25.255
But as a good-ish person,
I'm trying to learn from them, own them.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.838
I expect them and I go after them.

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.466
I understand there are costs
to these mistakes.
