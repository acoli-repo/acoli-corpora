that we have a human mind
that is bounded in some sort of way

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:06.505
and relying on shortcuts,

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.354
and that those shortcuts
can sometimes lead us astray.

00:04:10.886 --> 00:04:12.411
With bounded rationality,

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:16.121
perhaps it affects the cereal
we buy in the grocery store,

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:19.228
or the product we launch in the boardroom.

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.519
With bounded ethicality, the human mind,

is making decisions,

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:28.948
and here, it's about who to hire next,

00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:30.622
or what joke to tell
