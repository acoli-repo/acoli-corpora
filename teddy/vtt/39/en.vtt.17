We perhaps are overestimating
how much our self-interest

00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:36.379
is driving our decisions,

00:08:36.403 --> 00:08:42.118
and perhaps we don't realize
how much our self-view as a good person

00:08:42.142 --> 00:08:44.666
is affecting our behavior,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.175
that in fact, we're working so hard
to protect that good person identity,

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:52.493
to keep out of that red zone,

00:08:52.517 --> 00:08:57.871
that we're not actually giving ourselves
space to learn from our mistakes

00:08:57.895 --> 00:09:00.212
and actually be better people.
