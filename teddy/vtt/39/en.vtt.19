Life, if you needed to learn accounting,

00:09:31.126 --> 00:09:32.819
you would take an accounting class,

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:35.137
or if you become a parent,

00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.668
we pick up a book and we read about it.

00:09:38.692 --> 00:09:41.319
We talk to experts,

00:09:41.343 --> 00:09:42.797
we learn from our mistakes,

00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:44.320
we update our knowledge,

00:09:44.344 --> 00:09:46.310
we just keep getting better.

00:09:46.835 --> 00:09:48.791
But when it comes to being a good person,

00:09:48.815 --> 00:09:51.307
we think it's something
we're just supposed to know,

00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.594
we're just supposed to do,

00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:55.926
without the benefit of effort or growth.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.790
So what I've been thinking about

00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:01.966
is what if we were to just forget
about being good people,
