00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:31.388
that tendency towards mistakes depends
on how close we are to that red zone.

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:35.611
So most of the time, nobody's challenging
our good person identity,

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:37.794
and so we're not thinking too much

00:07:37.818 --> 00:07:40.151
about the ethical implications
of our decisions,

00:07:40.175 --> 00:07:44.054
and our model shows
that we're then spiraling

00:07:44.078 --> 00:07:48.817
towards less and less
ethical behavior most of the time.

00:07:48.841 --> 00:07:51.689
On the other hand, somebody
might challenge our identity,

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:55.212
or, upon reflection,
we may be challenging it ourselves.

00:07:55.236 --> 00:07:59.360
So the ethical implications
of our decisions become really salient,

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:05.121
and in those cases, we spiral towards
more and more good person behavior,
