00:05:30.137 --> 00:05:34.424
And these associations
don't necessarily line up

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:36.323
with what people consciously think.

00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:39.680
They may have
very egalitarian views, in fact.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:44.619
So sometimes, that 11 million
and that 40 just don't line up.

00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:47.369
And here's another example:

00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:48.885
conflicts of interest.

00:05:49.372 --> 00:05:53.182
So we tend to underestimate
how much a small gift --

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:56.849
imagine a ballpoint pen or dinner --

00:05:56.873 --> 00:06:01.031
how much that small gift
can affect our decision making.
