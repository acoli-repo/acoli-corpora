00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:00.001
look nothing alike --

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:02.184
when I confused them for each other

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:04.873
more than once, in front of everybody.

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:10.208
These kinds of mistakes send us, send me,

00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:13.067
into red-zone defensiveness.

00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:17.321
They leave us fighting
for that good person identity.

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:22.529
But the latest work that I've been doing
on bounded ethicality with Mary Kern

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:26.125
says that we're not
only prone to mistakes --

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:31.388
that tendency towards mistakes depends
on how close we are to that red zone.
