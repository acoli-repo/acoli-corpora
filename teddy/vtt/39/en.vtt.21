00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.466
I understand there are costs
to these mistakes.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.558
When it comes to issues like ethics
and bias and diversity and inclusion,

00:10:35.582 --> 00:10:38.724
there are real costs to real people,

00:10:38.748 --> 00:10:40.063
and I accept that.

00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:44.483
As a good-ish person, in fact,

00:10:44.507 --> 00:10:47.190
I become better
at noticing my own mistakes.

00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:49.514
I don't wait for people to point them out.

00:10:49.538 --> 00:10:51.680
I practice finding them,

00:10:51.704 --> 00:10:52.980
and as a result ...

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.528
Sure, sometimes it can be embarrassing,

00:10:57.552 --> 00:10:59.414
it can be uncomfortable.

00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:02.784
We put ourselves
in a vulnerable place, sometimes.
