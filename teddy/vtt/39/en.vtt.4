00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.012
about how the human mind works

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:02.186
to explain.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.648
The brain relies on shortcuts
to do a lot of its work.

00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:08.297
That means a lot of the time,

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:11.649
your mental processes are taking place
outside of your awareness,

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.411
like in low-battery, low-power mode
in the back of your mind.

00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:20.549
That's, in fact, the premise
of bounded rationality.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.014
Bounded rationality is
the Nobel Prize-winning idea

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:26.880
that the human mind
has limited storage resources,

00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:29.000
limited processing power,

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:33.056
and as a result, it relies on shortcuts
to do a lot of its work.
