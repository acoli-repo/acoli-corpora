00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:02.375
Now, if somebody challenges it,
like they question us for a joke we tell,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.082
or maybe we say
our workforce is homogenous,

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:08.085
or a slippery business expense,

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.307
we go into red-zone defensiveness
a lot of the time.

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.422
I mean, sometimes we call out

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:18.115
all the ways in which we help
people from marginalized groups,

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.907
or we donate to charity,

00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.970
or the hours we volunteer to nonprofits.

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:27.685
We work to protect
that good person identity.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.645
It's important to many of us.
