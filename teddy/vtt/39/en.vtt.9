00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:30.622
or what joke to tell

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:32.868
or that slippery business decision.

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:38.760
So let me give you an example
of bounded ethicality at work.

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:41.570
Unconscious bias is one place

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:45.103
where we see the effects
of bounded ethicality.

00:04:45.127 --> 00:04:49.513
So unconscious bias refers
to associations we have in our mind,

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:53.827
the shortcuts your brain is using
to organize information,

00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:56.115
very likely outside of your awareness,

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.591
not necessarily lining up
with your conscious beliefs.
