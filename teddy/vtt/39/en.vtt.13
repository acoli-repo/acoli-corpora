00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:31.492
despite our best attempts,

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.633
and we explain away our mistakes
rather than learning from them.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.263
Like, for example,

00:06:39.287 --> 00:06:43.088
when I got an email
from a female student in my class

00:06:43.112 --> 00:06:45.660
saying that a reading I had assigned,

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:48.438
a reading I had been assigning for years,

00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:49.893
was sexist.

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:56.326
Or when I confused
two students in my class

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.707
of the same race --

00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:00.001
look nothing alike --
