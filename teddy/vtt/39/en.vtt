00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:05.221
So a friend of mine was riding
in a taxi to the airport the other day,

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.955
and on the way, she was chatting
with the taxi driver,

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.408
and he said to her, with total sincerity,

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:13.718
"I can tell you are a really good person."

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:15.559
And when she told me this story later,

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:18.758
she said she couldn't believe
how good it made her feel,

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:20.841
that it meant a lot to her.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.891
Now that may seem
like a strong reaction from my friend

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.119
to the words of a total stranger,

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:27.761
but she's not alone.

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.150
I'm a social scientist.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.827
I study the psychology of good people,
