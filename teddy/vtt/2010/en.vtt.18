And the way he tells it,

00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:06.233

00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:08.868
and he was told to make a dish
that looked very popular

00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:10.630
and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:13.326
And as he said --
we would never print this today --

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.097
but basically, the American man
has become very rich.

00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:20.392

but I spent all this time

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:22.709

who stole my recipe.

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:24.835

and I want my recipe back,

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:26.986
and I want everyone
to stop making chop suey,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.883
or pay me for the right to do the same.

00:09:28.907 --> 00:09:32.572
So it was an early exercise
of intellectual property rights.
