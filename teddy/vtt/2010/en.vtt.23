00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.994
They did so through a centralized
headquarters out of Illinois.

00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:35.230
Chinese restaurants have done largely
the same thing, I would argue,

00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:37.802
with the menu and the decor,
even the restaurant name,

00:11:37.826 --> 00:11:39.693
but without a centralized headquarters.

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:42.058
So, this actually became very clear to me

00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:44.841
with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,

00:11:44.865 --> 00:11:47.976
where they expected, based
on the number of ticket sales they had,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.021
to have three or four
second-place winners,

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.265
people who match
five or six Powerball numbers.

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:54.928
Instead, they had 110,
and they were completely shocked.

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:58.313
They looked all across the country
and discovered it couldn't be fraud,

00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:01.819
since it happened in different states,
across different computer systems.
