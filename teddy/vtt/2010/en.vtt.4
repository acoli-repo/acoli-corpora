00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.088
[It's a fortune!]

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.733
[Tasty!]

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.161
So where are they from?

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.786
The short answer is, actually,
they're from Japan.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:14.146
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still
small family-run bakeries

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.506
that make fortune cookies,
as they did over 100 years ago,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.680
30 years before fortune cookies
were introduced in the United States.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:23.327
If you see them side by side,

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.630
there's yellow and brown.

00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:27.344
Theirs are actually flavored
with miso and sesame paste,

00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:29.383
so they're not as sweet as our version.

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.000
So how did they get to the US?
