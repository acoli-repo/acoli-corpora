00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.000
So how did they get to the US?

00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:33.976
Well, the short answer is,
the Japanese immigrants came over,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.458
and a bunch of the bakers
introduced them --

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.458
including at least one in Los Angeles,

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:40.975
and one here in San Francisco,
called Benkyodo,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.145
which is on the corner
of Sutter and Buchanan.

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.976
Back then, they made fortune cookies
using very much the similar kind of irons

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.749
that we saw back in Kyoto.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.162
The interesting question is:

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:54.597
How do you go from fortune cookies
being something that is Japanese

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:56.344
to being something that is Chinese?

00:02:56.368 --> 00:02:59.491
Well, we locked up all the Japanese
during World War II,

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:01.584
including those that made fortune cookies.
