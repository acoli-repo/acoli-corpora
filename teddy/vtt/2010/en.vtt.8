00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.731
and says, "mòmíngqímiào,"
which means, "This is all nonsense,"

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:04.706
and goes back to play his mah-jongg

Another dish, one of my favorites:
beef with broccoli.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:11.896
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.641
in fact, it is originally
an Italian vegetable.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:17.640
It was introduced into
the United States in the 1800s,

00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:20.541
but became popularized
in the 1920s and the 1930s.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:24.014
The Chinese have their own version
of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,

00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:26.457
but they've now discovered
American broccoli,

00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:30.366
and are importing it
as a sort of exotic delicacy.
