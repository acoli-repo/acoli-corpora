This is a dish called "Magic Bowl,"
that I discovered.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.976
There's Indian Chinese food,
Korean Chinese food,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.484
Japanese Chinese food,

00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:40.477
where they take the bao, the little buns,
and make them into pizza versions.

00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:41.616
(Laughter)

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.817
And they totally randomly
take Chinese noodle dishes,

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.049
and just ramenize them.

00:10:46.073 --> 00:10:49.287
This is something that,
in the Chinese version, has no soup.

00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:51.274
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,

00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:53.753
which should not be mixed
with Mexican Chinese food,

00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:56.750
where they basically take things
and make it look like fajitas.

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:57.776
(Laughter)

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.860
And they have things
like risotto chop suey.

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:01.956
My personal favorite
of all the restaurants
