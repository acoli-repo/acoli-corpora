So me, General Tso's Chicken
and this logo are all karmicly related.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.297
But that dish also took about 10 years
to spread across America

00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:36.000
from a restaurant in New York City.

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:38.798
Someone's like, "It's sweet,
it's fried, it's chicken --

00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:40.195
Americans will love this."

00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:44.175
So what I like to say,
this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:48.342
is that we think of McDonald's as sort
of the Microsoft of dining experiences.

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:51.122
We can think of Chinese
restaurants perhaps as Linux,

00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:53.392
sort of an open-source thing, right?

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:54.418
(Laughter)

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:58.087
Where ideas from one person
can be copied and propagated

00:14:58.111 --> 00:14:59.332
across the entire system,

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:03.203
that there can be specialized
versions of Chinese food,
