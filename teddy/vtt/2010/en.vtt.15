This is actually a real
advertisement for rat poison

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:35.598
from the late 1800s.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.280
And if you see under the word
"Clears" -- very small --

00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:41.090
it says, "They must go,"
which refers not only to the rats,

00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:43.091
but to the Chinese in their midst,

00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:46.168
because the way
that the food was perceived

00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:49.264
was that these people who ate
foods different from us

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:50.542
must be different from us.

00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:53.944
Another way that you saw
this antipathy towards the Chinese

00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:55.457
is through documents like this.

00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.152
This is in the Library of Congress.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.239
It's a pamphlet published
by Samuel Gompers,

00:07:59.263 --> 00:08:01.001
hero of our American labor movement.
