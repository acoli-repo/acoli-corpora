00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:01.584
including those that made fortune cookies.

00:03:01.608 --> 00:03:03.411
So that's when the Chinese moved in,

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:05.371
saw a market opportunity and took over.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:07.021
(Laughter)

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:09.407
So, fortune cookies:
invented by the Japanese,

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.742
popularized by the Chinese,

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:12.595
but ultimately consumed by Americans.

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.579
They're more American than anything else.

00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:16.044
Another of my favorite dishes:

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.225
General Tso's Chicken --
which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.777
is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.807
(Laughter)

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:22.983
I love this dish.

00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:26.068
The original name of my book
was "The Long March of General Tso."

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:27.779
And he has marched very far indeed,

00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:30.846
because he is sweet, he is fried,
and he is chicken --
