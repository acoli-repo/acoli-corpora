00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.199
on H Street in Washington.

00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:33.483
(Laughter)

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.178
And it's not completely gratuitous,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.179
because "wok" and "roll" --
Chinese food and Japanese foods,

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:39.368
so it kind of works out.

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:41.614
And Americans love
their Chinese food so much,

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.573
they've actually brought it into space.

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:47.208
NASA, for example, serves
thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.384
on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.746
So, let me present the question to you:

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.394
If our benchmark
for Americanness is apple pie,

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:58.055
you should ask yourself:
how often do you eat apple pie,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.055
versus how often do you eat Chinese food?
