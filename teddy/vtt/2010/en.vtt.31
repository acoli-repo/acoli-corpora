00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.326
So the thing is,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.138
our historical lore,
because of the way we like narratives,

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:37.191
is full of vast characters,
such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:39.471
and Ray Kroc with McDonald's

00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:41.976
and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.123
But, you know, it's very easy
to overlook the smaller characters.

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.831
For example, Lem Sen,
who introduced chop suey,

00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:51.232
Chef Peng, who introduced
General Tso's Chicken,

00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:54.976
and all the Japanese bakers
who introduced fortune cookies.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.777
So, the point of my presentation
is to make you think twice;

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:01.239
that those whose names
are forgotten in history
