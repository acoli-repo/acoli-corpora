00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:02.622
I went across the country,
looking for these restaurants

00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:05.574
where these people had gotten
their fortune cookies from.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:09.237
There are a bunch of them,
including Lee's China in Omaha --

00:13:09.261 --> 00:13:12.042
which is actually run by Koreans,
but that's another point,

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:14.623
and a bunch of them named "China Buffet."

00:13:14.647 --> 00:13:17.976
What's interesting is that their stories
were similar, but different.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.976
It was lunch, it was take-out,
it was sit-down, it was buffet,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.257
it was three weeks ago,
it was three months ago.

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:26.401
But at some point, all these people
had a very similar experience

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:29.289
that converged at a fortune cookie
and a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:29.313 --> 00:13:31.909
And all these restaurants
were serving fortune cookies,
