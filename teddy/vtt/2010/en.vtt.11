00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.853
still the deadliest civil war
in the world to this day.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.894
So, you know, I realized when I was there,

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.895
General Tso is kind of a lot
like Colonel Sanders in America,

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.447
in that he's known
for chicken and not war.

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:43.963
But in China, this guy's actually known
for war and not chicken.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:47.128
But the granddaddy
of all the Chinese American dishes

00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:50.072
we probably ought to talk
about is chop suey,

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:53.214
which was introduced
around the turn of the 20th century.

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:55.866
According to the New York Times in 1904,

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.753
there was an outbreak
of Chinese restaurants all over town,

00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:01.696
and "... the city has gone
'chop suey' mad."
