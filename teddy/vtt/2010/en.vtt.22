My personal favorite
of all the restaurants

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.567
I've encountered around the world

00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.631
was this one in Brazil,
called "Kung Food."

00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:09.266
(Laughter)

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.539
So, let's take a step back and understand

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:15.135
what is to be appreciated in America.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:20.418
McDonald's has garnered
a lot of attention, a lot of respect,

00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:25.992
for basically standardizing the menu,
decor and dining experience

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.566
in post-World War II America.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.830
But you know what?

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.994
They did so through a centralized
headquarters out of Illinois.
