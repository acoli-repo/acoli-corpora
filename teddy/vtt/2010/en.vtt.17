00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.976
the only time in American history

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.908
when a group was specifically excluded

00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:36.343
for its national origin or ethnicity.

00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:38.760
So in a way, because
the Chinese were attacked,

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.933

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:43.976
Who came up with the idea of chop suey?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.298
There's a lot of different

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:52.039
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:54.270
shows up in Chinatown,
New York City, and says,

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:56.261
"I want you all to stop making chop suey,

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:59.815
because I am the original creator
and sole proprietor of chop suey.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.220
And the way he tells it,
