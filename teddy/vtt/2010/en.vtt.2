00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.055
versus how often do you eat Chinese food?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.471
And if you think about it,

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:12.447
a lot of the foods that we or Americans
think of as Chinese food

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.606
are barely recognizable to Chinese.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.669
For example: beef with broccoli,
egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.749
fortune cookies, chop suey,
the take-out boxes.

00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:24.921
For example, I took a whole bunch
of fortune cookies back to China,

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.373
gave them to Chinese
to see how they would react.

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:28.664
[What is this?]

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.072
[Should I try it?]
