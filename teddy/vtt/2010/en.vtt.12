00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:01.696
and "... the city has gone
'chop suey' mad."

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.413
So it took about 30 years
before the Americans realized

00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:07.976
that chop suey is actually
not known in China,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.917
and as this article points out,

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:14.528
"The average native of any city in China
knows nothing of chop suey."

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.937
Back then it was a way to show
you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.632
a guy who wanted to impress a girl
could take her on a chop suey date.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.109
I like to say chop suey
is the biggest culinary joke

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.820
one culture ever played on another,

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.963
because "chop suey,"
translated into Chinese,

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:31.103
means "jaahp-seui," which, translated
back, means "odds and ends."
