00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.200
I'm Aracelis Girmay,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.870
and this is, "For Estefani, Third
Grade, Who Made Me a Card."

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.000
Elephant on an orange line, 
underneath a yellow circle, meaning sun.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.930
Six green, vertical lines, with color
all from the top, meaning flowers.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.295
The first time I peel back the 
five squares of Scotch tape,

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:31.945
unfold the crooked-crease 
fold of art class paper.
