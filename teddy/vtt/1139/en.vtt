00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.671
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:05.983
It has generated considerable insight in physics,

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:08.083
in biology and economics,

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.900
but not that much in the humanities and in history.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.183
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible,

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:15.829
that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.348
that you cannot measure history.

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:19.875
But I don't think that's right.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.917
I want to show you a couple of examples why.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.875
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.604
that two kings separated by centuries

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.371
will speak a very different language.

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.675
That's a powerful historical force.
