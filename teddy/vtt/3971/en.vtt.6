00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.430
We all know that exploration is risky.

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:02.273
We don't know the answers,

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.368
we don't know if we're going to find them,

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.669
and we know that the risks are high.

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:08.584
Exploitation is the opposite.

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:11.685
Exploitation is taking
the knowledge we have

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.504
and making good, better.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:17.647
Exploitation is about making
our trains run on time.

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:21.972
It's about making good products
faster and cheaper.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.944
Exploitation is not risky --

00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.072
in the short term.

00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:29.401
But if we only exploit,

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.818
it's very risky in the long term.
