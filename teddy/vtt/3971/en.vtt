Here are two reasons companies fail:

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:07.167
they only do more of the same,

00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:10.659
or they only do what's new.

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:16.513
To me the real, real
solution to quality growth

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:20.102
is figuring out the balance
between two activities:

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.698
exploration and exploitation.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.704
Both are necessary,

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.441
but it can be too much of a good thing.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.386
Consider Facit.
