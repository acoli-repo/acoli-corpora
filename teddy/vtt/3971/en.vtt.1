Consider Facit.

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.465
I'm actually old enough to remember them.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.657
Facit was a fantastic company.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.472
They were born deep in the Swedish forest,

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:42.002
and they made the best
mechanical calculators in the world.

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:43.900
Everybody used them.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:48.977
And what did Facit do when
the electronic calculator came along?

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.414
They continued doing exactly the same.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:56.671
In six months, they went
from maximum revenue ...

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:57.931
and they were gone.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.800
Gone.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:03.696
To me, the irony about the Facit story
