00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:30.003
It's about search,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:31.470
it's about discovery,

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:33.056
it's about new products,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.921
it's about new innovations.

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:38.595
It's about changing our frontiers.

00:02:39.408 --> 00:02:42.843
Our heroes are people
who have done exploration:

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.208
Madame Curie,

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:45.390
Picasso,

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:46.588
Neil Armstrong,

00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:48.771
Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.545
I come from Norway;

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.353
all our heroes are explorers,
and they deserve to be.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.430
We all know that exploration is risky.
