00:06:08.731 --> 00:06:11.245
We see this in the public sector as well.

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:17.448
We all know that any kind
of effective reform of education,

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:19.899

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:23.326
takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:26.578

We really don't give them the chance.
