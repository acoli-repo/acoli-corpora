00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:30.460
with earlier generations of distribution,

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.041
but they always -- and I think
they will always --

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:35.040
keep pushing for the next battle.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.937
I see other companies that say,

00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:42.402
"I'll win the next innovation cycle,
whatever it takes."

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:46.517
Second one: think in multiple time scales.

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.256
I'll share a chart with you,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.138
and I think it's a wonderful one.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:52.174
Any company we look at,

00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:53.997
taking a one-year perspective

00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.298
and looking at the valuation
of the company,

00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:59.701
innovation typically accounts
for only about 30 percent.
