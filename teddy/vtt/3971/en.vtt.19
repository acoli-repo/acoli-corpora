I want to just point out two questions
that I think are useful.

00:09:33.397 --> 00:09:36.801
First question is,
looking at your own company:

00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:41.756
In which areas do you see
that the company is at the risk

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.024
of falling into success traps,

00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:46.579
of just going on autopilot?

00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:50.286
And what can you do to challenge?

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.242
Second question is:

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.791
When did I explore something new last,

00:09:57.815 --> 00:10:00.068
and what kind of effect did it have on me?
