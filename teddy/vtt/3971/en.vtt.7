it's very risky in the long term.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:36.261
And I think we all have memories
of the famous pop groups

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.236
who keep singing the same songs
again and again,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.325
until they become obsolete
or even pathetic.

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:46.448
That's the risk of exploitation.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.432
So if we take a long-term
perspective, we explore.

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:56.604
If we take a short-term
perspective, we exploit.

00:03:57.693 --> 00:04:00.144
Small children, they explore all day.
