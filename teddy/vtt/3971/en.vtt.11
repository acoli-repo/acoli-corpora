00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:30.348
Why is balancing so difficult?

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:33.476
I think it's difficult
because there are so many traps

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.150
that keep us where we are.

00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:38.338
So I'll talk about two,
but there are many.

00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:42.086
So let's talk about
the perpetual search trap.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:44.428
We discover something,

00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:47.307
but we don't have the patience
or the persistence

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:49.659
to get at it and make it work.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.828
So instead of staying with it,
we create something new.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.152
But the same goes for that,

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:55.927
then we're in the vicious circle

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.263
of actually coming up with ideas
but being frustrated.
