Small children, they explore all day.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.675
All day it's about exploration.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.739
As we grow older,

00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:08.641
we explore less because we have
more knowledge to exploit on.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.763
The same goes for companies.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:16.570
Companies become,
by nature, less innovative

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:18.483
as they become more competent.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.493
And this is, of course,
a big worry to CEOs.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.919
And I hear very often questions
phrased in different ways.

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:29.101
For example,

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:33.673
"How can I both effectively run
and reinvent my company?"
