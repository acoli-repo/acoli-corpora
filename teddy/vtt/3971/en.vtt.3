00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.806
Let's call them OncoSearch.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.487
The company was brilliant.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:37.129
They had applications that promised
to diagnose, even cure,

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.645
certain forms of blood cancer.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.720
Every day was about
creating something new.

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:46.248
They were extremely innovative,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.148
and the mantra was,
"When we only get it right,"

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:51.830
or even, "We want it perfect."

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:54.544
The sad thing is,

00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:56.466
before they became perfect --

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.419
even good enough --

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.037
they became obsolete.
