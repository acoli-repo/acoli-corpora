WEBVTT

00:04:54.658 --> 00:05:01.354
is only about two percent of companies
are able to effectively explore

00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:04.723
and exploit at the same time, in parallel.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.454
But when they do,

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:09.427
the payoffs are huge.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.726
So we have lots of great examples.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.466
We have Nestlé creating Nespresso,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.512
we have Lego going into animated films,

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:20.942
Toyota creating the hybrids,

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.437
Unilever pushing into sustainability --

00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:26.642
there are lots of examples,
and the benefits are huge.

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:30.348
Why is balancing so difficult?
