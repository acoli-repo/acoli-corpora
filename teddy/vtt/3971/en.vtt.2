To me, the irony about the Facit story

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.986
is hearing about the Facit engineers,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.093
who had bought cheap, small
electronic calculators in Japan

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:15.778
that they used to double-check
their calculators.

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.215
(Laughter)

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.887
Facit did too much exploitation.

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.876
But exploration can go wild, too.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.051
A few years back,

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:28.101
I worked closely alongside
a European biotech company.

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.806
Let's call them OncoSearch.
