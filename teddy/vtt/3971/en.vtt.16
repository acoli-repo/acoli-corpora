00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.574
So when we think one year,

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:03.880
innovation isn't really that important.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.058
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective
on the same company --

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:13.260
suddenly, innovation and ability
to renew account for 70 percent.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:15.730
But companies can't choose.

00:08:15.754 --> 00:08:19.660
They need to fund the journey
and lead the long term.

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:21.922
Third:

00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:23.541
invite talent.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:26.522
I don't think it's possible for any of us

00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:31.076
to be able to balance exploration
and exploitation by ourselves.
