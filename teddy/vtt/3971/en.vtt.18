00:08:54.133 --> 00:09:00.466
Maybe it's useful to think back
at the old triumph marches in Rome,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.986
when the generals, after a big victory,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.361
were given their celebration.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.489
Riding into Rome on the carriage,

00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:13.735
they always had a companion
whispering in their ear,

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.245
"Remember, you're only human."

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.677
So I hope I made the point:

00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.723
balancing exploration and exploitation

00:09:23.747 --> 00:09:25.194
has a huge payoff.

00:09:25.218 --> 00:09:27.779
But it's difficult,
and we need to be conscious.

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:32.783
I want to just point out two questions
that I think are useful.
