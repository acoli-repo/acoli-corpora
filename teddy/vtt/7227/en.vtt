00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.668
For as long as I can remember,
I've always recognized myself as a girl.

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:09.306
I hung out with all of the other girls,
I talked like the other girls,

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:13.043
and I had eyes only for makeup,
Barbies and girls' toys,

00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:16.246
all of which could be found
in the "pink aisle" at Toys 'R' Us.

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:18.982
Before my hair had grown long,

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:21.752
I would wear my favorite
red turtleneck around my head

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.754
like Ariel's long flowing hair,

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:24.955
and every Halloween,

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.357
I would tell my parents
I wanted to be a girl.

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.859
A witch one year,

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:30.561
and a princess the next year,
