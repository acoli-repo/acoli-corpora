00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Up until now, our communication with machines

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
has always been limited

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to conscious and direct forms.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Whether it's something simple

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
like turning on the lights with a switch,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or even as complex as programming robotics,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we have always had to give a command to a machine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or even a series of commands,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in order for it to do something for us.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Communication between people, on the other hand,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is far more complex and a lot more interesting

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because we take into account

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so much more than what is explicitly expressed.
