00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.071
This session is on natural wonders,

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:04.881
and the bigger conference
is on the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.528
I want to try to combine them all,

00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:09.800
because to me, healing is really
the ultimate natural wonder.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.714
Your body has a remarkable
capacity to begin healing itself,

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:16.393
and much more quickly
than people had once realized,

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:19.310
if you simply stop doing
what's causing the problem.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:23.361
And so, really, so much of what we do
in medicine and life in general

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.458
is focused on mopping up the floor
without also turning off the faucet.

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:29.206
I love doing this work,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.072
because it really gives many people
new hope and new choices
