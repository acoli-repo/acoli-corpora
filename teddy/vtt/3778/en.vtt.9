00:04:27.217 --> 00:04:33.019
So we came up with this plan
with 144 actions in different areas.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:35.366
Now I will go through
all of them one by one --

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:42.170
no, just giving some examples
of what we had done in the next few years.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.896
So the first thing, we set up a system
with the national space agency

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.903
that could actually see
where deforestation is happening,

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:52.404
almost in real time.

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:54.788
So now in Brazil, 
we have this system, DETER,

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:58.083
where every month,
or every two months,

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.867
we get information on
where deforestation is happening
