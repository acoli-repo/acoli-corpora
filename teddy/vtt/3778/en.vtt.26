00:12:56.366 --> 00:13:01.677
Deforestation means 60 percent
of the greenhouse gas emissions

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.516
in Brazil in the last decade.

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.587
Now it's a little bit
less than 30 percent.

00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:09.487
In the world, 60 percent is energy.

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:13.026
So if we can tackle directly the energy,

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:15.714
the same way we could
tackle deforestation,

00:13:15.714 --> 00:13:17.890
maybe we can have a chance.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.547
So there are five things
that I think we should do.

00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:25.893
First, we need to disconnect development
from carbon emissions.

00:13:25.893 --> 00:13:31.982
We don't need to clear-cut all the forests
to actually get more jobs
