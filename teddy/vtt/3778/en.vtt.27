00:13:25.893 --> 00:13:31.982
We don't need to clear-cut all the forests
to actually get more jobs

00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:33.795
and agriculture and have more economy.

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:36.297
That's what we proved
when we decreased deforestation

00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:38.113
and the economy continued to grow.

00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:42.510
Same thing could happen
in the energy sector.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.793
Second, we have to move
the incentives to the right place.

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:51.050
Today, 500 billion dollars a year
goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.204
Why don't we put a price on carbon
and transfer this to the renewable energy?

00:13:56.204 --> 00:13:59.638
Third, we need to measure
and make it transparent

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:02.932
where, when and who
is emitting greenhouse gases
