00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:02.412
which means that every minute,

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:05.785
an area the size of two soccer fields

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:09.665
is being cut in the Amazon
last year, just last year.

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:13.748
If we sum up the deforestation we have
in the other biomes in Brazil,

00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:17.820
we are talking about still the largest
deforestation rate in the world.

00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:22.459
It's more or less like
we are forest heroes,

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.540
but still deforestation champions.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:30.327
So we can't be satisfied,
not even close to satisfied.
