00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:32.614
That was when we shifted
from deforestation of temperate forests

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.520
to deforestation of tropical forests.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:39.439
So think of this: In 100 years,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.275
we lost the same amount
of forest in the tropics

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.916
that we lost in 2,000 years
in temperate forests.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.523
That's the speed of the destruction
that we are having.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.895
Now, Brazil is an important
piece of this puzzle.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:58.655
We have the second largest
forest in the world, just after Russia.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.341
It means 12 percent of all
the world's forests are in Brazil,
