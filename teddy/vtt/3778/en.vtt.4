00:01:56.646 --> 00:02:00.009
and just one quarter is in the tropics,

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.023
but this one quarter, one billion
hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:10.472
and very importantly, 50 percent
of the living biomass, the carbon.

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:16.229
Now, we used to have
six billion hectares of forest --

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.072
50 percent more than
what we have -- 2,000 years ago.

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:23.638
We've actually lost two billion hectares
in the last 2,000 years.

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.915
But in the last 100 years,
we lost half of that.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:32.614
That was when we shifted
from deforestation of temperate forests
