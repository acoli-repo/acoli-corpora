00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:34.256
And when we were there
we learned about this pine beetle

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:37.547
that is literally eating
the forests in Canada.

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:43.819
What we see here, those brown trees,
these are really dead trees.

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:48.384
They are standing dead trees
because of the larvae of the beetle.

00:09:48.384 --> 00:09:51.429
What happens is that this beetle

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:54.229
is controlled by
the cold weather in the winter.

00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:57.980
For many years now, they don't have
the sufficient cold weather

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.042
to actually control
the population of this beetle.
