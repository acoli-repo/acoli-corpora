00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:01.984
I will not get into that now.

00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:05.441
But in order to get
to this limit of two degrees,

00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:09.254
which is possible for us to survive,

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:14.317
the IPCC, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:11:14.317 --> 00:11:20.615
defines that we have a budget of emissions
of 1,000 billion tons of CO2

00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:24.579
from now until the end of the century.

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:27.243
So if we divide this
by the number of years,

00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:33.910
what we have is an average budget
of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.
