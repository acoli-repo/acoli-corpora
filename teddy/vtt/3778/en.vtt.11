00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:31.189
This also allows us
to make a big operation

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.914
to seize corruption and illegal activities

00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:39.187
that ended up having 700 people in prison,
including a lot of public servants.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.172
Then we made the connection
that areas that have been doing

00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:48.525
illegal deforestation should not get
any kind of credit or finance.

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:53.037
So we cut this through the bank system
and then linked this to the end users.

00:05:53.037 --> 00:05:55.442
So supermarkets,
the slaughterhouses, and so on

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.868
that buy products
from illegal clear-cut areas,

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.526
they also can be liable
for the deforestation.
