00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.042
to actually control
the population of this beetle.

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:08.284
And it became a disease
that is really killing billions of trees.

00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:12.574
So I came back with this notion
that the forest is actually

00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:17.843
one of the earliest and most affected
victims of climate change.

00:10:17.843 --> 00:10:19.503
So I was thinking,

00:10:19.503 --> 00:10:23.967
if I succeed in working
with all my colleagues

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:26.443
to actually help to stop deforestation,

00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:30.690
maybe we will lose the battle
later on for climate change
