00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.639
So at this moment -- this is 2003, 2004 --

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.116
I happened to be coming to work
in the government.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:10.566
And together with other teammates
in the National Forest Department,

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:16.293
we were assigned a task to join a team
and find out the causes of deforestation,

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:19.005
and make a plan to combat that
at a national level,

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.341
involving the local governments,
the civil society,

00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.184
business, local communities,

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:27.217
in an effort that could
tackle those causes.

00:04:27.217 --> 00:04:33.019
So we came up with this plan
with 144 actions in different areas.
