00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:02.932
where, when and who
is emitting greenhouse gases

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:07.128
so we can have actions specifically
for each one of those opportunities.

00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:11.914
Fourth, we need to leapfrog
the routes of development,

00:14:11.914 --> 00:14:14.710
which means, you don't need
to go to the landline telephone

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.044
before you get to the mobile phones.

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:19.182
Same way we don't need
to go to fossil fuels

00:14:19.182 --> 00:14:21.890
to the one billion people
who don't have access to energy

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.084
before we get to the clean energy.

00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:25.970
And fifth and last,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.668
we need to share responsibility
between governments,

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.390
business and civil society.
