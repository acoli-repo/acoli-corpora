00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.928
So in the last 10 years,

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:34.532
deforestation came down
in Brazil 75 percent.

00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:40.143
(Applause)

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:43.915
So if we compare it
with the average deforestation

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:46.177
that we had in the last decade,

00:06:46.177 --> 00:06:51.181
we saved 8.7 million hectares,
which is the size of Austria.

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.694
But more importantly,
it avoided the emission

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.579
of three billion tons
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:01.653
This is by far the largest contribution
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
