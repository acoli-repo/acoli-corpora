00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.341
It means 12 percent of all
the world's forests are in Brazil,

00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:04.153
most of that in the Amazon.

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:07.597
It's the largest piece of forest we have.
It's a very big, large area.

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.979
You can see that you could fit
many of the European countries there.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.482
We still have 80 percent
of the forest cover.

00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:16.111
That's the good news.

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.818
But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.706
So if you go with that speed,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:27.745
very soon, we will loose this powerful
pump that we have in the Amazon

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:30.010
that regulates our climate.
