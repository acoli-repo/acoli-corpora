00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:30.108
the economy grew, on average,
double from the previous decade,

00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:32.697
when deforestation was actually going up.

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.752
So it's a good lesson for us.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:37.100
Maybe this is completely disconnected,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.651
as we just learned by having
deforestation come down.

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:45.120
Now this is all good news,
and it's quite an achievement,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.448
and we obviously should be
very proud about that.

00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:51.219
But it's not even close to sufficient.

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:56.109
In fact, if you think about
the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:59.748
that was over half a million hectares,

00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:02.412
which means that every minute,
