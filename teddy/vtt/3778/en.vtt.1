00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:33.799
The indigenous people called
this species pau brasil,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:39.586
and that's the reason why this land became
"land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.356
That's the only country in the world
that has the name of a tree.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.560
So you can imagine that it's very cool
to be a forester in Brazil,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.507
among other reasons.

00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:54.393
Forest products are all around us.

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.326
Apart from all those products,

00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.219
the forest is very important
for climate regulation.
