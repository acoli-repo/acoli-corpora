the forest is very important
for climate regulation.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.453
In Brazil, almost 70 percent
of the evaporation that makes rain

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:07.894
actually comes from the forest.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:14.846
Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere
20 billion tons of water every day.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:21.456
This is more than what the Amazon River,
which is the largest river in the world,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:26.116

which is 17 billion tons.

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:31.201
If we had to boil water to get
the same effect as evapotranspiration,
