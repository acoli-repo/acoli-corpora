00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:31.201
If we had to boil water to get
the same effect as evapotranspiration,

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:36.700
we would need six months of the entire
power generation capacity of the world.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.895
So it's a hell of a service for all of us.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.595
We have in the world
about four billion hectares of forests.

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:50.232
This is more or less China, U.S.,
Canada and Brazil all together,

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:52.536
in terms of size, to have an idea.

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:56.646
Three quarters of that
is in the temperate zone,

00:01:56.646 --> 00:02:00.009
and just one quarter is in the tropics,
