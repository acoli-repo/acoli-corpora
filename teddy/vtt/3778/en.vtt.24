00:11:55.402 --> 00:12:02.467
Now the emissions today
are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:06.895
It's growing and maybe
it will be 61 by 2020.

00:12:06.895 --> 00:12:11.592
Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050.

00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:13.367
And while this happens,

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:16.514
the population will grow
from seven to nine billion people,

00:12:16.514 --> 00:12:19.412
the economy will grow
from 60 trillion dollars in 2010

00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:21.474
to 200 trillion dollars.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:25.484
And so what we need to do
is to be much more efficient

00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:30.425
in a way that we can go
from seven tons of carbon per capita
