So what a fetus is learning about in utero

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
is not Mozart's "Magic Flute"

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Will it be born into a world of abundance

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or scarcity?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Will it live a long, fruitful life

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
provide important clues to prevailing conditions
