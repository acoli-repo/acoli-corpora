00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
following their ordeal,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
researchers discovered a biological marker

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
of susceptibility to PTSD --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
an effect that was most pronounced

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in their third trimester.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
In other words,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
had passed on a vulnerability to the condition

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
to their children while they were still in utero.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Now consider this:

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,
