00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
One explanation

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
When food is scarce,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and away from other organs

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like the heart and liver.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
but the bill comes due later on in life

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
when those other organs, deprived early on,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
become more susceptible to disease.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But that may not be all that's going on.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It seems that fetuses are taking cues

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from the intrauterine environment
