WEBVTT

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
was carried out in Dijon, France

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
where researchers found

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that mothers who consumed food and drink

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
showed a preference for anise

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
on their first day of life,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and again, when they were tested later,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
on their fourth day of life.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
What this means

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers
