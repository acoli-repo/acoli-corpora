00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we might imagine that they're clean slates,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
unmarked by life,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
when in fact, they've already been shaped by us

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and by the particular world we live in.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that scientists are discovering

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
about what fetuses learn

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
while they're still in their mothers' bellies.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
First of all,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Because sounds from the outside world

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue
