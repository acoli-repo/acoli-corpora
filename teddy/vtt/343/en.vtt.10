00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
From the moment of birth,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the baby responds most to the voice

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
of the person who is most likely to care for it --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
its mother.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It even makes its cries

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
sound like the mother's language,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which may further endear the baby to the mother,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and which may give the baby a head start

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in the critical task

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of learning how to understand and speak

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
its native language.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But it's not just sounds

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that fetuses are learning about in utero.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's also tastes and smells.
