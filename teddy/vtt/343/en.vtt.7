on a pair of headphones,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and if it sucks on the other nipple,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Babies quickly show their preference

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
by choosing the first one.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Scientists also take advantage of the fact

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that babies will slow down their sucking

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
when something interests them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and resume their fast sucking

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
when they get bored.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is how researchers discovered

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that, after women repeatedly read aloud

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,
