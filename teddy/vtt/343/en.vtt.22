00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
have more obesity, more diabetes

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and more heart disease in later life

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
seems to have changed their bodies

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
in myriad ways.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
They have higher blood pressure,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
poorer cholesterol profiles

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and reduced glucose tolerance --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
a precursor of diabetes.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Why would undernutrition in the womb

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
result in disease later?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
One explanation
