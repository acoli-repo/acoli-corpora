00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and it's based on the theory

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that our health and well-being throughout our lives

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is crucially affected

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the nine months we spend in the womb.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I was myself pregnant

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
while I was doing the research for the book.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And one of the most fascinating insights

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I took from this work

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is that we're all learning about the world

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
even before we enter it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
When we hold our babies for the first time,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we might imagine that they're clean slates,
