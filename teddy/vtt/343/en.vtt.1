Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which asserts that the most important years for learning

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
are the earliest ones.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And so your answer to my question would be:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Learning begins at birth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well today I want to present to you

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
an idea that may be surprising

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and may even seem implausible,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but which is supported by the latest evidence

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from psychology and biology.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
happens before we're born,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
while we're still in the womb.
