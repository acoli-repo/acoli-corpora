00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the chemicals she's exposed to,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
even the emotions she feels --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
are shared in some fashion with her fetus.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
They make up a mix of influences

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
as individual and idiosyncratic

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
as the woman herself.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The fetus incorporates these offerings

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
into its own body,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
makes them part of its flesh and blood.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And often it does something more.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It treats these maternal contributions

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
as information,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as what I like to call biological postcards

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
from the world outside.
