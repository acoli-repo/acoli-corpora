00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from the intrauterine environment

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and tailoring their physiology accordingly.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
They're preparing themselves

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
for the kind of world they will encounter

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
on the other side of the womb.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The fetus adjusts its metabolism

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and other physiological processes

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the basis of the fetus' prediction

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is what its mother eats.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
The meals a pregnant woman consumes

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
constitute a kind of story,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a fairy tale of abundance

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
or a grim chronicle of deprivation.
