00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My subject today is learning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ready?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When does learning begin?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now as you ponder that question,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or kindergarten,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
when children are learning how to walk and talk

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and use a fork.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,
