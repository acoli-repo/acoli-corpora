00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
when fetuses are led

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to expect a world of scarcity

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and are born instead into a world of plenty.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And their higher rates of obesity,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
diabetes and heart disease

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
are the result.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of the post-war Western diet.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The world they had learned about while in utero

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
was not the same

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as the world into which they were born.
