00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And because the fetus is with her all the time,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it hears her voice a lot.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and it prefers listening to her voice

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
over anyone else's.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How can we know this?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Newborn babies can't do much,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but one thing they're really good at is sucking.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Researchers take advantage of this fact

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
by rigging up two rubber nipples,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so that if a baby sucks on one,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
it hears a recording of its mother's voice

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
on a pair of headphones,
