It's also tastes and smells.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
By seven months of gestation,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
are functioning.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
which is continuously swallowed

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
by the fetus.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
once they're out in the world.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice
