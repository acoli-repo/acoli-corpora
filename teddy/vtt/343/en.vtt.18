00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
provide important clues to prevailing conditions

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
like a finger lifted to the wind.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The resulting tuning and tweaking

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of a fetus' brain and other organs

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
are part of what give us humans

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
our enormous flexibility,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
our ability to thrive

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in a huge variety of environments,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
from the country to the city,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
from the tundra to the desert.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
about how mothers teach their children about the world

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
even before they're born.
