00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
a quarter of what they consumed before the war.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
By the beginning of May,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the nation's carefully rationed food reserve

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
was completely exhausted.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The specter of mass starvation loomed.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And then on May 5th, 1945,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the siege came to a sudden end

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
when Holland was liberated

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
by the Allies.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
killed some 10,000 people

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and weakened thousands more.
