I want to address something that you may be wondering about.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The notion of fetal learning

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
like playing Mozart through headphones

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
placed on a pregnant belly.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But actually, the nine-month-long process

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the air she breathes,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
the food and drink she consumes,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the chemicals she's exposed to,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
even the emotions she feels --
