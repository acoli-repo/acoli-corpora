00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000

My favorite experiment of this kind

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000

every day during pregnancy

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
recognized the theme song of that show

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
once they were born.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
about the particular language that's spoken
