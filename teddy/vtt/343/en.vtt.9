00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
about the particular language that's spoken

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in the world that they'll be born into.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
A study published last year

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
found that from birth, from the moment of birth,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
babies cry in the accent

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of their mother's native language.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
French babies cry on a rising note

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
while German babies end on a falling note,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
imitating the melodic contours

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of those languages.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now why would this kind of fetal learning

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
be useful?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
