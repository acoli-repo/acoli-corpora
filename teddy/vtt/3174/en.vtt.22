(Applause)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.416
It's something that I could
never have planned for.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.976

I was enthusiastic about what I was doing,

of making useless things,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.176

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.600
that you don't always know

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.496
And it turns off that voice in your head

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.976

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.336
And maybe a toothbrush helmet
isn't the answer,
