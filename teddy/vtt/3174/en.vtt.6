00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.936
the easiest way
to be at the top of your field

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.056
is to choose a very small field.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.296
(Laughter)

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.656
(Applause)

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.856
So I run a YouTube channel
about my machines,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.656
and I've done things
like cutting hair with drones --

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.376
(Drone buzzes)

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.776
(Laughter)

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.856
(Drone crashes)

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.296
(Laughter)

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.416
(Drone buzzes)

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.336
(Laughter)

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.456
(Applause)

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.216
To a machine that helps me
wake up in the morning --
