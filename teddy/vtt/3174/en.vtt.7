00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.216
To a machine that helps me
wake up in the morning --

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.176
(Alarm)

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.600
(Laughter)

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.936
(Video) Simone: Ow!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.536
To this machine
that helps me chop vegetables.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.000
(Knives chop)

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.456
I'm not an engineer.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.816
I did not study engineering in school.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.416
But I was a super ambitious
student growing up.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.936
In middle school and high school,
I had straight A's,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.176
and I graduated at the top of my year.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.456
On the flip side of that,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.176
I struggled with very severe
performance anxiety.
