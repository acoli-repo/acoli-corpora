00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.960
It's very human of them.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.496
Oh wait, let's go back a little bit,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.736
and then --

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.976
(Glass falls)

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.176
(Laughter)

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.656
Isn't it a beautiful time to be alive?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.936
(Laughter)

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.560
(Applause)

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.296
So as much as my machines can seem
like simple engineering slapstick,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.736
I realize that I stumbled
on something bigger than that.
