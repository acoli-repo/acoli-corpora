00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.776
It's googly eyes.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.896
It took me 14 hours

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.616
and 227 googly eyes to make this shirt.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.696
And being able to look at you
as much as you're looking at me

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.216
is actually only half
of the reason I made this.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.176
The other half is being able to do this.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.536
(Googly eyes rattle)

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.816
(Laughter)

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.576
So I do a lot of things like this.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.416
I see a problem and I invent
some sort of solution to it.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.256
For example, brushing your teeth.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.216
Like, it's this thing we all have to do,
it's kind of boring,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.336
and nobody really likes it.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.736
If there were any
seven-year-olds in the audience,
