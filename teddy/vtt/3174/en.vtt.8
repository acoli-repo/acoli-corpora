00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.176
I struggled with very severe
performance anxiety.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.216
Here's an email I sent
to my brother around that time.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.136
"You won't understand
how difficult it is for me to tell you,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.376
to confess this.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.776
I'm so freaking embarrassed.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.016
I don't want people
to think that I'm stupid.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.616
Now I'm starting to cry too.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.096
Damn."

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.656
And no, I did not accidentally burn
our parents' house down.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.976
The thing I'm writing about in the email
and the thing I'm so upset about

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.240
is that I got a B on a math test.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.680
So something obviously happened
between here and here.
