00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.176
I just bumped my mic off,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.120
but I think we're all good.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.656
OK, also I need to chew this popcorn,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.616
so if you guys could
just clap your hands a little bit more --

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.736
(Applause)

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.576
OK, so it's like your own
little personal solar system,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.496
because I'm a millennial,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.976
so I want everything to revolve around me.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.056
(Laughter)

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.696
Back to the glass of water,
that's what we're here for.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.776
So, I promise -- I mean, it still has --

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.376
it doesn't have any water in it,
