00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.976
And by now,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.896
this is a pretty standard
modern-day fairy tale

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.136
of girl posting on the internet,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.736
the internet takes the girl by storm,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.576
thousands of men voyage
into the comment sections

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.296
to ask for her hand in marriage --

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.336
(Laughter)

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.696
She ignores all of them,
starts a YouTube channel

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.360
and keeps on building robots.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.056
Since then, I've carved out this little
niche for myself on the internet

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.576
as an inventor of useless machines,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.256
because as we all know,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.936
the easiest way
to be at the top of your field
