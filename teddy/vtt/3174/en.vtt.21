I realize that I stumbled
on something bigger than that.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.656
It's this expression of joy and humility
that often gets lost in engineering,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.216
and for me it was a way
to learn about hardware

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040
without having my performance
anxiety get in the way.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.656
I often get asked if I think I'm ever

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.200
and maybe someday I will.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.736
But the way I see it,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.056
I already have

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.440
because I've built myself this job

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.176
and it's something that I could
never have planned for,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.416
or that I could --
