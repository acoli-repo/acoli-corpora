00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.216
And I realized that what I'd really like

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.296
is that I can look at you
as much as you're looking at me --

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.736
just to even things out a little bit.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.496
So if I had way more eyeballs,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.296
then we'd all be
really comfortable, right?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.056
So in preparation for this talk,
I made myself a shirt.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
(Rattling)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.920
(Laughter)

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.776
It's googly eyes.
