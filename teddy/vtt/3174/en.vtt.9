00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.680
So something obviously happened
between here and here.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.016
(Laughter)

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.216
One of those things was puberty.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.616
(Laughter)

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.016
Beautiful time indeed.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.376
But moreover,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.536
I got interested in building robots,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.816
and I wanted to teach myself
about hardware.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.336
But building things with hardware,
especially if you're teaching yourself,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.736
is something that's really
difficult to do.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.656
It has a high likelihood of failure

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.896
and moreover,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.696
it has a high likelihood
of making you feel stupid.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.840
And that was my biggest fear at the time.
