00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.016
but I think some sort of
"head orbit device,"

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.056
because it rotates
this platform around you

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.576
and you can put anything on it.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.416
You can have a camera;
you can get photos of your entire head.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.336
Like it's really --
it's a very versatile machine.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.056
(Laughter)

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.976
OK, and I have --

some snacks on it, for example,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.696
if you want to.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.536
I have some popcorn here.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.040
And you just put a little bit like that.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.536
And then you want to --

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.376
there's some sacrifices for science --
