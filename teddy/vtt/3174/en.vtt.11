00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280
I did not have to deal
with my performance anxiety.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.576
And as soon as I removed
all pressure and expectations from myself,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.976
that pressure quickly
got replaced by enthusiasm,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.760
and it allowed me to just play.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.136
So as an inventor,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.576
I'm interested in things
that people struggle with.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.176
It can be small things or big things
or medium-sized things

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.736
and something like giving a TED talk
presents this whole new set of problems

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.256
that I can solve.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.376
And identifying a problem
is the first step in my process

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.880
of building a useless machine.
