00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.840
And that was my biggest fear at the time.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.896
So I came up with a setup that would
guarantee success 100 percent of the time.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.296
With my setup, it would be
nearly impossible to fail.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.296
And that was that instead
of trying to succeed,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.880
I was going to try to build
things that would fail.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.616
And even though I didn't
realize it at the time,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.576
building stupid things
was actually quite smart,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.256
because as I kept on
learning about hardware,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.736
for the first time in my life,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280
I did not have to deal
with my performance anxiety.
