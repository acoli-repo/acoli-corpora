which is progestational,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.226
It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.643
It also causes some changes

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.351
to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.763
If there's no pregnancy,

00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:44.602

And I always find this point
really interesting.

Because with estrus,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.059
the final signaling to get

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:58.809
actually comes from the embryo.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.643
But with menstruation,
