00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.934
"Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?"

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:31.976
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.268
Like, what's up with that?

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.393
Why can't we talk about periods?

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:40.559
And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say,

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:41.851
because if it were,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.018
there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.976
talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.476
And it's not even about periods,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.601
because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.059
when we became menopausal,

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.768
we'd be elevated
to a higher social status.

00:01:57.792 --> 00:02:00.059
(Laughter)
