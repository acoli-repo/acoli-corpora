have volunteered
to have pressure catheters

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.768
put in their uterus

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:35.101
that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle --

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.268
God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without,

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.226
and it's very important knowledge,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.059

Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.268
during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing.

00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:54.434
(Audience gasps)

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:55.726
Right.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.893
Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery,

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.309
that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff
