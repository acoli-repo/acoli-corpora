00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.809
if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it.

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.684
We stop bleeding with pressure.

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:04.309
When we menstruate,

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:06.434
the lining of the uterus
releases substances

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:09.476
that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.726
and other inflammatory mediators.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.768
And they make the uterus cramp down,

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.851
they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.559
to stop the bleeding.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:19.774
They might also change
blood flow to the uterus

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:22.851
and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.351
And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?"

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:29.434
And from studies
where some incredible women

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:31.476
have volunteered
to have pressure catheters
