00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.643
But with menstruation,

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.268
that choice comes from the ovary.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:07.018
It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts.

00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:13.917
(Cheering and applause)

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:18.184
OK, so now we know why the blood is there.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:19.976
And it's a pretty significant amount.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.018
It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood,

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.601
which is one to three ounces,

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.893
and it can be more,

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:28.018
and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times.

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:29.309
I know.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.226
So why do we have so much blood?
