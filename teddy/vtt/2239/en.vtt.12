00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:00.809
There is maternal mortality,

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:02.476
there is the toll of breastfeeding

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.559
and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:07.851
And evolution --

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.893
(Laughter)

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:13.143
That goes on longer
for some of us than others.

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:15.643
(Laughter)

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:19.101
But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:23.726
And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.559
And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome?

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:28.768
You try to get the highest
quality embryos.

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.018
And how do you get
the highest quality embryos?
