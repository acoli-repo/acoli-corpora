It's also possible that you could have

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.726
another reason for painful periods.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.434
You could have a condition
called endometriosis,

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:09.518
where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity,

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:13.101
causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions.

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:16.518
And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet,

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:19.726
because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.434
due to very complex biological mechanisms.

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:25.643
But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.768
It shouldn't be an act of feminism

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:30.934
to know how your body works.
