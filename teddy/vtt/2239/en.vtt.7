(Laughter)

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:33.976
I mention that it affects
28 percent of women.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.684
And every single time,
someone approaches me and says,

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.851
"I thought I was the only one."

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.518
That's how effective
that culture of shame is,

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:47.309
that women can't even share
their experiences.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.768
So I began to think,

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.143
"Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist?

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:53.851
Wouldn't that be great?"

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.601
Then you would all know what I know,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:56.976
you'd know that menstruation

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.476
is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.476
Most mammals have estrus.
