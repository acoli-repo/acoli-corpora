00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.476
Most mammals have estrus.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.309
Humans, some primates,

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:05.601
some bats,

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:08.851
the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:12.351
And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:14.476
to start producing an egg.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.768
Estrogen is released

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:18.226
and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.393
cell upon cell, like bricks.

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:23.601
And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar?

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:24.893
Well, it's unstable.

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.518
So what happens when you ovulate?

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.684
You release a hormone called progesterone,

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.976
which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready.
