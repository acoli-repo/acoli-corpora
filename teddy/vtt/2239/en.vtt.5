00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:31.476
And medicine wasn't any help.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.143
In the 1920s and '30s

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:37.684
there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin.

00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:40.268
We could wilt flowers just by walking by.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:41.393
(Laughter)

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:44.143
And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:46.684
Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go,

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.167
"Well, actually, that doesn't happen."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.976
And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.018
how do you break these myths?

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.059
Because you don't even need to be a doctor

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.976
to say that periods aren't toxic.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.708
If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill?
