00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.101
I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid."

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:36.351
Why was menstruation so different?

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.351
I wanted answers to these questions

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:40.143
but there was no one for me to ask.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.351
My mother knew nothing about menstruation

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:46.059
except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.934
I asked girlfriends

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.643
and everybody spoke in euphemisms.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.893
And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:55.768
and talk about my heavy periods,

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:57.893
I was told to eat liver.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.226
(Laughter)
