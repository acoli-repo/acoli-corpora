00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:32.559
So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal,"

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:35.518
because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss.

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:39.018
As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it.

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:43.518
And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain.

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:45.643
One way is with something
called a TENS unit,

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:47.476
which you can wear under your clothes

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.601
and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:52.434
and no one really knows how it works,

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:54.976
but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.559
which is counterirritation.

00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.351
It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it.
