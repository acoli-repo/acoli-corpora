00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.309
that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:03.619
is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning,

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:05.018
but it's still pretty tight,

00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:06.393
and you wish it would stop.

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.559
So that kind of makes it different, right?

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:12.476
If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.101
we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:17.934
because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing,

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.309
we wouldn't call them weak.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.101
We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right?

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.143
(Laughter)

00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:25.601
And we wouldn't deny pain control

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:29.101
to women who have
typical pain of labor, right?

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:32.559
So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal,"
