00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now when we think of our senses,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we don't usually think of the reasons

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
why they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't really think of the evolutionary need

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to be protected by our senses,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but that's probably why our senses really evolved --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to keep us safe, to allow us to live.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Really when we think of our senses,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or when we think of the loss of the sense,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we really think about something more like this:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to smell something fragrant,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to see something beautiful.
