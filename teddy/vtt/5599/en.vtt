00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.426
Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown,

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:15.696
where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty.

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:17.926
And nothing is more uncertain–

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:21.286
or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox.

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:22.376
Throughout history,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:26.086
paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know,

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:30.696
and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world.
