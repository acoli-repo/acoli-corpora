00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.665
So, when I was in art school,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:04.084
I developed a shake in my hand,

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:07.116
and this was the straightest line I could draw.

00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:09.767
Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.956
like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.654
but at the time this was really doomsday.

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:19.271
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.641
The shake developed out of, really,

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.548
a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:26.102
just years of making tiny, tiny dots.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:29.996
And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.684
to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.
