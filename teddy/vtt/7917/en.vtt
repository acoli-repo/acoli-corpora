00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.883
If someone teleported from sea level
to the top of Mt. Everest,

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:14.343
things would go bad fast.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.181
At an altitude of 8,848 meters,

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:23.352
barometric pressure is approximately
33% of what it is at sea level.

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:27.648
This means there's significantly
less oxygen in the air,

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:31.986
and our teleported individual would
likely suffocate in minutes.
