00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.023
Imagine you're asked
to invent something new.

00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:12.694
It could be whatever you want

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.634
made from anything you choose

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:17.455
in any shape or size.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.315
That kind of creative freedom
sounds so liberating, doesn't it?

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.007
Or does it?

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.110
If you're like most people,
you'd probably be paralyzed by this task.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.395
Without more guidance,
where would you even begin?
