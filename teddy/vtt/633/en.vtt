00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the challenge of dealing with data,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
data that we have to deal with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in medical situations.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's really a huge challenge for us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And this is our beast of burden --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this is a Computer Tomography machine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a CT machine.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a fantastic device.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It uses X-rays, X-ray beams,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that are rotating very fast around the human body.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and is generating enormous amounts of information

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that comes out of the machine.
