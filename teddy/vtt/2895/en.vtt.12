00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.856
"Yes, they are, and how do you know?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.080
You can't see."

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.840
But I know what
a straight line looks like.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.536
I had snapped a picture
during our back and forth

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.800
and presented him the evidence
that proved I was right.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.080
He looked at the picture.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.160
I leaned in further.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.080
"Who's disabled now?"

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.840
Tip five: pursue audacious goals.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.936
Flip expectation upside down

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.080
and shove limitation off a cliff
to meet its demise.
