00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.080
and shove limitation off a cliff
to meet its demise.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.936
There is a college football linebacker

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.216
who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.600
while having one hand.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.616
There is a teacher
who successfully transfers knowledge

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.840
and inspires countless students

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.360
while living with Down syndrome.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.480
And for me,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.136
on my long list,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.016
to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal,
to Darjeeling, India

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.400
on the backseat
of a bicycle built for two.
