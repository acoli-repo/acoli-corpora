This one is best reserved --
very important note --

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.216
this one is best reserved
for people you know well,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.800
because random strangers
typically don't appreciate

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.920
teachable moments.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.496
A few years ago, my parents and I
went to see the Rockettes,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400
Radio City's high-kicking dancers.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.600
I leaned over to my dad.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.440
"The two Rockettes on the left
aren't kicking in a straight line."

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.000
"Yes, they are."

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.000
"No, they're not."
