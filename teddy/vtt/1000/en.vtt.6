00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.751
While all the brothers were busy
just being hyper-connected 24/7,

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:05.112
maybe a sister would have
noticed the iceberg,

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:06.675
because she would have woken up

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.580
from a seven-and-a-half-
or eight-hour sleep,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.415
and have been able to see the big picture.

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:17.815
So as we are facing
all the multiple crises

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.244
in our world at the moment,

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:23.085
what is good for us on a personal level,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.646
what's going to bring more joy,
gratitude, effectiveness in our lives

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.150
and be the best for our own careers,
