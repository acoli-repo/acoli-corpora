Especially here in Washington,
if you try to make a breakfast date,

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:04.346
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.333
they're likely to tell you,
"Eight o'clock is too late for me,

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:09.422
but that's OK, I can get
a game of tennis in

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.957
and do a few conference calls
and meet you at eight."

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:16.804
And they think that means they are
so incredibly busy and productive,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:18.475
but the truth is, they're not,

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.976
because we, at the moment,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.861
have had brilliant leaders
in business, in finance, in politics,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.706
making terrible decisions.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:34.227
So a high IQ does not mean
that you're a good leader,
