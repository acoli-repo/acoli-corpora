I fainted from exhaustion.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:40.864
I hit my head on my desk.

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:44.588
I broke my cheekbone,
I got five stitches on my right eye.

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:49.469
And I began the journey
of rediscovering the value of sleep.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.867

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.469
I met with medical doctors, scientists,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:58.372
and I'm here to tell you

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:03.932
that the way to a more productive,
more inspired, more joyful life
