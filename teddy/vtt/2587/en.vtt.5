00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.896
That is the moment I love

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.360
and that is the moment
I love to share with others.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.416
So at this point, my curiosity grew.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.216
It went from the fire hydrants
and the stop sign poles

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.193
to what else can I do with this material.

00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:46.216
Can I do something big
and large-scale and insurmountable?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
So that's when the bus happened.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.256
This was a real game changer for me.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.096
I'll always have a soft spot
in my heart for this one.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.296
At this point, people
were recognizing my work

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.816
but there wasn't much out there

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.216
that was wrapped in knitting
that was large-scale,
