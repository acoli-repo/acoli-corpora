and not taking away its identity
or its functionality

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.896
but just giving it a well-tailored
suit out of knitting.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.656
And this was fun for me.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.936
It was really fun
to take inanimate objects

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.336

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.896
why were other people
reacting so strongly to it.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.200
And I realized something.
