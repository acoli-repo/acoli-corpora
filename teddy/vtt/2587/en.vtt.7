00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.200
this is a lot of my recent work --

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.376
so was yarn bombing.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.856
Yarn bombing was also growing.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.216
And that experience showed me
the hidden power of this craft

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.976
and showed me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.880
that there was this common language
I had with the rest of the world.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.616
It was through this granny hobby --

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.776
this unassuming hobby --

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.696
that I found commonality with people

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.280
that I never thought
I'd have a connection with.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.896
So as I tell my story today,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.376
I'd also like to convey to you
