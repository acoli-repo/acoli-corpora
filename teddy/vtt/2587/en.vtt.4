We all live in this
fast-paced, digital world,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.280
but we still crave and desire
something that's relatable.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.416
I think we've all become desensitized

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.016
by our overdeveloped
cities that we live in,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.816
and billboards and advertisements,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.456
and giant parking lots,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.336
and we don't even complain
about that stuff anymore.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.616
So when you stumble upon

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.976
a stop sign pole
that's wrapped in knitting

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.696
and it seems so out of place

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.576
and then gradually -- weirdly --

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.416
you find a connection to it,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.656
that is the moment.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.896
That is the moment I love
