00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.960
on the cold, steel, gray facade
that I looked at everyday.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.759
So I wrapped the door handle.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.160
I call this the Alpha Piece.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.440
Little did I know that this tiny piece
would change the course of my life.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.976
So clearly the reaction was interesting.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.524
It intrigued me and I thought,
"What else could I do?"

00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:48.736
Could I do something in the public domain
that would get the same reaction?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.320
So I wrapped the stop sign
pole near my house.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.296
The reaction was wild.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.376
People would park their cars

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.776
and get out of their cars and stare at it,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.736
and scratch their heads and stare at it,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.256
and take pictures of it
and take pictures next to it,
