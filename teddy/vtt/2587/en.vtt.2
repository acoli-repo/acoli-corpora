00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.256
and take pictures of it
and take pictures next to it,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.256
and all of that was really exciting to me

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.296
and I wanted to do every stop sign pole
in the neighborhood.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920
And the more that I did,
the stronger the reaction.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.296
So at this point I'm smitten.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.576
I'm hooked.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.856
This was all seductive.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.616
I found my new passion

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.760
and the urban environment
was my playground.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.360
So this is some of my early work.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.056
I was very curious about this idea
of enhancing the ordinary,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.816
the mundane, even the ugly,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.496
and not taking away its identity
or its functionality
