A lot of people think
that I am a master knitter

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.416
but I actually couldn't knit
a sweater to save my life.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.576
But I did something
interesting with knitting

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.416
that had never been done before.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.896
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.336
in the sense that I wasn't
formally trained to do this --

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.976
I'm a math major actually.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.856
So I didn't think
this was in the cards for me,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.816
but I also know that I didn't
stumble upon this.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.296
And when this happened to me,
I held on tight,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.240
I fought for it and I'm proud to say
that I am a working artist today.
