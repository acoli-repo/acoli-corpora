00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.056
I'm a textile artist

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.056
most widely known for starting
the yarn bombing movement.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.016
Yarn bombing is when you take
knitted or crocheted material

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.376
out into the urban environment,
graffiti-style --

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.616
or, more specifically,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.936
without permission and unsanctioned.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.816
But when I started this over 10 years ago,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.376
I didn't have a word for it,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.536
I didn't have any
ambitious notions about it,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.096
I had no visions of grandeur.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.496
All I wanted to see was something
warm and fuzzy and human-like

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.960
on the cold, steel, gray facade
that I looked at everyday.
