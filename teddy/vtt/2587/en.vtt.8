00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.376
I'd also like to convey to you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.816
that hidden power can be found
in the most unassuming places,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.080
and we all possess skills
that are just waiting to be discovered.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.776
If you think about our hands,
these tools that are connected to us,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.176
and what they're capable of doing --

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.856
building houses and furniture,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.456
and painting giant murals --

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.136
and most of the time
we hold a controller or a cell phone.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.736
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.056
But if you think about it,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.296
what would happen
if you put those things down?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.280
What would you make?
What would you create with your own hands?
