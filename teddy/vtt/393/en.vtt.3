00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.750
Fast-forward to approximately
300,000 years to where we see the origins

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:33.360
of the first modern humans.

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:37.061
While the fossil record
between these time frames in Africa

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.253
is relatively sparse,

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:42.780
the fossils nonetheless
demonstrated certain trends

00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:45.780
from our earliest ancestors
to modern humans.

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:49.267
For example, our brains
were becoming larger

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.821
relative the rest of our body.

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:54.137
Our pelves were becoming more bowl-shaped,

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.197
and our hand-wrist morphology, or form,

00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:01.576
suggested a change in our grip
as we began to make and use stone tools
