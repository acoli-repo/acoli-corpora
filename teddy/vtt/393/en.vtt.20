00:09:57.572 --> 00:10:00.101
in identifying a species as a tool user.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:02.316
The idea is that you need
to have a large brain

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.029
to have even the capacity
to make stone tools.

00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.832
But that notion has been questioned.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.763
Furthermore, Homo naledi,
even with its small brain size,

00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:13.940
has a hand-wrist morphology
similar to other species

00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:16.588
that did make and use stone tools,

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:18.454
suggesting it had the capability.

00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:23.921
With two species coexisting
in Africa at 300,000 years,

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:26.520
we can no longer assume
we know the maker of tools

00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:29.922
at sites with no associated species.
