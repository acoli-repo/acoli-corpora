00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.796
So where does Homo naledi fit
in our human evolutionary lineage?

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.328
Who is it most closely related to?

00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:38.753
Who did it evolve from?

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:41.269
We're still trying to figure all that out.

00:10:41.778 --> 00:10:44.313
It's ironic, because
paleoanthropologists are renowned

00:10:44.337 --> 00:10:46.337
for having small sample sizes.

00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:48.314
We now have a large sample size,

00:10:48.338 --> 00:10:50.066
and more questions than answers.

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:52.596
Homo naledi has taught us,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.306
has brought us a little bit closer

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.361
to better understanding
our evolutionary past.

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:02.305
So while Mrs. Ples will always hold
a special place in my heart,
