00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.133
Let's take a step back
and put that into context.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.980
The last common ancestors
between humans and chimps

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.635
date somewhere between six
and eight million years.

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.996
The earliest hominins,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.961
or earliest human ancestors,

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:48.700
evolved into a group
known as the australopithecines.

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:53.187
The australopithecines
evolved into the genus Homo

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:56.010
and eventually modern humans -- us.

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:59.496
With each new fossil discovery,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.509
we get a little bit closer
to better understanding who we are
