00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.317
where the third molar is the biggest
and the first molar is the smallest.

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:05.262
The anterior teeth,

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:07.387
or the incisors and canines,

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:10.284
are small for the genus Homo,

00:06:10.308 --> 00:06:13.447
and the lower canine
has a cuspulid on it --

00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:17.527
an extra cuspule that gives it
a distinct mitten-like shape

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:22.432
that it shares with some specimens
of the early human, Homo erectus.

00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.970
The overall shape of the teeth
looked odd to me,

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.520
so I performed crown-shape analysis

00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:34.091
on the occlusal surfaces
of deciduous teeth, or baby teeth --
