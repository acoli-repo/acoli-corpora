00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.115
And if we had only recovered the skull,
we might have called it one thing;

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.542
if we had only recovered the pelvis,
we might have called it another.

00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:39.269
The anatomy of the skeletons
didn't make sense

00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:42.697
with the framework of what we thought
we knew of human evolution.

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:45.497
Did it belong in the genus Homo?

00:04:46.108 --> 00:04:48.017
Should it be an australopithecine?

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.516
Those bipedal, more apelike ancestors?

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:53.099
Or perhaps it should be its own species.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.058
Ultimately, after much deliberation,

00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:01.200
we decided the Rising Star specimens
did indeed warrant a new species,
