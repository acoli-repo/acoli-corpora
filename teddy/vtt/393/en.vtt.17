00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:30.785
What does all this mean?

00:08:32.097 --> 00:08:33.467
Homo naledi has taught us

00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.806
that we need to reassess
what it means to be in the genus Homo.

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.394
We need to rethink
what it means to be human.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:44.230
In fact, most of the characteristics
that we use to define the genus Homo,

00:08:44.254 --> 00:08:46.903
such as brain size and hip morphology,

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.343
are no longer valid.

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:53.818
No other species exists with this mix
of primitive and derived traits.

00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:58.249
Why is there so much morphological
variation in the genus Homo?

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:00.516
And what force is driving that variation?
