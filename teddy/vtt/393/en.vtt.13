00:06:29.544 --> 00:06:34.091
on the occlusal surfaces
of deciduous teeth, or baby teeth --

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:35.530
on your left --

00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:38.316
and the permanent premolars
and molars on your right.

00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:42.982
The deciduous teeth are especially narrow,

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:46.418
and the premolars are unique
in their outline shape

00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:47.944
compared to other hominids.

00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:51.031
In fact, when I compare the outlines,

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:52.943
when I lay them on top of each other,

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.589
they look very similar.

00:06:55.203 --> 00:06:58.088
We say they have
"low intraspecific variations,"

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.371
so the variation
within the species is low.
