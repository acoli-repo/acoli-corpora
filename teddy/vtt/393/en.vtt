00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:02.601
Human origins.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:04.375
Who are we?

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.325
Where do we come from,

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:07.560
and how do we know?

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:10.936
In my field, paleoanthropology,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.732
we explore human origins --

00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:14.819
the "who" and "where" questions --

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:18.602
by analyzing fossils that date back
thousands and even millions of years.

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:25.681
In 2015, a team of colleagues and I
named a new species in the genus Homo --

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:27.305
our genus --

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.479
Homo naledi.
