00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.509
we get a little bit closer
to better understanding who we are

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.832
and where we came from.

00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:07.665
With these new fossil finds,

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.344
we realize we now have to make
changes to this tree.

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:14.505
Until this discovery,

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:18.295
we thought we had a pretty good idea
about the patterns of evolutionary change.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.153
Current fossil evidence suggests

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:24.928
that the earliest populations
of the genus Homo evolved in Africa

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.182
somewhere between two
and three million years.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.750
Fast-forward to approximately
300,000 years to where we see the origins
