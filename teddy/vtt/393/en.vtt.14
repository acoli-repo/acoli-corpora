00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.371
so the variation
within the species is low.

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:03.322
When I compare this to groups
like the australopithecines,

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:06.108
the intraspecific variation
is much larger.

00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:10.407
Postcranially, the team concluded

00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.821
that the position of the shoulders
suggesting naledi was a climber;

00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:18.785
the flared pelvis and curved fingers
are all primitive for the genus Homo.

00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:21.015
On the other hand,

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.450
the humanlike wrist,
long slender legs and modern feet

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:28.042
are all consistent
with other members of the genus.
