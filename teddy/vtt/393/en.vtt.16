00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:02.648
With its small brain and flared pelvis,

00:08:02.672 --> 00:08:04.197
we would not have been surprised

00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.758
if the fossils turned out to be
two million years old.

00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:09.448
Instead, the fossils dated

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:14.278
to 235 to 336 thousand years,

00:08:14.302 --> 00:08:17.180
an incredibly young date
for such a small-brained individual.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:19.652
So think back to what I said earlier:

00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:23.540
we thought that our brains were becoming
larger relative to the rest of our body.

00:08:23.564 --> 00:08:28.051
Now we have a small-brained,
young individual complicating this idea.

00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:30.785
What does all this mean?
