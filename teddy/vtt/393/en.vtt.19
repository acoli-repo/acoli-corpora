00:09:26.906 --> 00:09:30.315
Another implication
that these fossils have

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:33.357
is for the archaeologists
studying stone tools in South Africa.

00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:37.180
Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi
nor the Lesedi Chambers

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:39.073
have any artifacts in them.

00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:43.995
However, they do overlap in time
with several stone-tool industries,

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:47.912
the makers of which are considered
to be either modern humans

00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:49.673
or direct human ancestors.

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:52.237
This begs the question:

00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.370
Who made the stone tools of South Africa?

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:57.548
Brain size has historically
played a key role

00:09:57.572 --> 00:10:00.101
in identifying a species as a tool user.
