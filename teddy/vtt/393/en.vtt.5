The skull of a 2.1-million-year-old
early human ancestor.

00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:34.719
From that point on,

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:37.854
I was determined to go to South Africa
and study human evolution.

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.799
I first traveled there in 2003,

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:43.347
and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.511
(Laughter)

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.536
But words can hardly convey my excitement

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.958
when I was chosen
as an early career scientist

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:52.269
by Lee Berger,

00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:54.720
a world-renowned paleoanthropologist,

00:02:54.744 --> 00:03:00.545
to be one of the primary analysts
of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
