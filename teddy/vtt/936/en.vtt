00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you remember the story

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of Odysseus and the Sirens

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
from high school or junior high school?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
after the Trojan War.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And he's standing on the deck of his ship,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
he's talking to his first mate,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he's saying,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and on those rocks sit some beautiful women

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
called Sirens.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And these women sing an enchanting song,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a song so alluring

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that all sailors who hear it
