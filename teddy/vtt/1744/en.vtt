00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a researcher, every once in a while

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you encounter something

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a little disconcerting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and teaches you that you're very wrong

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about something that you really believed firmly in.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And these are unfortunate moments,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because you go to sleep that night

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
dumber than when you woke up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, that's really the goal of my talk,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is to A, communicate that moment to you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and B, have you leave this session

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a little dumber than when you entered.
