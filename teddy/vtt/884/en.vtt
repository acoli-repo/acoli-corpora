00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:05.976
Imagine a big explosion
as you climb through 3,000 ft.

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.739
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.390
Imagine an engine
going clack, clack, clack.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:15.723
It sounds scary.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.083
Well, I had a unique seat that day.

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:19.826
I was sitting in 1D.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.659
I was the only one who could talk
to the flight attendants.

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:24.733
So I looked at them right away,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.735
and they said, "No problem.
We probably hit some birds."

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.931
The pilot had already
turned the plane around,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:31.225
and we weren't that far.
