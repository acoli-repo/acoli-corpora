Almost more important than the button
is the buttonhole.

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:03.360
And the way you figure that out is:

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:06.074
the diameter of the button
plus the width of the button,

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:07.428
plus a little bit of ease.

00:01:07.452 --> 00:01:10.500
Before buttons, clothes were bigger --

00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:12.398
they were more kind of amorphous,

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.199
and people, like, wriggled into them

00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:16.513
or just kind of wrapped
themselves in things.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:20.266
But then fashion moved closer to the body

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.521
as we discovered uses for the button.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:28.990
At one time, it was the one way
to make clothes fit against the body.

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:32.689
I think the reason buttons have endured
for so long, historically,
