I think the reason buttons have endured
for so long, historically,

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:35.701
is because they actually work
to keep our clothes shut.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:36.877
Zippers break;

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.790
Velcro makes a lot of noise,
and it wears out after a while.

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.655
If a button falls off,
you just literally sew that thing on.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.171
A button is kind of there
for the long run.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:48.529
It's not just the most
elemental design ever,

00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:52.629
it's also such a crazy fashion statement.

00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:56.018
When I was a kid, my mom knit me
this beautiful sweater.

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:57.194
I didn't like it.

00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:58.760
And then I found these buttons,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.578
and the minute the buttons were
on the sweater, I loved it.
