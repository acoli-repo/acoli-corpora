The button and the buttonhole
is such a great invention.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.230
Not only does it slip
through the buttonhole,

00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:36.099
but then it kind of falls into place,

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:39.186
and so you're completely secure,
like it's never going to open.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.035
The design of a button hasn't changed much
since the Middle Ages.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.347
It's one of the most enduring
designs in history.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.592
For me, the best buttons
are usually round.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.995
There's either a dome button
with a little shank,

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.553
or there's just this sort of round thing
with either a rim or not a rim,

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:58.441
either two holes or four holes.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:01.174
Almost more important than the button
is the buttonhole.
