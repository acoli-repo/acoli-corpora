There are no bad buttons,
there are only bad people.

00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:03.577
How does that sound? OK?

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.796
[Small thing.]

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:06.060
[Big idea.]

[Isaac Mizrahi on
the Button]

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.383
No one knows who invented the button.

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:16.841
It might have shown up
as early as 2000 BCE.

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:19.148
It was decorative when it first started,

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:21.396
just something pretty
sewn onto your clothes.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.659
Then about 3,000 years later,

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:26.414
someone finally invented the buttonhole,

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:28.265
and buttons were suddenly useful.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.040
The button and the buttonhole
is such a great invention.
