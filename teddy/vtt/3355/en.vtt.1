00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:33.832
The other 90 percent
take refuge in silence --

00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:40.714
half of them, because the incident
involves a close family member

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:43.149
or someone they know,

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:47.956
and that makes it much more difficult
to deal with and talk about.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.669
The other half don't talk about it

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.689
because they fear they won’t be believed.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.217
And they're right -- because we don't.
