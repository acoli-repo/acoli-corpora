00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
for high school players who were playing with him.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So the team that was the poorest

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
had gotten even poorer.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
There was no way they could win.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
there was about a minute left --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and despair just settled over the room.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I should have gotten it so they could have won.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
They shouldn't be failing like this.
