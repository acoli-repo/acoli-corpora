00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
actually there's a negotiation period with all teams,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and each team takes a turn,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
then we go back in negotiation, around and around,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
so each turn around is one game day.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So a few game days later it came to light

and understand what was going to happen

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and made a philosophical decision

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to attack in a peace game.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
