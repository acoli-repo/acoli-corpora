He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He proposed the film to me,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --
