00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
when I see the film --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I have a gesture she does, like this --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I am one of her teaching gestures.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And the beautiful thing was,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And so that gesture of my mother's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
continues through many generations.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It's an amazing feeling

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to have that lineage.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm not here alone.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
There are many people on this stage right now.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.
