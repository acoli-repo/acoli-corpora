00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and territorial air spaces and air forces,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
even an undersea level

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with submarines and undersea mining.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There are four countries around the board.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
They have different assets, commercial and military.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And each country has a cabinet.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and a CFO, or Comptroller.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I offer them the job, they can turn it down,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and then they choose their own cabinet.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.
