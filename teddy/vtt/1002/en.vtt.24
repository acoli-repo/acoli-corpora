00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and a dedication to an ideal

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that I simply don't have to do

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
control every conversation and response in the classroom.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is much greater than mine,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and I admit it to them openly.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of some magical things that have happened.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
In this game we had a little girl,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.
