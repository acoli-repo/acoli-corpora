00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I got a degree

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and it turned out to be education.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was an experimental education program.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and so that's what I had to go for.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I went in for a job interview

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
kept my long beard and my afro

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.
