00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions;

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we have chemical and nuclear spills,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
nuclear proliferation.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's oil spills, environmental disasters,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
water rights disputes, breakaway republics,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
famine, endangered species and global warming.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If Al Gore is here,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
because they solved global warming in a week.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
(Laughter)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Applause)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And they've done it several times too.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)
