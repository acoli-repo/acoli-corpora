00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
let's ask -- there's a parent over there."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It'll be more realer if she reads it."

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
She read two sentences.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
By the third sentence, she was in tears.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I was in tears.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Everybody understood

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We all lose.
