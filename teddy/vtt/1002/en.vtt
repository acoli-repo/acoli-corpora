00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm very fortunate to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I feel so fortunate.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I called my wife Leslie,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I said, "You know, there's so many good people

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
trying to do so much good.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a true feeling.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm a public school teacher,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Her name is Pam Moran
