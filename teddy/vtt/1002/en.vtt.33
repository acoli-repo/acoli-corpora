We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
with the real truth of what's going on.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So I'll just share a third story.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This is about my friend Brennan.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We had played the game one session after school

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
for many weeks, about seven weeks,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and every country's asset value

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
has to be increased above its starting point.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.
