00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we didn't have that term in 1978 --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but something interactive.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And so we made the game,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and it has since evolved

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Plexiglass structure.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And it has four Plexiglass layers.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There's an outer space layer

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with black holes and satellites

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and research satellites and asteroid mining.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
There's an air and space level

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and territorial air spaces and air forces,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --
