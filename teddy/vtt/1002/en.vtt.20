00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and they handle that and use that

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to understand how to, not follow --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
at first they do --

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the paths to power and destruction,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the path to war.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and impulsive thinking,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to think in a long-term, more consequential way.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with a CoEvolution Quarterly article

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
on a peace force.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm just a clock watcher.
