And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and it reminds me of him.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."

The project I'm going to tell you about

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is called the World Peace Game,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and essentially it is also an empty space.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I'd like to think of it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was a young man,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I had been dropping in and out of college.
