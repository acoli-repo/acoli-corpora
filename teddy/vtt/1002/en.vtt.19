00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I also have in the game a saboteur --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
some child -- it's basically a troublemaker --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and I have my troublemaker put to use

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
because they, on the surface,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
are trying to save the world and their position in the game.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And they do it secretly through misinformation

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and ambiguities and irrelevancies,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The saboteur is there,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --
