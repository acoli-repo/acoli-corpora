out of their own understanding.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So this happened in 1978,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and I was teaching many years later,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
His name is Chris Farina.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Applause)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.
