00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I had been dropping in and out of college.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And my parents were very patient,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
on a mystical quest.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I remember the last time I came back from India --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in my long white flowing robes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and I said to my father,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)
