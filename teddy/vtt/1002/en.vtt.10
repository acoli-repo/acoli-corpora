00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I saw myself literally disappear.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
What I saw

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was my teachers coming through me.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
wry smile under his handlebar mustache.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And they weren't flashing in anger,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.
