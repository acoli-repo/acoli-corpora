they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You know the one.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
because I've got eyes in the back of my head."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Laughter)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You know that teacher?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I didn't use that stare very often,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
but I do have it in my repertoire.
