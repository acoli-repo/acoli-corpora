00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
(Applause)

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And so I apologize to them as well.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
but the truth is

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and we hope you can fix it for us,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It's a sincere apology,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and they take it very seriously.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.
