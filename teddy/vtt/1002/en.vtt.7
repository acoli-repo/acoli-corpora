Her answer set the template

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
for the entire career I was to have after that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
She said, "What do you want to do?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that question cleared the space.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There was no program directive, no manual to follow,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
no standards in gifted education

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in that way.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And she cleared such a space

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that I endeavored from then on

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to clear a space for my students, an empty space,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
whereby they could create and make meaning

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
out of their own understanding.
