00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Her name is Pam Moran

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in Albemarle County, Virginia,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She uses smart boards, she blogs,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
she Tweets, she does Facebook,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
She's a technology leader and instructional leader.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But in her office,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Why is this old table in your office?"
