00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It started out like this:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in an inner-city urban school, 1978.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We put all the problems of the world there,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and I thought, let's let them solve it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I wanted to have them be immersed

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So I thought, well they like to play games.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;
