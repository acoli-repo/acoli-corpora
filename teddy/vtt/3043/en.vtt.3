WEBVTT

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.816
so we embedded clinical guidelines
within the software

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.016
to guide nurses and clerks

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.200
who assist with handling
some of the workload.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.656
Everyone has a birthday,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.176
but not everyone knows their birthday,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.016
so we wrote algorithms
to handle estimated birthdates

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.320
as complete dates.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.136
How do we follow up
patients living in slums

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.360
with no street and house numbers?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.080
We used landmarks to approximate
their physical addresses.
