00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
We have long and frequent power outages,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.776
low penetration of computers,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.736
slow internet connections

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.016
and a lot of patients
visiting understaffed hospitals.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.176
Since the HIV epidemic,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.856
hospitals have been struggling
to manage regular HIV treatment records

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.720
for increasing volumes of patients.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.456
For such environments,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.376
importing technology systems
developed elsewhere has not worked,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.616
but in 2006, I joined Baobab Health,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.176
a team that uses locally based engineers
