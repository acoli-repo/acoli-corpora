00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.176
a team that uses locally based engineers

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.816
to develop suitable interventions

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.696
that are addressing
health care challenges in Malawi.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.136
We designed an electronic
health record system

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.496
that is used by health care workers
while seeing patients.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.096
And in the process we realized that we
not only had to design the software,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.480
we had to implement
the infrastructure as well.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.856
We don't have enough medical staff

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.736
to comprehensively examine every patient,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.816
so we embedded clinical guidelines
within the software
