00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.480
Malawi had no IDs
to uniquely identify patients,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.616
so we had to implement unique patient IDs

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.880
to link patient records across clinics.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.360
The IDs are printed as barcodes

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.056
on labels that are stuck
on personal health booklets

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.280
kept by each patient.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.976
With this barcoded ID,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.416
a simple scan with a barcode reader

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.680
quickly pulls up the patient's records.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.736
No need to rewrite their personal details

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.176
on paper registers at every visit.
