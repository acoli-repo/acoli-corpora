00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.136
So we repurposed touch screen
point-of-sale terminals

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.856
that are meant for retail shops

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.640
to become clinical workstations.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.080
At the time, we imported
internet appliances called i-Openers

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.976
that were manufactured
during the dot-com era

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.840
by a failed US company.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.376
We modified their screens

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.776
to add touch sensors

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.120
and their power system
to run from rechargeable batteries.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.816
When we started, we didn't find
a reliable network to transmit data,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.480
especially from rural hospitals.
