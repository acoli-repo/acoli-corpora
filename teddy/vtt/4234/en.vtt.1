00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a little bit more and think and ask questions.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You know, I guess the first question is,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
why build a virtual world at all?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I think the answer to that is always going to be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
at least driven to a certain extent by the people

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
initially crazy enough to start the project, you know.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me
