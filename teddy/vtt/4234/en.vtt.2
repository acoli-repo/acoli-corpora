So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was just always trying to make things.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood
