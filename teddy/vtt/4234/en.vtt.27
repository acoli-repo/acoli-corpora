00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Thank you. John. That's great.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
(Applause)

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
John Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
not a utopian impulse?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Like for example, in the 19th century,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
were explicitly utopian.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.
