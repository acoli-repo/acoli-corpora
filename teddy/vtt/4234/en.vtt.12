00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and everything, and probably anything could happen there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
everybody's very excited,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
from moment to moment, and then there's despair

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Everything that's happening with Second Life

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.
