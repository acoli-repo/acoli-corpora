00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
what's happening here is something very different,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because the sheer scale of what people can do

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that whatever this is going to evolve into

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And let me justify that with two statements.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
create and consume information.
