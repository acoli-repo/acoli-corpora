irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that if you travel far enough, you can find out there --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
once you get there, into space.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's going to be different than here.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that anything is going to be possible.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.
