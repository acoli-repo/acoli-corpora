Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
only happens in an environment

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
if you will, that make up the virtual world.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,
