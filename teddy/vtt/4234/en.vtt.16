00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
they have code attached to them.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and that's very important.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
If anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Second Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,
