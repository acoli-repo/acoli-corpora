in as shared and social a way as possible.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
represent the best we can do to achieve that right now.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You know, another way to look at that,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So many movies, so many kids, we all sort of

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
dream about exploring space. Now, why is that?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Stop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?
