00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or electronics or metal or anything else.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so, for example -- and it's a great Second Life thing -- I had a bedroom.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
rather than opened, like on Star Trek.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.
