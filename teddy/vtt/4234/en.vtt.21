are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And so virtual worlds are the best way

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
for us to essentially organize and experience information.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
are really important in some magical way to us.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But the second thing -- and I think this one is less obvious --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information
