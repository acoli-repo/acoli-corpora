WEBVTT

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that happens all around the world at a lot of different points --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Big idea, but I think highly defensible.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So let me stop there and bring John back,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
