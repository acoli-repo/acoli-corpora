That's one way of organizing information,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that I think are the important ways that they're very different

and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
The first is that, as I said, the --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that you can possibly use with human beings.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,
