00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in three facilities in the United States right now,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and it's about as densely built out.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so of course, radically unlike the real world,
