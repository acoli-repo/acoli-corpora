00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so of course, radically unlike the real world,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
very, very quickly, and historically exponentially.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
by the amount of content that's in there,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and I think that amount is critical.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It was critical with the virtual world

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that it be this space of truly infinite possibility.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We're very sensitive to that as humans.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and you know when you can't.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,
