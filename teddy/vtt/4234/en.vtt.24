00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So that second point, that we inherently experience information together

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
or want to experience it together,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is critical to essentially, kind of,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to be together, to consume information.
