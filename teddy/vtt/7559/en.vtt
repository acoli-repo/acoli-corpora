Now, when you think of the industries
most responsible for climate change,

00:00:05.636 --> 00:00:08.196
you probably summon up
an image of an oil rig, right?

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:10.916
Maybe even a coal mine

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:12.236
or a megafarm,

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:13.796
perhaps heavy engineering.

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:18.956
But there’s one industry
that’s never mentioned in that list

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.836
even though every other industry
depends upon it.

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:25.716
I’m talking about
an economic sector that makes ...

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:26.716
nothing.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.596
It has no stock,

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.316
no warehouses,
