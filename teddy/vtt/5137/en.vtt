Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil,
slayer of demons,

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.209
protector, and omniscient observer 
of the universe—

was testing his wife’s patience.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:25.284
Historically, the union between 
Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one.

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:29.004
They maintained the equilibrium 
between thought and action

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.865
on which the well-being 
of the world depended.
