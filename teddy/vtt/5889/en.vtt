Have you ever in your life met someone
who felt like everything at their job

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:09.746
and in their industry just worked
perfectly, no room for improvement?

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:11.329
I definitely have not.

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:13.163
In fact, if I was talking to someone

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:16.246
and they started to express anything
even remotely similar to that view,

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.829
I would be like, OK, take up the disguise.
You're my boss. Undercover.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:20.829
I caught you ripping.

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:27.663
My point is, whatever you do for work,
there is clearly room for improvement,

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:32.329
whether it's making hiring practices more
inclusive or limiting the plastic waste
