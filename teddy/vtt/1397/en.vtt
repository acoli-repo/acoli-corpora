Hi, my name is Frank,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and I collect secrets.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It all started with a crazy idea

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in November of 2004.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
just like this.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They were blank on one side,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and on the other side

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I listed some simple instructions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they'd never told anyone before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I handed out these postcards randomly

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
on the streets of Washington, D.C.,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
not knowing what to expect.
