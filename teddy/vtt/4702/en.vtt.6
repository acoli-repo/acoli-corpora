00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:00.789
Does it work if there are 2 people in the room?

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.131
In line 1, we initialize n to zero.

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.399
For that one pair of people, we then increment n by 2.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.921
And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2,

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.303
which indeed matches the number of people in the room.

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.715
Suppose next that there are zero people in the room.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.302
In line 1, we initialize n to zero.

00:03:16.302 --> 00:03:18.382
As before, line 3 doesn't execute at all

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:20.724
since there aren't any pairs of people in the room,

00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:22.410
and so, n remains zero,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.183
which indeed matches the number of people in the room.

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.555
But what if there are 3 people in the room?

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:29.492
How does this algorithm fair?

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:30.321
Let's see.
