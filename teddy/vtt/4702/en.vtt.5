00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:33.557
Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth,

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:34.475
why not count

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:36.602
2, 4, 6, 8, and so on?

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:39.020
It even sounds faster, and it surely is.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.855
Let's express this optimization in pseudocode.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.317
Let n equal zero.

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:45.314
For each pair of people in room,

00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:47.902
set n = n + 2.

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:49.575
Pretty simple change, right?

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:51.366
Rather than count people one at a time,

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.709
we instead count them two at a time.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.524
This algorithm's thus twice as fast as the last.

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:57.870
But is it correct?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.664
Let's see.

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:00.789
Does it work if there are 2 people in the room?
