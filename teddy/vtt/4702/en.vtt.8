00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.099
If 1 person remains unpaired,

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.475
set n = n + 1.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.982
To solve this particular problem,

00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:06.231
we've introduced in line 4 a condition,

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:08.066
otherwise known as a branch,

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.319
that only executes if there is one person

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.195
we could not pair with another.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:14.260
So now, whether there's 1 or 3

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.533
or any odd number of people in the room,

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.821
this algorithm will now count them.

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.166
Can we do even better?

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:23.460
Well, we could count in 3's or 4's or even 5's and 10's,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.760
but beyond that it's going to get

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.630
a little bit difficult to point.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.567
At the end of the day,

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.831
whether executed by computers or humans,

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.791
algorithms are just a set of instructions
