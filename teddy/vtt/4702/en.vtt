00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:16.831
What's an algorithm?

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:17.662
In computer science,

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:19.416
an algorithm is a set of instructions

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:22.105
for solving some problem, step-by-step.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.377
Typically, algorithms are executed by computers,

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:26.544
but we humans have algorithms as well.

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:28.397
For instance, how would you go about counting

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:30.217
the number of people in a room?
