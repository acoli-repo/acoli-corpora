00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.184
So, what the pseudocode is saying

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:32.250
is that after starting at zero,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.960
for each person in the room,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.178
we'll increase n by 1.

00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:38.507
Now, is this algorithm correct?

00:01:38.507 --> 00:01:40.115
Well, let's bang on it a bit.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:42.941
Does it work if there are 2 people in the room?

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:43.721
Let's see.

00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.806
In line 1, we initialize n to zero.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.108
For each of these two people,

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:49.276
we then increment n by 1.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.858
So, in the first trip through the loop,

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:52.863
we update n from zero to 1,

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.518
on the second trip through that same loop,

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:56.767
we update n from 1 to 2.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.108
And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2,
