00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.108
And so, by this algorithm's end, n is 2,

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:02.221
which indeed matches the number of people in the room.

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.444
So far, so good.

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.196
How about a corner case, though?

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:07.160
Suppose that there are zero people in the room,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.507
besides me, who's doing the counting.

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:12.517
In line 1, we again initialize n to zero.

00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:15.039
This time, though, line 3 doesn't execute at all

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.919
since there isn't a person in the room,

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.543
and so, n remains zero,

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:20.902
which indeed matches the number of people in the room.

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:21.808
Pretty simple, right?

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.024
But counting people one a time is pretty inefficient, too, no?

00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:26.592
Surely, we can do better!

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:28.458
Why not count two people at a time?

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:33.557
Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so forth,
