00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:30.217
the number of people in a room?

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:31.432
Well, if you're like me,

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:32.928
you probably point at each person,

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:33.888
one at a time,

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:35.725
and count up from 0:

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.598
1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth.

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:39.711
Well, that's an algorithm.

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:40.845
In fact, let's try to express it

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:43.074
a bit more formally in pseudocode,

00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:43.905
English-like syntax

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.029
that resembles a programming language.

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:47.796
Let n equal 0.

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:52.588
For each person in room, set n = n + 1.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:54.085
How to interpret this pseudocode?

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:55.921
Well, line 1 declares, so to speak,

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.337
a variable called n

00:00:57.337 --> 00:00:59.716
and initializes its value to zero.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:02.051
This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm,
