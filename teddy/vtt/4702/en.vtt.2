00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:02.051
This just means that at the beginning of our algorithm,

00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:03.635
the thing with which we're counting

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.303
has a value of zero.

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:06.639
After all, before we start counting,

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:08.308
we haven't counted anything yet.

00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:10.556
Calling this variable n is just a convention.

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:12.561
I could have called it almost anything.

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:14.647
Now, line 2 demarks the start of loop,

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:17.691
a sequence of steps that will repeat some number of times.

00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.485
So, in our example, the step we're taking

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.219
is counting people in the room.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.982
Beneath line 2 is line 3,

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.493
which describes exactly how we'll go about counting.

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:27.743
The indentation implies that it's line 3

00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:28.965
that will repeat.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.184
So, what the pseudocode is saying
