00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:30.321
Let's see.

00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:32.991
In line 1, we initialize n to zero.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.281
For a pair of those people,

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.197
we then increment n by 2,

00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:37.189
but then what?

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.451
There isn't another full pair of people in the room,

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.661
so line 2 no longer applies.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:43.330
And so, by this algorithm's end,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.926
n is still 2, which isn't correct.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.258
Indeed this algorithm is said to be buggy

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:49.406
because it has a mistake.

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:51.302
Let's redress with some new pseudocode.

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:53.095
Let n equal zero.

00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:55.218
For each pair of people in room,

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.640
set n = n + 2.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.099
If 1 person remains unpaired,
