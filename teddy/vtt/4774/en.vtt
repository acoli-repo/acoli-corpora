It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial.

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:12.094
You can't unboil an egg.

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:15.509
Well, it turns out you can, sort of.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.291
What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules,

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.481
mechanical energy can undo.

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.338
Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:28.032
The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes,

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:31.006
held together by weak chemical bonds.
