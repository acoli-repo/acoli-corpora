00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:03.171
That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses

00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:06.831
that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:12.911
until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there.

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:15.156
By the time the centrifuge stops spinning,

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:20.230
the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.055
This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins.

00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:27.194
Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart,

00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:31.042
so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end
