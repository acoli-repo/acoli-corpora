00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:31.853
First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water

00:01:31.853 --> 00:01:33.953
with a chemical called urea,

00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:38.957
a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.685
and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.924
Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:49.229
at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.640
making the solution 
spread out into a thin film.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.187
Here's the key part.

00:01:54.187 --> 00:01:57.232
The solution nearest
the wall spins faster

00:01:57.232 --> 00:01:59.575
than the solution closer to the middle.

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:03.171
That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses
