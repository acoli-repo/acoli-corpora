That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not.

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:03.521
According to a chemical idea

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.793
called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility,

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:10.093
anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up,

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:14.564
can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps.

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.836
But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further,

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:20.718
and cooling them down
will only freeze them,

00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:22.322
so here's the trick:

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:25.273
spin them around ridiculously fast.

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.717
I'm not kidding.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:28.198
Here's how it works.

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:31.853
First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water
