00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:31.042
so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:35.897
that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first.

00:02:35.897 --> 00:02:40.104
This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:44.276
since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber.

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:48.867
But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:53.751
Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce,

00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.223
partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates,

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:59.179
just like cooked egg whites

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.828
and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs.
