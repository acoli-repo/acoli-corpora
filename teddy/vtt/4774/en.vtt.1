00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:31.006
held together by weak chemical bonds.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.596
Adding heat disrupts those bonds,

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:39.630
allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.671
This process is called denaturing.

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.820
The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.807
and start to form 
new bonds with each other,

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.074
more and more as the heat increases,

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:56.254
until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass,

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:58.183
a boiled egg.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.648
That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not.
