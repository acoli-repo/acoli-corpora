00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.828
and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs.

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.143
This spinning technique has the potential

00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:09.201
to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:11.574
than other ways to refold proteins,

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:16.102
so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster.

00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:18.550
And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.271
before trying to uncook all of your food.

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.025
Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:29.848
because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together,

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:33.154
it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity.
