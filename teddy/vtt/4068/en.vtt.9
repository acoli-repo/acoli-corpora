WEBVTT

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.918
It's intelligent and has cameras,
lidar and radar,

00:04:31.942 --> 00:04:34.634
so it can detect and avoid
unexpected obstacles.

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:37.548
And the team really focused
on making it efficient,

00:04:37.572 --> 00:04:41.017
so the batteries are small, light,
and they last longer.

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:43.994
For reference, the Vahana battery

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:47.498
is less than half the size
of a Tesla Model S battery.

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:49.085
It's about 40 kilowatt-hours.

00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.275
And you can hot swap the batteries
in just a few minutes.

00:04:53.124 --> 00:04:54.791
And I do think that in a few years,

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.061
people will be comfortable
getting by themselves

00:04:57.085 --> 00:05:01.180
in a self-piloted, electric,
VTOL air taxi.
