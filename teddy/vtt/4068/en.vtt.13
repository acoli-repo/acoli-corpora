00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.941
RL: So, one of the things
we're really focusing on

00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:34.196
is, really, the cost.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.482
So you can really wrap
a business around that.

00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:40.272
And so, that's why some of the features
are really driven by price.

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:43.685
And the 40-dollar price tag
is really a target that we're aiming for.

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.510
Which should make it accessible
to a larger crowd than this one.

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:51.112
CA: The biggest blockage
in terms of when this rolls out

00:06:51.136 --> 00:06:54.692
is probably not the technology
at this point -- it's regulation, right?

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.319
RL: That's probably true, yes,
I would agree with that.

00:06:57.343 --> 00:07:00.120
The technology need to mature
in terms of safety,
