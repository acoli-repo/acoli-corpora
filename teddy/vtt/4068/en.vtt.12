Rodin Lyasoff: Ours is, yes.

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:02.871
CA: Yours is.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.141
I mean, someone comes out of their car,

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:08.369
the door opens, they get in,
there's no one else in there.

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.059
This thing takes off.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:11.710
Could we do a poll here?

00:06:11.734 --> 00:06:13.916
Because these are
early adopters in this room.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.179
I want to know who here is excited

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:22.101
Well, there you go!

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.324
RL: It's pretty good.

00:06:23.348 --> 00:06:24.688
CA: That is pretty awesome,

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:27.006
half of TED is completely
stark staring bonkers.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.304
