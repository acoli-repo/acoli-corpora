00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.014
But it's 30 minutes versus two hours,

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:32.704
it costs around 60 dollars,

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:33.995
and you get to fly.

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.149
We're not there yet,

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:38.490
but we are a lot closer
than you might think.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:40.236
So one of the first things we need

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.465
is we need an aircraft that can
take off and land in small spaces

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.530
and quickly take you where you want to go.

00:02:45.554 --> 00:02:47.822
And helicopters can do that today,

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:51.670
but traditionally, helicopters have been
just a little bit too expensive,

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:53.361
just a little too hard to pilot

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:57.562
and just a little too noisy to be used
for daily transportation in cities.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.419
Well, electric flight and autonomy
are changing that.
