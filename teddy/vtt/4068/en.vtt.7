00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.791
Commercial flights are already automated
for most of their duration,

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.426
and I believe there will come a day

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.908
when we won't even trust an airplane
that required a human to fly.

00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:40.585
So, one of our teams at A3

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.077
wanted to see just how close
this future really was.

00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:47.315
So they built and flew a prototype
of one such vehicle.

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.022
And they made a point of only using

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:51.498
mature, commercially available
technologies today.

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:53.378
We call it Vahana.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.292
It's fully electric.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:59.920
It takes off and lands vertically,
but flies forward like a regular airplane.

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.928
It's fully self-piloted.
