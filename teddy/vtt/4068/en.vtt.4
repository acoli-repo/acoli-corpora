00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:00.695
to traveling on the ground.

00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:02.627
So imagine this:

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.609
you call an Uber, it takes you
to a nearby landing spot --

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.006
we call these vertiports --

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.044
there's an airplane waiting for you there,

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:12.347
flies you over all
of the traffic in the middle,

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:15.665
and on the other side, another Uber
takes you to your friend's house.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:16.840
And I said Uber,

00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:19.950
but I really think we need
to congratulate the Lyft branding team

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:22.442
for their forward thinking
in choosing their brand.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:24.418
(Laughter)

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:25.688
So in that example,

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.665
OK, there are a few extra steps, I admit.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.014
But it's 30 minutes versus two hours,
