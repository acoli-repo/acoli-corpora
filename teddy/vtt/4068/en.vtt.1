00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.061
So, a little compare and contrast.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:34.078
In the last century,

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:37.704
large commercial airplanes
have connected cities across the globe.

00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:38.895
And 100 years ago,

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:40.998
it would have been
unthinkable for all of us

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:43.882
to fly here from around the world
for a five-day conference.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:47.104
But we did, and most of us
probably without a second thought.

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:50.104
And that's a remarkable
achievement for humanity.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:54.836
But on a day-to-day basis,
we still spend a lot of time in cars.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.527
Or actively trying to avoid it.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.408
