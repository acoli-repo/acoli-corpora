00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.408
Some of my best friends
live in San Francisco,

00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:03.058
I live in Mountain View,
about 40 miles away.

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:04.755
We're all busy.

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:05.958
At the end of the day,

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.871
we're separated by something like
two hours of heavy traffic.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:11.505
So frankly, we haven't seen
each other in a few months.

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:15.452
Now, I work in downtown San Jose,
which is near the airport.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:19.847
And there are actually days
when I can leave work,

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.203
get on a plane and fly to Los Angeles

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.188
faster than I can drive to San Francisco.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.736
Cities are only getting more populated,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.649
the roads are full, and it's really
difficult to expand them.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.029
And so in a lot of places,
