00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.928
It's fully self-piloted.

00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:05.126
You push a button, it takes off,
flies and lands, all by itself.

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.299
The prototype that you see here

00:04:07.323 --> 00:04:09.776
is designed to carry
a single passenger and luggage.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.818
And it can go about
20 miles in 15 minutes.

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:16.190
And our estimate for a trip like that
is it would cost around 40 dollars,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.334
which you can really
build a business around.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.802
It has multiple redundant
motors and batteries,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:24.167
you can lose one, it will continue
flying and land normally.

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.671
It's pretty quiet.

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:29.196
When it's flying overhead, it will be
quieter than a Prius on the highway.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.918
It's intelligent and has cameras,
lidar and radar,
