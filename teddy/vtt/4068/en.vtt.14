The technology need to mature
in terms of safety,

00:07:00.144 --> 00:07:03.103
to get to the safety levels
that we expect from aircraft.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:06.459
But I don't think there are
any blockers there,

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:07.920
just work needs to get done.

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:09.682
CA: So, first, this is ride sharing.

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.349
Are we that far away from a time

00:07:11.373 --> 00:07:14.015
when lots of people have
one of these in their garage

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.854
and just kind of, go direct
to their friend's house?

00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:20.997
RL: My personal view is that ride sharing
actually allows you to operate

00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.069
that entire business
much more efficiently.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.688
You know, there are millennials
that say they never want to own a car.

00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:31.522
I think they'll probably feel
even stronger about aircraft.
