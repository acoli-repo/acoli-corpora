00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.029
And so in a lot of places,

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:33.212
there really aren't a lot
of good solutions

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.969
for getting around traffic.

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.351
But what if you could fly over it?

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:40.804
The sky is underutilized,

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:43.907
and I would argue it will never be
as congested as the roads are.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.085
First of all, you've got
a whole other dimension,

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.156
but also just safety considerations
and air-traffic management

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.863
will not allow bumper-to-bumper
traffic in the sky.

00:01:53.887 --> 00:01:55.800
Which means, in many cases,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.871
flying can be a long-term,
compelling alternative

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:00.695
to traveling on the ground.
