00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.182
I love airplanes.

00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:03.841
Oh -- I love airplanes.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.333
So, when I went to college
in the late 90s,

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:09.863
it was obvious that I was
going to study aerospace.

00:00:09.887 --> 00:00:12.252
And you wouldn't believe
how many people told me,

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.363
"Oh no, not aerospace.

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:15.927
Aerospace is going to be boring,

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.305
everything in aerospace
has already been done."

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.661
Well, they were a little bit off the mark.

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:23.423
And in fact, I think the next decade

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:25.645
is going to be another
golden age for aviation.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.868
For one thing, and this is
where I get excited,

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:29.921
flight is about to get
a lot more personal.

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.061
So, a little compare and contrast.
