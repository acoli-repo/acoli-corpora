00:04:57.085 --> 00:05:01.180
in a self-piloted, electric,
VTOL air taxi.

00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:03.871
But the team is busy
working on the next version,

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:06.125
which is going to carry
at least two passengers

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:07.545
and fly quite a bit farther.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.141
But more importantly, there are
over 20 companies around the world

00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.818
working on vehicles
just like this one right now.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.307
My best guess is in the next five years,

00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:20.783
you'll start seeing
vertiports in some cities,

00:05:20.807 --> 00:05:23.982
and little airplane icons
on your ride-sharing apps.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.451
And it might begin with a dozen,

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:28.744
but eventually, we could have
hundreds of these,

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:29.994
flying around our cities.
