00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.419
Well, electric flight and autonomy
are changing that.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:03.736
Electric flight, in particular,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.482
unlocks new possibilities
for vehicle configurations

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:09.156
that we just could not
explore in the past.

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.037
If you use electric motors,

00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:13.410
you can have many of them
around the aircraft,

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:15.442
and it doesn't add a lot of extra weight.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.490
And that gives you redundancy and safety.

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:19.729
And also, they are cleaner,
cheaper and quieter

00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:21.577
than internal combustion engines.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.529
Autonomy allows the transportation
network to scale,

00:03:24.553 --> 00:03:27.082
and I actually think
it makes the aircraft safer.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.791
Commercial flights are already automated
for most of their duration,
