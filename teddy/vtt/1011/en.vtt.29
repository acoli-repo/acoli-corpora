00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The only thing that I have done

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is I have varied the order

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in which that information is presented.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
If I start you off easy,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
to be engaged.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So let me recap.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I have talked about four techniques

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
for mitigating the problem of choice overload --
