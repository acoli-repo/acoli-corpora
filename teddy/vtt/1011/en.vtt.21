00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Because it doesn't feel like real money.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And it turns out

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that making it feel more concrete

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
can actually be a very positive tool

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to use in getting people to save more.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and Alessandro Previtero,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we did a study with people at ING --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
employees that are all working at ING --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and now these people were all in a session

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And during that session,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but we added one little thing.
