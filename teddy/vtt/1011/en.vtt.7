00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to buy a jar of jam.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now we see the opposite effect.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Of the people who stopped when there were 24,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Of the people who stopped when there were six,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
well now we saw that 30 percent of them

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
actually bought a jar of jam.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now if you do the math,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
if they encountered six

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
than if they encountered 24.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is probably good for us --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
at least it's good for our waistlines --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us
