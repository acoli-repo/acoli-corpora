00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
completely make up your car.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Now these decisions vary

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in the number of choices that they offer per decision.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Car colors, exterior car colors --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I've got 56 choices.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So now what I'm going to do

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So half of the customers

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to low choice, four gearshifts.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The other half of the customers

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to 56 car colors, high choice.
