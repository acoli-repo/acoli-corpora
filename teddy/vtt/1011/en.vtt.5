00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
well how come you never buy anything?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here's their olive oil aisle.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
including those that were in a locked case

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I asked the manager,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that would show up everyday,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with cameras ready usually.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We decided to do a little experiment,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and we picked jam for our experiment.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Here's their jam aisle.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They had 348 different kinds of jam.
