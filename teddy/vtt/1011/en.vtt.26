00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It turns out we can actually

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
handle a lot more information than we think we can,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
we've just got to take it a little easier.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We have to gradually increase the complexity.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Let's take a very, very complicated decision:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
buying a car.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Here's a German car manufacturer

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
You've got to make 60 different decisions,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
completely make up your car.
