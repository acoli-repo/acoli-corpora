00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And what we found was that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the more funds offered,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
indeed, there was less participation rate.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So if you look at the extremes,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
those plans that offered you two funds,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
participation rates were around in the mid-70s --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
still not as high as we want it to be.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
participation rates have now dropped

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to about the 60th percentile.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now it turns out

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that even if you do choose to participate

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when there are more choices present,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
even then, it has negative consequences.
