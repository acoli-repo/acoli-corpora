at least it's good for our waistlines --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000

We choose not to choose,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
even when it goes against our best self-interests.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of nearly a million Americans

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from about 650 plans
