00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that these CEOs engaged in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and how much time they spent engaging

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in making decisions related to these tasks.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And they found that the average CEO

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
50 percent of their decisions

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
were made in nine minutes or less.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Only about 12 percent of the decisions

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
did they make an hour or more of their time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Think about your own choices.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Do you know how many choices
