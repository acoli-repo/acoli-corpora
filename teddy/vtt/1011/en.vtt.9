00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from about 650 plans

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
all in the U.S.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And what we looked at

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
was whether the number of fund offerings

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
available in a retirement savings plan,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the 401(k) plan,

was that indeed there was a correlation.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that ranged from offering people

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And what we found was that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the more funds offered,
