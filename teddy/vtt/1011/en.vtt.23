WEBVTT

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We can handle more categories

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
than we can handle choices.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So for example,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the magazine aisles range anywhere

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
from 331 different kinds of magazines

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
all the way up to 664.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But you know what?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
If I show you 600 magazines

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and I divide them up into 10 categories,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
versus I show you 400 magazines

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and divide them up into 20 categories,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you believe that I have given you
