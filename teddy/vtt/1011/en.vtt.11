00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when there are more choices present,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
even then, it has negative consequences.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So for those people who did choose to participate,

are the kinds of decisions

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
when you're considering their future financial well-being.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Well, over the past decade,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we have observed three main negative consequences
