00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at least at that time it was truly upscale.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was a store called Draeger's.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and over 500 different kinds

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of fruits and vegetables

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I used to love going to this store,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but on one occasion I asked myself,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
well how come you never buy anything?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here's their olive oil aisle.
