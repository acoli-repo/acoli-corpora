00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Think about your own choices.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Do you know how many choices

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
make it into your nine minute category

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
versus your one hour category?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
How well do you think you're doing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000

I want to talk about the problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and some potential solutions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now as I talk about this problem,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to have some questions for you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I'm going to want to know your answers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So when I ask you a question,
