00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Okay, there's some.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
clap your hands.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Okay, a bit more.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Now it turns out you're right.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
but you know what?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
(Laughter)

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The categories need to say something

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to the chooser, not the choice-maker.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And you often see that problem

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
