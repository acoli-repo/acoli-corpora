00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and actually picking from that stunning display.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So what I want to propose to you today

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
are four simple techniques --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
techniques that we have tested in one way or another

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in different research venues --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that you can easily apply

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
in your businesses.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The first: Cut.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You've heard it said before,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
but it's never been more true than today,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that less is more.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."
