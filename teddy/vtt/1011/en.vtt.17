They're all important choices."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And if your employees can't tell them apart,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
neither can your consumers."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now before we started our session this afternoon,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I had a chat with Gary.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And Gary said that he would be willing

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to offer people in this audience

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
an all-expenses-paid free vacation

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to the most beautiful road in the world.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Here's a description of the road.
