00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Here's their jam aisle.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They had 348 different kinds of jam.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We set up a little tasting booth

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
right near the entrance of the store.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We there put out six different flavors of jam

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or 24 different flavors of jam,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we looked at two things:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
First, in which case

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
than when there were six,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
about 40 percent.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The next thing we looked at

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is in which case were people more likely

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to buy a jar of jam.
