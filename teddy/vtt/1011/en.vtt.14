People are always upset when I say, "Cut."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
get rid of those extraneous redundant options,

well there's an increase in sales,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
When the Golden Cat Corporation

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
they saw an increase in profits
