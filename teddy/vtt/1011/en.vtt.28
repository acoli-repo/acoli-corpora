00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to 56 car colors, high choice.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
What am I going to look at?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
How engaged you are.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
If you keep hitting the default button per decision,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
