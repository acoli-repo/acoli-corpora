What this stuff and deepfake is doing

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.569
is making it easier and more accessible
to manipulate video,

00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:11.964
just like Photoshop did
for manipulating images, some time ago.

00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.739
I prefer to think about

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:19.799
how this technology could bring
humanity to other technology

00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:22.117
and bring us all closer together.

00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.500
Now that you've seen this,

00:09:24.524 --> 00:09:26.426
think about the possibilities.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.333
Right off the bat, you're going to see it
in live events and concerts, like this.
