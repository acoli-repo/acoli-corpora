00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.982
We had to do a lot of capture with this.

00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:34.643
Once we had this enormous amount of data,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.442
we built and trained deep neural networks.

00:05:39.117 --> 00:05:40.863
And when we were finished with that,

00:05:40.887 --> 00:05:43.331
in 16 milliseconds,

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:46.467
the neural network can look at my image

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.419
and figure out everything about my face.

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:55.934
It can compute my expression,
my wrinkles, my blood flow --

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.275
even how my eyelashes move.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.760
This is then rendered
and displayed up there
