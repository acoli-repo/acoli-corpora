Isn't this like "deepfake"
and face-swapping

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.271
that you guys may have heard of?

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.358
Well, yeah.

00:08:07.074 --> 00:08:10.026
In fact, we are using
some of the same technology

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.650
that deepfake is using.

00:08:11.954 --> 00:08:16.553
Deepfake is 2-D and image based,
while ours is full 3-D

00:08:16.577 --> 00:08:18.783
and way more powerful.

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:20.870
But they're very related.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.569
And now I can hear you thinking,

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:24.871
"Darn it!

00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:28.696
I though I could at least
trust and believe in video.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.547
If it was live video,
didn't it have to be true?"
