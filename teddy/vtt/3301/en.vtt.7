We had to first figure out
what my face actually looked like.

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.418
Not just a photograph or a 3-D scan,

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:44.363
but what it actually looked like
in any photograph,

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:46.847
how light interacts with my skin.

00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:53.017
Luckily for us, about three blocks away
from our Los Angeles studio

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:55.250
is this place called ICT.

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:56.980
They're a research lab

00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.407
that's associated with the University
of Southern California.
