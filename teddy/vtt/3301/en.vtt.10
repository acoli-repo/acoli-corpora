And machine learning needs a ton of data.

00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:08.426
So I sat down in front of some
high-resolution motion-capturing device.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.521
And also, we did this traditional
motion capture with markers.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:16.672
We created a whole bunch
of images of my face

00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:20.783
and moving point clouds
that represented that shapes of my face.

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:24.807
Man, I made a lot of expressions,

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.291
I said different lines
in different emotional states ...

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.982
We had to do a lot of capture with this.
