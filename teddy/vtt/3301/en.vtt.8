00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.164
It has a zillion
individually controlled lights

00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:10.061
and a whole bunch of cameras.

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:16.176
And with that, we can reconstruct my face
under a myriad of lighting conditions.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.171
We even captured the blood flow

00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.287
and how my face changes
when I make expressions.

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:28.714
This let us build a model of my face
that, quite frankly, is just amazing.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:33.732
It's got an unfortunate
level of detail, unfortunately.
