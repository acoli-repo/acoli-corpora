00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:40.537
Even without this, there are simple tricks
that you can do with video

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:43.337
like how you frame a shot

00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:47.723

in visual effects for a long time,

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:53.525
and I've known for a long time

that with enough effort,
we can fool anyone about anything.
