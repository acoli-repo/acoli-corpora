of the person who's controlling
the digital human

00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:32.878
in real time?

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.268
In fact, that's our goal:

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:39.053
If you were having
a conversation with DigiDoug

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:40.314
one-on-one,

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:46.997
is it real enough so that you could tell
whether or not I was lying to you?

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.334
So that was our goal.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.617
About a year and a half ago,
we set off to achieve this goal.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.540
What I'm going to do now is take you
basically on a little bit of a journey

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:02.490
to see exactly what we had to do
to get where we are.
