00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:33.854
we've been putting
humans and creatures into film

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:35.617
that you accept as real.

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:39.379
If they're happy, you should feel happy.

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:45.419
And if they feel pain,
you should empathize with them.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.657
We're getting pretty good at it, too.

00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:51.427
But it's really, really difficult.

00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:55.061
Effects like these take thousands of hours

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.752
and hundreds of really talented artists.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.392
But things have changed.
