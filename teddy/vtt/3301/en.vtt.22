00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:02.925
without you actually being able
to see my real face,

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:04.633
so you can do some comparison.

00:11:06.573 --> 00:11:08.449
So let me take off my helmet here.

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:13.243
Yeah, don't worry,

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:15.695
(Laughter)

00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:18.886

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:22.488

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.301

00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:26.892
So this is where we are.

00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:31.698
We're on the cusp of being able
to interact with digital humans
