What you see up there is a digital human.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.974
I'm wearing an inertial
motion capture suit

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:37.577
that's figuring what my body is doing.

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:41.426
And I've got a single camera here
that's watching my face

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.291
and feeding some machine-learning software
that's taking my expressions,

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.894
like, "Hm, hm, hm,"

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.042
and transferring it to that guy.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.642
We call him "DigiDoug."

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:02.018
He's actually a 3-D character
that I'm controlling live in real time.
