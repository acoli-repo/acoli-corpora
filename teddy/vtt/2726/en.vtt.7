00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.216
are stuck in a paradigm
that is rote and perfunctory,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.296
devoid of life, devoid of vision

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.040
and devoid of soul.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.896
Let me explain what I mean like this.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.696
One of the great blessings
of being a rabbi

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.376
is standing under the chuppah,
under the wedding canopy, with a couple,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.656
and helping them proclaim publicly

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.936
and make holy the love
that they found for one another.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.896
I want to ask you now, though,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.816
to think maybe from your own experience

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.256
or maybe just imagine it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.176
about the difference
between the intensity of the experience

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.936
under the wedding canopy,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.176
and maybe the experience
of the sixth or seventh anniversary.
