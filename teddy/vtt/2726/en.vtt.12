00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.976
about 12 or 13 years ago,
I set out to try to determine

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.536
if there was any way

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.736
that I could reclaim the heart
of my own Jewish tradition,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.376
to help make it meaningful
and purposeful again

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.840
in a world on fire.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.936
I started to wonder,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.096
what if we could harness
some of the great minds of our generation

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.096
and think in a bold and robust
and imaginative way again

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.216
about what the next iteration
of religious life would look like?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.296
Now, we had no money,
no space, no game plan,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.776
but we did have email.
