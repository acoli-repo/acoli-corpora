00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.856
Because we know
that social change only happens --

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.936
(Applause)

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.840
when we are awake enough
to see that the house is on fire.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.696
The second principle is hope,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.340
and I want to say this about hope.

00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:43.496
Hope is not naive,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.456
and hope is not an opiate.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.536
Hope may be the single
greatest act of defiance

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.896
against a politics of pessimism

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.336
and against a culture of despair.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.256
Because what hope does for us

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.056
is it lifts us out of the container

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.776
that holds us and constrains us
from the outside,
