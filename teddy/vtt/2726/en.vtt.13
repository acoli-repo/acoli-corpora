00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.776
but we did have email.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.496
So my friend Melissa and I
sat down and we wrote an email

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.376
which we sent out
to a few friends and colleagues.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.216
It basically said this:

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.160
"Before you bail on religion,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.616
why don't we come together
this Friday night

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.760
and see what we might make
of our own Jewish inheritance?"

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.896
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.480
It turned out 135 people came.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.536
They were cynics and seekers,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.296
atheists and rabbis.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.856
Many people said that night
that it was the first time
