WEBVTT

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.456
in which we have unprecedented access

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.376
to information about every global tragedy

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.856
that happens on every corner
of this Earth.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.576
Within 12 hours, 20 million people

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.176
saw that image
of Aylan Kurdi's little body

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.576
washed up on the Turkish shore.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.960
We all saw this picture.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.256
We saw this picture
of a five-year-old child

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.720
pulled out of the rubble
of his building in Aleppo.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.536
And once we see these images,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.200
we are called to a certain kind of action.
