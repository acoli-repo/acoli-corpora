It's supposed to be about
giving people back a sense of purpose,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.256
a sense of hope,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.216
a sense that they and their dreams
fundamentally matter in this world

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.800
that tells them
that they don't matter at all.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.536
The third principle
is the principle of mightiness.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.216
There's a rabbinic tradition
that we are to walk around

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.536
with two slips of paper in our pockets.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.976
One says, "I am but dust and ashes."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.696
It's not all about me.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.240
I can't control everything,
and I cannot do this on my own.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.136
The other slip of paper says,
"For my sake the world was created."
