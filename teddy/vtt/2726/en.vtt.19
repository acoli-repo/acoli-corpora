00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.200
we are called to a certain kind of action.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.936
My tradition tells a story
of a traveler who is walking down a road

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.496
when he sees a beautiful house on fire,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.056

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.616

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.496
and it is our job to keep our hearts
and our eyes open,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.056
and to recognize
that it's our responsibility

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.656
to help put out the flames.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.736
This is extremely difficult to do.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.536
Psychologists tell us that the more
we learn about what's broken in our world,
