We need to call this what it is:

a great failure of religion.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.960
But the thing is, this isn't even the only
challenge that religion faces today.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.776
At the very same time

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.416
that we need religion
to be a strong force against extremism,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.456
it is suffering
from a second pernicious trend,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.280
what I call religious routine-ism.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.416
This is when our institutions
and our leaders

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.216
are stuck in a paradigm
that is rote and perfunctory,
