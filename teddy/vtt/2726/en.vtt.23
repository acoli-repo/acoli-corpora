between January and July in Chicago.

We went into that church
and heard Rev. Moss preach,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.096
and after he did,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.376
this choir of gorgeous women,
100 women strong,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.360
stood up and began to sing.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.336
"I need you. You need me.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.040
I love you. I need you to survive."

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.416

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.016

is supposed to be about.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.736
It's supposed to be about
giving people back a sense of purpose,
