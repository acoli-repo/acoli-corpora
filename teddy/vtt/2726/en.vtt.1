00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.256
where my six-month-old baby girl

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.136
lay sleeping sweetly,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.496
and I heard the rhythm of her breath,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.096
and I felt this sense of urgency
coursing through my body.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.176
We were living through a time
of tectonic shifts in ideologies,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.856
in politics, in religion, in populations.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.960
Everything felt so precarious.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.736
And I remember thinking,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
"My God, what kind of world
did we bring this child into?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.016
And what was I as a mother
and a religious leader

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.560
willing to do about it?
