00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.176
to be a container in which
we would hold on to the remnants

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.096
of that sacred, revelatory encounter

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.216
that birthed the religion
in the first place.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.736
The problem is that after a few centuries,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.000
the date remains on the calendar,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.536
but the love affair is long dead.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.856
That's when we find ourselves
in endless, mindless repetitions

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.096

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.856
rising and being seated
because someone has asked us to,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.776
holding onto jealously guarded doctrine

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.656
that's completely and wildly out of step
with our contemporary reality,
