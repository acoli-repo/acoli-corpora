00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.616
And as we entered the 21st century,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.360
it was very clear that religious extremism
was once again on the rise.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.016
Our studies now show

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.296
that over the course
of the past 15, 20 years,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.456
hostilities and religion-related violence

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.416
have been on the increase
all over the world.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.696
But we don't even need
the studies to prove it,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.896
because I ask you,
how many of us are surprised today

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.696
when we hear the stories
of a bombing or a shooting,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.536
when we later find out
that the last word that was uttered

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.376
before the trigger is pulled
or the bomb is detonated
