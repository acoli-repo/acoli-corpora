00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and it's a time machine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And everyone in this room has to get into it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you cannot stay where you are.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or Twitter or "American Idol."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I don't know.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I understand that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.
