00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.976
In 2015, the leaders of the world
made a big promise.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.736
A promise that over the next 15 years,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.336
the lives of billions of people
are going to get better

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.440
with no one left behind.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.416
That promise is the Sustainable
Development Goals --

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.640
the SDGs.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.296
We're now three years in;

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.656
a fifth of the way into the journey.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.376
The clock is ticking.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.936
If we offtrack now,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.200
it's going to get harder and harder
to hit those goals.
