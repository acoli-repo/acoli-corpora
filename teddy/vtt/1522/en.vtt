00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:02.899
So let me ask for a show of hands.

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.091
How many people here are over the age of 48?

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.972
Well, there do seem to be a few.

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:12.147
Well, congratulations,

00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:16.017
because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:19.115
you are now in excess of the average life span

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:21.902
of somebody who was born in 1900.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:25.436
But look what happened in the course of that century.

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.098
If you follow that curve,

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:29.712
you'll see that it starts way down there.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:32.181
There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.
