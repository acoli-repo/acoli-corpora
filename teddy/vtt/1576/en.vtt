00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start with day and night.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Life evolved under conditions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of light and darkness,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
light and then darkness.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so plants and animals

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
developed their own internal clocks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so that they would be ready for these changes in light.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These are chemical clocks,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and in some that only have one cell.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'll give you an example --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you fly it all the way across the continent,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and you drop it into a sloped cage,
