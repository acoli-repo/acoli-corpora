Arthur Brooks: Starting
when I was eight or nine years old,

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:07.667
I literally wanted to be the greatest
French horn player in the world.

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.437
That was what I always wanted to do.

00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:10.987
That was my whole life dream.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.590
Adam Grant: What was behind that?

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:13.927
AB: I was ambitious.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.078
I wanted to play for a lot of people.

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.631
And I guess that was just simply expressed

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:20.853
in the only thing
that I really knew how to do,

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.600
the only thing I really cared about,

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:23.901
which was music.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.092
(Music)

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.140
AG: Arthur Brooks was a natural.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:30.024
He could read music
before he could actually read.
