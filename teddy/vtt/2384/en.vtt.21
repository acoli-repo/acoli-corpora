00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.110
but at the same time, the rate of return

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.755
to capital also rose

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.180
so that the gap between the two

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.636
did not really change.

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.886
So during the 20th century,

00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.530
you had a very unique combination of events.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.547
First, a very low rate of return

00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:45.563
due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:47.868
destruction of wealth, inflation,

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:49.848
bankruptcy during the Great Depression,

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:51.513
and all of this reduced

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.263
the private rate of return to wealth

00:10:53.263 --> 00:10:55.158
to unusually low levels

00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:57.497
between 1914 and 1945.

00:10:57.497 --> 00:10:59.333
And then, in the postwar period,

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.570
you had unusually high growth rate,
