00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:31.838
has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:35.347
although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.

00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:37.294
Okay? So this is the total value

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:39.510
of wealth relative to income,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.623
and you can see that in particular in Europe,

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:45.483
we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.

00:05:45.483 --> 00:05:47.328
So there are really two

00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:49.859
different parts of the story here.

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:50.978
One has to do with

00:05:50.978 --> 00:05:53.420
the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.098
and there is nothing bad per se, of course,

00:05:55.098 --> 00:05:56.845
in accumulating a lot of wealth,

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:59.713
and in particular if it is more diffuse

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.107
and less concentrated.
