00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.341
probably the best model to explain

00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.438
why wealth is so much

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:34.624
more concentrated than income

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:37.736
is a dynamic, dynastic model

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:40.200
where individuals have a long horizon

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.956
and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:45.566
If people were accumulating wealth

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:47.569
only for life cycle reasons,

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.582
you know, to be able to consume

00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:51.169
when they are old,

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.542
then the level of wealth inequality

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.859
should be more or less in line

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:57.828
with the level of income inequality.

00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.756
But it will be very difficult to explain

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:01.950
why you have so much more wealth inequality
