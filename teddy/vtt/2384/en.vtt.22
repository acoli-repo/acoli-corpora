00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.570
you had unusually high growth rate,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.944
partly due to the reconstruction.

00:11:04.944 --> 00:11:06.869
You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:08.420
you had five percent growth rate

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.570
between 1950 and 1980

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.213
largely due to reconstruction,

00:11:13.213 --> 00:11:15.564
and also due to very large demographic growth,

00:11:15.564 --> 00:11:17.705
the Baby Boom Cohort effect.

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.143
Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,

00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:21.818
or at least the population growth

00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:24.586
is supposed to decline in the future,

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:28.242
and the best projections we have is that

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:30.070
the long-run growth is going to be closer
