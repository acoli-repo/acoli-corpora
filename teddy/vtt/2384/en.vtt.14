00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:01.950
why you have so much more wealth inequality

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.434
than income inequality

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:04.710
with a pure life cycle model,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.741
so you need a story

00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.429
where people also care

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:10.960
about wealth accumulation for other reasons.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.884
So typically, they want to transmit

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:16.210
wealth to the next generation, to their children,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.978
or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:20.746
because of the prestige, the
power that goes with wealth.

00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:22.130
So there must be other reasons

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.120
for accumulating wealth than just life cycle

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.888
to explain what we see in the data.

00:07:26.888 --> 00:07:30.234
Now, in a large class of dynamic models
