00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.472
so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.969
Now, you should not be surprised

00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:06.505
by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.121
because, in fact, this is what happened

00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:10.192
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:13.543
And this was in a way very obvious to everybody

00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:15.321
for a simple reason, which is that growth

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.509
was close to zero percent

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.130
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.662
Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.658
but very slow growth of population

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.655
and output per capita,

00:09:26.655 --> 00:09:28.539
whereas the rate of return on capital

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:30.395
of course was not zero percent.
