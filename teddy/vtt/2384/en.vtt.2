00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.795
We know a little bit more today

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.316
than we used to know, 
but we still know too little,

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:05.992
and certainly there are 
many different processes —

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:08.290
economic, social, political —

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.717
that need to be studied more.

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.697
And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.958
but that doesn't mean that other important forces

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.162
do not exist.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.434
So most of the data I'm going to present

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:20.639
comes from this database

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:21.899
that's available online:

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.384
the World Top Incomes Database.

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.487
So this is the largest existing

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.940
historical database on inequality,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.290
and this comes from the effort

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.182
of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.
