00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:01.188
depends on many different factors

00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:03.273
that are very difficult to predict:

00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:05.388
technology and the development

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.972
of capital-intensive techniques.

00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:10.991
So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.367
in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:17.229
the energy sector, but it could be in the future

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:20.941
that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:22.830
and that this would be a bigger share

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.740
of the total capital stock that it is today.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.734
Well, we are very far from this,

00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:28.500
and from now, what's going on

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.289
in the real estate sector, the energy sector,
