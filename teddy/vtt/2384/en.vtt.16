00:07:59.303 --> 00:08:00.955
The important point is that,

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:01.965
in any such model,

00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:04.521
for a given variance of such shocks,

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.557
the equilibrium level of wealth inequality

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:11.394
will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.

00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:14.263
And intuitively, the reason why the difference

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:16.107
between the rate of return to wealth

00:08:16.107 --> 00:08:17.862
and the growth rate is important

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.174
is that initial wealth inequalities

00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:22.565
will be amplified at a faster pace

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.634
with a bigger r minus g.

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.108
So take a simple example,

00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:29.874
with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,

00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:31.982
wealth holders only need to reinvest
