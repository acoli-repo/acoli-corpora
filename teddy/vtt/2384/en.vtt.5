00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.604
So there is more going on here,

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.213
but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.879
because I want to focus on wealth inequality.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.860
So let me just show you a very simple indicator

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.210
about the income inequality part.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.664
So this is the share of total income

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.452
going to the top 10 percent.

00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:48.624
So you can see that one century ago,

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:52.201
it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.939
and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.210
so there was more inequality in Europe.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.234
Then there was a sharp decline

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:01.765
during the first half of the 20th century,
