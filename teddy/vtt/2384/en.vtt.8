00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.020
for income inequality.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.570
So wealth concentration was higher

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.813
in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:07.647
and now it is the opposite.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.638
But you can also show two things:

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:13.339
First, the general level of wealth inequality

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.994
is always higher than income inequality.

00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:18.334
So remember, for income inequality,

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.662
the share going to the top 10 percent

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:24.960
was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.772
whereas for wealth, the share is always

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:29.831
between 60 and 90 percent.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.347
Okay, so that's fact number one,
