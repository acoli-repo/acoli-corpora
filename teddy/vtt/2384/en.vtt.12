00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.107
and less concentrated.

00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:03.852
So what we really want to focus on

00:06:03.852 --> 00:06:06.233
is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.533
and what's going to happen in the future.

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.558
How can we account for the fact that

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:14.220
until World War I, wealth inequality was so high

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.410
and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.737
and how can we think about the future?

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:24.623
So let me come to some of the explanations

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:26.759
and speculations about the future.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.354
Let me first say that

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.341
probably the best model to explain
