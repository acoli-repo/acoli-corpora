00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:02.323
and you can see the very top wealth holders

00:14:02.323 --> 00:14:05.440
have been going up at six, seven percent per year

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.831
in real terms above inflation,

00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:10.203
whereas average income in the world,

00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:11.566
average wealth in the world,

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:14.949
have increased at only two percent per year.

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:16.678
And you find the same

00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:17.954

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:20.222
the bigger the initial endowments,

00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:22.290
the bigger the rate of return.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.968
Now, what could be done?

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:26.364
The first thing is that I think we need

00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:28.479
more financial transparency.

00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:32.320
We know too little about global wealth dynamics,
