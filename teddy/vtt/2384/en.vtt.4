00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:01.770
The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.267
It has more to do with changing supply and demand

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.720
for skill, the race between education and technology,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.300
globalization, probably more unequal access

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.906
to skills in the U.S.,

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:16.493
where you have very good, very top universities

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:18.735
but where the bottom part of the educational system

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.500
is not as good,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.861
so very unequal access to skills,

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.780
and also an unprecedented rise

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.800
of top managerial compensation of the United States,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.650
which is difficult to account for
just on the basis of education.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.604
So there is more going on here,
