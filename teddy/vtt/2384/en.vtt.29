00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:32.320
We know too little about global wealth dynamics,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.220
so we need international transmission

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.482
of bank information.

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:38.168
We need a global registry of financial assets,

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:40.659
more coordination on wealth taxation,

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:43.771
and even wealth tax with a small tax rate

00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:45.987
will be a way to produce information

00:14:45.987 --> 00:14:48.669
so that then we can adapt our policies

00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:50.505
to whatever we observe.

00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:52.343
And to some extent, the fight

00:14:52.343 --> 00:14:53.824
against tax havens

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:55.639
and automatic transmission of information

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.490
is pushing us in this direction.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.814
Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,

00:14:59.814 --> 00:15:02.771
which it can be tempting to use.
