00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:30.979
during the 20th century

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:32.308
was, as I said,

00:12:32.308 --> 00:12:34.624
destruction, taxation of capital,

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:37.359
so this is the pre-tax rate of return.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:40.338
This is the after-tax rate of return,

00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:41.904
and after destruction,

00:12:41.904 --> 00:12:43.681
and this is what brought

00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:45.369
the average rate of return

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:47.158
after tax, after destruction,

00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.578
below the growth rate during a long time period.

00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:51.252
But without the destruction,

00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:53.727
without the taxation, this 
would not have happened.

00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:56.970
So let me say that the balance between

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.326
returns on capital and growth

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:01.188
depends on many different factors
