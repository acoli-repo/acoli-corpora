00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:31.982
wealth holders only need to reinvest

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:34.621
one fifth of their capital income to ensure

00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:37.354
that their wealth rises as fast

00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:39.267
as the size of the economy.

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:40.650
So this makes it easier

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.416
to build and perpetuate large fortunes

00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:44.371
because you can consume four fifths,

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:46.110
assuming zero tax,

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.771
and you can just reinvest one fifth.

00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:50.359
So of course some families
will consume more than that,

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.102
some will consume less, so there will be

00:08:52.102 --> 00:08:53.857
some mobility in the distribution,

00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:56.703
but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.472
so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.
