00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:31.289
but the higher the gap between r and g,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.224
the higher the level of inequality of wealth

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:37.431
towards which society tends to converge.

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.985
So this is a key force that
I'm going to talk about today,

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:42.954
but let me say right away

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.284
that this is not the only important force

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:47.757
in the dynamics of income 
and wealth distribution,

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:49.782
and there are many other forces that play

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.763
an important role in the long-run dynamics

00:00:52.763 --> 00:00:54.338
of income and wealth distribution.

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.307
Also there is a lot of data

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.863
that still needs to be collected.

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.795
We know a little bit more today
