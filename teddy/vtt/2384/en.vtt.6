00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:01.765
during the first half of the 20th century,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.128
and in the recent decade, you can see that

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:07.630
the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.300
and this is the first fact I just talked about.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.211
Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:17.301
and here the central fact is that wealth inequality

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.907
is always a lot higher than income inequality,

00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:22.292
and also that wealth inequality,

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.945
although it has also increased in recent decades,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:26.801
is still less extreme today

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:28.680
than what it was a century ago,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.199
although the total quantity of wealth
