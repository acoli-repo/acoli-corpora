00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:30.070
the long-run growth is going to be closer

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.493
to one to two percent

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:33.439
rather than four to five percent.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:36.116
So if you look at this,

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:38.257
these are the best estimates we have

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:39.913
of world GDP growth

00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:42.272
and rate of return on capital,

00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:44.360
average rates of return on capital,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.428
so you can see that during most

00:11:45.428 --> 00:11:46.945
of the history of mankind,

00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:48.558
the growth rate was very small,

00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:50.392
much lower than the rate of return,

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.754
and then during the 20th century,

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.925
it is really the population growth,

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:57.197
very high in the postwar period,

00:11:57.197 --> 00:11:58.797
and the reconstruction process

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.370
that brought growth
