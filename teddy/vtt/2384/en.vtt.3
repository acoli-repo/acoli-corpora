00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.182
of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.960
So let me show you a couple of facts

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.105
coming from this database,

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.179
and then we'll return to r bigger than g.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.689
So fact number one is that there has been

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.740
a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.645
between the United States and Europe

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.400
over the past century.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.905
So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:54.170
much higher in Europe than in the United States,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.280
whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.946
So let me be very clear:

00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:01.770
The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.
