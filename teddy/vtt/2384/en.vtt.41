00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:31.446
so that we can all agree

00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:33.010
about this important evolution

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.337
and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.

00:20:36.337 --> 00:20:38.399
So taxation is a source of knowledge,

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:41.335
and that's what we need the most right now.

00:20:41.335 --> 00:20:43.150
BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.150
Thank you.
TP: Thank you. (Applause)
