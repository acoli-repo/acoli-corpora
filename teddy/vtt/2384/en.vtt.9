00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.347
Okay, so that's fact number one,

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:33.273
and that's very important for what follows.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.994
Wealth concentration is always

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.873
a lot higher than income concentration.

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:40.259
Fact number two is that the rise

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.206
in wealth inequality in recent decades

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:47.492
is still not enough to get us back to 1910.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:49.269
So the big difference today,

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.182
wealth inequality is still very large,

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:54.444
with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.289
but the good news is that it's actually

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.070
better than one century ago,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.441
where you had 90 percent in
Europe going to the top 10.
