00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.199
although the total quantity of wealth

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.224
relative to income has now recovered

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:34.855
from the very large shocks

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:36.880
caused by World War I, the Great Depression,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.099
World War II.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.143
So let me show you two graphs

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:43.000
illustrating fact number two and fact number three.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.390
So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.548
this is the share of total wealth

00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:53.070
going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.779
so you can see the same kind of reversal

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.344
between the U.S. and Europe that we had before

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.020
for income inequality.
