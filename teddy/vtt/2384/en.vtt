00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:02.880
It's very nice to be here tonight.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.596
So I've been working on the history of income

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.915
and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.016
and one of the interesting lessons

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.517
coming from this historical evidence

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:17.530
is indeed that, in the long run,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.250
there is a tendency for 
the rate of return of capital

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.920
to exceed the economy's growth rate,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.665
and this tends to lead to 
high concentration of wealth.

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.498
Not infinite concentration of wealth,

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:31.289
but the higher the gap between r and g,
