00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.847
and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.902
until we reach one.

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:04.514
This is an exciting discovery.

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:06.449
So exciting that mathematicians have chosen

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:08.575
to symbolize this kind of calculation,

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.345
known as a factorial,

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:12.038
with an exclamation mark.

00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:15.514
As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:17.416
is calculated as the product

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:18.876
of that same integer

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:21.836
and all smaller integers down to one.

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.263
In our simple example,

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:24.596
the number of ways four people

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.181
can be arranged into chairs

00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.052
is written as four factorial,

00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:29.975
which equals 24.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.808
So let's go back to our deck.
