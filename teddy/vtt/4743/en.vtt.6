00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.752
were written out every second

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:04.378
starting 13.8 billion years ago,

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:06.344
when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred,

00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.094
the writing would still be continuing today

00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:11.676
and for millions of years to come.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:13.426
In fact, there are more possible

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.345
ways to arrange this simple deck of cards

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.593
than there are atoms on Earth.

00:03:18.593 --> 00:03:20.759
So the next time it's your turn to shuffle,

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.093
take a moment to remember

00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:23.174
that you're holding something that

00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.235
may have never before existed

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.344
and may never exist again.
