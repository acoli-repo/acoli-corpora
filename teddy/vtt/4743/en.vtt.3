00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:31.370
you can see that each of the four initial choices

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.682
for the first chair

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:35.999
leads to three more possible choices for the second chair,

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.461
and each of those choices

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.847
leads to two more for the third chair.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:43.181
So instead of counting each final scenario individually,

00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:46.262
we can multiply the number of choices for each chair:

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.096
four times three times two times one

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:51.848
to achieve the same result of 24.

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:53.681
An interesting pattern emerges.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.729
We start with the number of objects we're arranging,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.098
four in this case,

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.847
and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers
