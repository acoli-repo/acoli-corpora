00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.808
So let's go back to our deck.

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:33.598
Just as there were four factorial ways

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:35.431
of arranging four people,

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.598
there are 52 factorial ways

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:40.014
of arranging 52 cards.

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:43.066
Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.014
Just enter the function into a calculator,

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:46.431
and it will show you that the number of

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:47.931
possible arrangements is

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.368
8.07 x 10^67,

00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:55.788
or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros.

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.458
Just how big is this number?

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.708
Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.752
were written out every second
