00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:01.466
only three people remain standing.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.262
After the second person sits down,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.219
only two people are left as candidates

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.680
for the third chair.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
And after the third person has sat down,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.431
the last person standing has no choice

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.347
but to sit in the fourth chair.

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:15.098
If we manually write out all the possible arrangements,

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:16.814
or permutations,

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.818
it turns out that there are 24 ways

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:22.180
that four people can be seated into four chairs,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.991
but when dealing with larger numbers,

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.532
this can take quite a while.

00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:27.848
So let's see if there's a quicker way.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.286
Going from the beginning again,

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:31.370
you can see that each of the four initial choices
