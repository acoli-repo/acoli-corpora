00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.848
an arrangement of cards

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:33.729
that has never before existed in all of history.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.764
How can this be?

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:37.900
The answer lies in how many different arrangements

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.348
of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible.

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:45.620
Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.035
but let's start with an even smaller one.

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:49.932
Say we have four people trying to sit

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:52.348
in four numbered chairs.

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:54.460
How many ways can they be seated?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.598
To start off, any of the four people can sit

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.920
in the first chair.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.132
One this choice is made,

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:01.466
only three people remain standing.
