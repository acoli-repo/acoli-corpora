It's called a guest worker program.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.309
And here's the even better news.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:38.542
We can replicate this success
for Central America.

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:41.434
Of course, some people

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.809
will still need to seek
asylum at the border.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:49.101
But to understand how successful

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.768
this could be for immigrants
like Juan Carlos,

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.184
understand that until recently,

00:02:55.208 --> 00:03:00.292
nearly every immigrant arrested
by Border Patrol was Mexican.
