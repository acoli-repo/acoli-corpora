00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.309
Seek asylum in another country?

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.976
They didn't want to do that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.125
They just wanted to live
in their country safely.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.809
But their options were limited.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.101
So that month,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.851
Juan Carlos moved his family
to a safer location

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.559
while he joined a group of migrants
on the long and perilous journey

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:49.434
from Central America

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:55.809
to a job a family member said
was open for him in the United States.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.393
By now we're all familiar
with what awaited them

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:00.726
at the US-Mexico border.
