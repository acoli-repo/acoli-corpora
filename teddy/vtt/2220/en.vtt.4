00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.726
But here is the good news:

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.333
We have done this before.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.226
I've been working on immigration for years

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.934
at the Cato Institute

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.434
and other think tanks in Washington DC

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:15.143
and as the senior policy adviser
for a republican member of Congress,

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.768
negotiating bipartisan immigration reform.

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.643
And I've seen firsthand

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:27.226
how America has implemented
a system of humane order at the border

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.101
for Mexico.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.458
It's called a guest worker program.
