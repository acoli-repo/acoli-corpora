By October 2018,

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.809
Juan Carlos Rivera could no longer afford

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.500
to live in his home in Copan, Honduras.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.226
As the "Dallas Morning News" reported,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.250
a gang was taking 10 percent
of his earnings from his barber shop.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.309
His wife was assaulted
going to her pre-K teaching job.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.726
And they were concerned
about the safety of their young daughter.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.559
What could they do?

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:27.851
Run away?

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.309
Seek asylum in another country?
