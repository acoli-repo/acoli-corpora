00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:03.500
One time, a snake killed
a member of his group.

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.393
Thousands of other Mexicans
also didn't make it,

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:12.684
dying of dehydration in the deserts
or drowning in the Rio Grande.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:16.250
Millions more were
chased down and arrested.

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:21.851
Guest worker visas have nearly ended
this inhumane chaos.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.434
As Vásquez Cabrera put it,

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:27.726
"I no longer have to risk my life

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.726
to support my family.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.708
And when I'm here,
I don't have to live in hiding."
