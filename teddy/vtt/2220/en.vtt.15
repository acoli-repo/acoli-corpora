00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:32.559
Central Americans could build
flourishing lives at home,

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.143
without the need to seek
asylum at the border

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:36.434
or cross illegally,

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:39.375
freeing up an overwhelmed system.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.268
Some people might say

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:45.351
that letting the workers go back and forth

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:48.101
will never work in Central America

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.875
where violence is so high.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:54.226
But again, it worked in Mexico,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.268
even as Mexico's murder rate
more than tripled over the last decade,

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:03.000
to a level higher
than much of Central America.
