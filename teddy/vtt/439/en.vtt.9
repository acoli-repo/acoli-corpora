00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:32.018
(Music ends)

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:38.458
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.851
That was a song called "East Virginia"

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.809
I learned from a man named Clifton Hicks

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.375
who lives down in Georgia.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.833
The next song ...

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.351
I have for you

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:55.643
is called "John Brown's Dream."

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.684
It's an old dance tune.

00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:01.393
And you may notice that the banjo
that I'm holding looks a little different
