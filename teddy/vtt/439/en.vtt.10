00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:01.393
And you may notice that the banjo
that I'm holding looks a little different

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.768
than banjos you might be used to seeing

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:06.934
or the one I just played, for example.

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:12.018
And this banjo
is sort of an earlier model.

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:15.268
Banjos kind of evolved like a human has.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:19.351
And I like to say that the sound
that comes out of this banjo

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:24.351
is a sound that was
just a little closer to the source,

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.684
which is Africa,

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:27.143
and some people forget that,

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:28.934
so, yeah ...

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:34.375
