00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:31.258
And when we do that,
really good things happen.

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:34.705
So, if you want to help your community,
if you want to help your family,

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:36.340
if you want to help your friends,

00:07:36.364 --> 00:07:38.385
you have to express yourself.

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.992
And to express yourself,
you have to know yourself.

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:43.333
It's actually super easy.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.193
You just have to follow your love.

00:07:46.217 --> 00:07:48.352
There is no path.

00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:51.569
There's no path till you walk it,

00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:54.226
and you have to be willing
to play the fool.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.552
So don't read the book
that you should read,

00:07:57.576 --> 00:07:59.389
read the book you want to read.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:02.796
Don't listen to the music
that you used to like.
