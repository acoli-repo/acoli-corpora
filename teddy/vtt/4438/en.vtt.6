00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.046
Beautiful.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.699
You go to Grand Canyon at sundown.

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:03.874
It's beautiful.

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:05.123
We know that's beautiful.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:06.652
But fall in love?

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:08.140
Your lover's pretty beautiful.

00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:09.851
I have four kids.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.399
Watching them play?

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.691

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.248
it's so beautiful.

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:22.411
And I believe that we are here
on this star in space

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.015
to try to help one another. Right?

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.461
And first we have to survive,

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:28.848
and then we have to thrive.

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:32.206
And to thrive, to express ourselves,
