00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:31.676
and they don't care
if they're any good or not, right?

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.687
They're not building a sandcastle going,

00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.286
"I think I'm going to be
a really good sandcastle builder."

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.218
They just throw themselves at whatever
project you put in front of them --

00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:43.015
dancing, doing a painting,

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.450
building something:

00:06:44.474 --> 00:06:45.988
any opportunity they have,

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:50.615
they try to use it to impress upon you
their individuality.

00:06:51.107 --> 00:06:52.465
It's so beautiful.

00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:56.642
It's a thing that worries me sometimes
whenever you talk about creativity,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.710
because it can have this kind of feel
that it's just nice,

00:06:59.734 --> 00:07:03.158
you know, or it's warm
or it's something pleasant.
