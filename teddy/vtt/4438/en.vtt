00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:05.365
I was hoping today to talk
a little bit about creativity.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.359
You know, a lot of people really struggle

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:09.602
to give themselves
permission to be creative.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:10.885

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.666
I mean, we're all a little suspect
of our own talent.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.670
And I remember a story

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:21.637

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.090

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.899
and I was reading --
he did a lot of interviews --

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:30.234
and one time, William F. Buckley
had this television program
