00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.613
and they eat, and they turn on
the old boob tube,

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:02.608
and somebody tries
to sell them something,

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:04.154
and I just screwed all that up.

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:06.353
I went on and I sang about Krishna,

00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:10.102
and now they're sitting in bed
and going, 'Who is this stupid poet?'

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:11.839
And they can't fall asleep, right?"

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.091

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.947
And so, I find that very liberating,

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:19.936
because I think that most of us
really want to offer the world

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.735
something of quality,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.219
something that the world
will consider good or important.

00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:28.223
And that's really the enemy,

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:32.845
because it's not up to us
whether what we do is any good,
