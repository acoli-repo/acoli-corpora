00:05:56.737 --> 00:06:00.239
He now teaches a sail camp
for children of fallen soldiers.

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:01.940
He gave his life to his passion.

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:04.505
His creativity was leadership,

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:05.708
leading others,

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.075
his bravery, to help others.

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.483
That was something he felt called to do,

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:11.634
and it gave back to him.

00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:14.215
We know this -- the time
of our life is so short,

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:15.420
and how we spend it --

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:18.817
are we spending it
doing what's important to us?

00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:20.422
Most of us not.

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.028
I mean, it's hard.

00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:24.512
The pull of habit is so huge,

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.115
and that's what makes kids
so beautifully creative,

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.087
is that they don't have any habits,

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:31.676
and they don't care
if they're any good or not, right?
