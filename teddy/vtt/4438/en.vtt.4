00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:01.270
until their father dies,

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:02.479
they go to a funeral,

00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.461
you lose a child,

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:07.139
somebody breaks your heart,
they don't love you anymore,

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:08.334
and all of a sudden,

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:12.186
you're desperate for making sense
out of this life,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.629
and, "Has anybody ever
felt this bad before?

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:17.457
How did they come out of this cloud?"

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.258
Or the inverse -- something great.

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.321
You meet somebody and your heart explodes.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:24.166
You love them so much,
you can't even see straight.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.363
You know, you're dizzy.

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:28.364
"Did anybody feel like this before?
What is happening to me?"

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.937
And that's when art's not a luxury,
it's actually sustenance.
