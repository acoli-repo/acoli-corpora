And to thrive, to express ourselves,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.113
alright, well, here's the rub:
we have to know ourselves.

00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:36.500
What do you love?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.156
And if you get close to what you love,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.892
who you are is revealed to you,

00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:42.669
and it expands.

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.416
For me, it was really easy.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.024
I did my first professional play.
I was 12 years old.

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:49.881
I was in a play called "Saint Joan"
by George Bernard Shaw

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.261
at the McCarter Theatre,

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:53.193
and -- boom! -- I was in love.

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:55.923
My world just expanded.

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:58.491
And that profession --
I'm almost 50 now --

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.293
that profession has never stopped
giving back to me,
