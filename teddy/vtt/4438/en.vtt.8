00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.293
that profession has never stopped
giving back to me,

00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:03.349
and it gives back more and more,

00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:05.966
mostly, strangely,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.943
through the characters that I've played.

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.997
I've played cops, I've played criminals,

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.645
I've played priests, I've played sinners,

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.396
and the magic of this over a lifetime,
over 30 years of doing this,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.285
is that you start to see
that my experiences,

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.685
me, Ethan, is not nearly as unique

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:25.860
as I thought.

00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:28.923
I have so much in common
with all these people.

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:31.763
And so they have something
in common with me.
