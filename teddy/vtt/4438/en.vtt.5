00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.937
And that's when art's not a luxury,
it's actually sustenance.

00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:34.151
We need it.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.299
OK. Well, what is it?

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:41.548
Human creativity
is nature manifest in us.

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:44.416
We look at the, oh ...

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:46.990
the aurora borealis. Right?

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:49.579
I did this movie called
"White Fang" when I was a kid,

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.813
and we shot up in Alaska,

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:51.991
and you go out at night

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:55.455
and the sky was like rippling
with purple and pink and white,

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.607
and it's the most beautiful
thing I ever saw.

00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.871
It really looked like the sky was playing.

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.046
Beautiful.
