00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:31.763
And so they have something
in common with me.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.506
You start to see
how connected we all are.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.255
My great-grandmother,
Della Hall Walker Green,

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.105
on her deathbed,

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.844
she wrote this little biography
in the hospital,

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.655
and it was only about 36 pages long,

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:52.034
and she spent about five pages

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.167
on the one time
she did costumes for a play.

00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:58.337
Her first husband got, like, a paragraph.

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:03.355
Cotton farming, of which
she did for 50 years, gets a mention.
