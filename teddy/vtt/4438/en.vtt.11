00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:30.437
You know? Just ...

00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.826
But completely differently.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.299
Like, I wanted to be an actor.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.210
I was like, I've got to make something
that makes people feel.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.881
I just want to be a part of that.

00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.605
And he wanted to be in the military.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.027
That's all we ever did
was play FBI, play army man,

00:05:42.027 --> 00:05:44.718
play knights, you know,
and I'd like, pose with my sword,

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:46.496
and he would build a working crossbow

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:48.509
that you could shoot an arrow into a tree.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:49.780
So he joins the army.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.430
Well, he just retired
a colonel in the Green Berets.

00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:56.713
He's a multidecorated combat veteran
of Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:05:56.737 --> 00:06:00.239
He now teaches a sail camp
for children of fallen soldiers.
