00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:30.234
and one time, William F. Buckley
had this television program

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:31.798
called "Firing Line,"

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:35.777

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.242
and they come home
and they fight with their spouse,

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.613
and they eat, and they turn on
