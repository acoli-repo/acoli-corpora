00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.840
But, if heartburn starts happening regularly,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.850
it can weaken the LES muscle over time,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.560
letting more and more acid escape.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.590
And if it goes untreated,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.330
this can cause bigger problems.


00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.280
Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.090
may form scar tissue which narrows the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.740
esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.980
Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.430
lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.000
Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate
