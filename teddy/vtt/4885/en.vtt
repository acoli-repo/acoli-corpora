Just between your chest and abdomen

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.340
is where youâ€™ll find one of the most
important muscles

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.930

the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.210
When functioning properly,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.950
this ring of tissue plays a crucial
role in helping us eat.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.950
But when the LES malfunctions,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.150
it becomes the main player in heartburn
