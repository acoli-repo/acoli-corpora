00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.410
and even chunks of food--to spurt into the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.070
esophagus, sometimes going 
as far up as the mouth.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.800
The cause of all this internal drama

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.130
has long been put down to diet.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.380
Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.430
ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.120
which makes it incapable of doing its job.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.970
Other acidic foods, 
like citrus and tomatoes,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.700
can worsen irritation of the esophagus

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.650
when they leach out with stomach acid.
