Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.440
the risk of esophageal cancer.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.790
Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.740
a range of medicines that can help

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.680
neutralize or reduce stomach acid.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.700
In extreme cases, some people have surgery

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.660
to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.750
But we can often stop heartburn

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.520
before it reaches that point.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.810
Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods,

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:27.755
not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:31.085
can all dramatically reduce reflux.
