00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.830
the muscle’s task is to stop it

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.030
from surging back up again.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.260
The LES contracts, squeezing 
the stomach entrance

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.830
and creating a high pressure zone

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.730
that prevents digestive acids 
from seeping out.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.860
But if the LES relaxes at the
wrong moment or gradually weakens,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.440
it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.570
causing the area to depressurize.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.290
That allows burning stomach acid--

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.410
and even chunks of food--to spurt into the
