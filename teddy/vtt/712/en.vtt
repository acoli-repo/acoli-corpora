00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
over the past six million years.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All right.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We all have come from a long way,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I say that not because I am African,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for human ancestors, upright walking traces,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
