00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:09.954
One day, without warning or 
apparent cause,

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:14.038
all of humanity’s artificial satellites
suddenly disappear

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:16.621
The first to understand the situation

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.829
are a handful of government
and commercial operators.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.454
But well before they have time
to process what’s happened,

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:28.246
millions sitting on their couches become
aware that something is amiss.

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:32.829
TV that’s broadcast from or routed 
through satellites dominate the market.
