WEBVTT

00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:01.470
It tells where we have been,
who we have met,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.709
and in many ways,
even what we're thinking about.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.086
And the more scary part about this is
our data now lasts forever,

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:12.093
so your data can and will outlive you.

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:15.622
What has happened is that we've largely
lost control over our data

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:17.944
and also our privacy.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.474
So this year, as the web turns 25,

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:23.772
it's very important for us
to take a moment

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:26.304
and think about the implications of this.

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:28.006
We have to really think.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:29.796
We've lost privacy, yes,

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:33.125
but actually what we've also lost
is the idea of privacy itself.
