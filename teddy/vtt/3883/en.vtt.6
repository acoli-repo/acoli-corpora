00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.074
between your computer
and the email server.

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:03.700
Then, you also encrypt the data
as it sits on the server itself.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.646
But there's a problem with this,

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:08.595
and that is, the email servers
also hold the encryption keys,

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:12.980
so now you have a really big lock
with a key placed right next to it.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.211
But not only that, any government
could lawfully ask for

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.441
and get the key to your data,

00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.064
and this is all without you
being aware of it.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:26.337
So the way we fix this problem
is actually relatively easy, in principle:

00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:28.739
You give everybody their own keys,

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.012
and then you make sure the server
doesn't actually have the keys.
