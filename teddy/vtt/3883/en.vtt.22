really from the people,

00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:05.356
from private individuals like you and I
from all over the world.

privacy depends on each
and every one of us,

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:14.777
and we have to protect it now
because our online data

00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:17.541
is more than just a collection

00:11:27.547 --> 00:11:30.651
We need to spend time now
to really protect our right
