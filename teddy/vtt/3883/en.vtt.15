00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:32.616
and it turns out Alice is the only person
that actually has this key.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:35.284
So we've now accomplished the objective,

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:37.451
which is to get the message
from Bob to Alice

00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.143
without the server being able
to read what's going on.

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.100
Actually, what I've shown here
is a highly simplified picture.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.105
The reality is much more complex

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:48.819
and it requires a lot of software
that looks a bit like this.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.259
And that's actually
the key design challenge:

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.780
How do we take all this complexity,
all this software,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.898
and implement it in a way
that the user cannot see it.

00:07:58.898 --> 00:08:02.496
I think with ProtonMail,
we have gotten pretty close to doing this.
