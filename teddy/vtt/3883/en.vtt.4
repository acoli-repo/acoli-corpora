00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.413
So, it's time for us 
to take a moment and think,

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.220
is there anything we can do about this?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.705
And I believe there is.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:10.266
Let's take a look at one of the most
widely used forms of communication

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.533
in the world today: email.

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:16.294
Before the invention of email,
we largely communicated using letters,

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.616
and the process was quite simple.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:21.728
You would first start by writing
your message on a piece of paper,

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:24.132
then you would place it
into a sealed envelope,

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.387
and from there,
you would go ahead and send it

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.345
after you put a stamp and address on it.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.825
Unfortunately, today,

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:32.642
when we actually send an email,
we're not sending a letter.
