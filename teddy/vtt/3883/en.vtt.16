I think with ProtonMail,
we have gotten pretty close to doing this.

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:04.958
So let's see how it works in practice.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.975
Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.945
who also want to communicate securely.

00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:12.132
They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,

00:08:12.132 --> 00:08:14.542
which is quite simple
and takes a few moments,

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:16.964
and all the key encryption and generation

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:19.354
is happening automatically
in the background

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.060
as Bob is creating his account.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.602
Once his account is created,
he just clicks "compose,"

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.589
and now he can write his email
like he does today.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.456
So he fills in his information,

00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:31.740
and then after that, 
all he has to do is click "send,"
