00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:06.174
Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN
created the World Wide Web.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:10.083
Since then, the Internet has transformed 
the way we communicate,

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:13.545
the way we do business,
and even the way we live.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.717
In many ways,

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:20.542
the ideas that gave birth to Google,
Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.146
have now really transformed our lives,

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:27.433
and this has brought us many real benefits
such as a more connected society.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.234
However, there are also
some downsides to this.
