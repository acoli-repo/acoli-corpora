00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.461
between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,
free of charge,

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.710
the CERN cafeteria comes with
several thousand scientists and engineers,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.496
and these guys basically know
the answers to everything.

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:11.283
So it was in this environment
that we began working.

00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:14.394
What we actually want to do
is we want to take your email

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:17.854
and turn it into something
that looks more like this,

00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:20.129
but more importantly,
we want to do it in a way

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.274
that you can't even tell
that it's happened.

00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.261
So to do this, we actually need
a combination of technology

00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:26.848
and also design.

00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:29.138
So how do we go about
doing something like this?
