00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:32.642
when we actually send an email,
we're not sending a letter.

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:35.417
What you are sending, in many ways,
is actually a postcard,

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:39.064
and it's a postcard in the sense
that everybody that sees it

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:42.699
from the time it leaves your computer
to when it gets to the recipient

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.319
can actually read the entire contents.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.778
So, the solution to this
has been known for some time,

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:50.621
and there's many attempts to do it.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.770
The most basic solution
is to use encryption,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.697
and the idea is quite simple.

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.466
First, you encrypt the connection

00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.074
between your computer
and the email server.
