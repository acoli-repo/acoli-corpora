Now, I know a question
on everybody's minds is,

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.858
okay, protecting privacy,
this is a great goal,

00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:06.298
but can you actually do this

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:09.090
without the tons of money
that advertisements give you?

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.476
And I think the answer is actually yes,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.706
because today, we've reached a point

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:17.652
where people around the world really
understand how important privacy is,

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:20.625
and when you have that,
anything is possible.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:21.789
Earlier this year,

00:09:21.789 --> 00:09:25.454
ProtonMail actually had so many users 
that we ran out of resources,

00:09:25.454 --> 00:09:28.283
and when this happened,
our community of users got together

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:30.399
and donated half a million dollars.
