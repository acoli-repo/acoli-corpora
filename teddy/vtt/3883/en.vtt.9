00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.192
which was quite complicated
and only accessible to the tech-savvy.

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:33.610
Here's a diagram that basically shows

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.345
the process for encrypting
and decrypting messages.

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:39.231
So needless to say,
this is not a solution for everybody,

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:42.363
and this actually is part of the problem,

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:44.825
because if you think about communication,

00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:49.180
by definition, it involves
having someone to communicate with.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.394
So while PGP does a great job
of what it's designed to do,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:55.215
for the people out there
who can't understand how to use it,

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.117
the option to communicate privately
simply does not exist.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.125
And this is a problem
that we need to solve.
