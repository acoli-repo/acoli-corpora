00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.125
And this is a problem
that we need to solve.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.123
So if we want to have privacy online,

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:06.442
the only way we can succeed
is if we get the whole world on board,

00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:09.693
and this is only possible
if we bring down the barrier to entry.

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:13.222
I think this is actually the key challenge
that lies in the tech community.

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:17.285
What we really have to do
is work and make privacy more accessible.

00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.281
So last summer, when
the Edward Snowden story came out,

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.896
several colleagues and I decided to see
if we could make this happen.

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:28.883
At that time, we were working at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research

00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:32.614
at the world's largest particle collider,
which collides protons, by the way.
