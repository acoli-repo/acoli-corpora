00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:01.508
we need to support a different
business model for the Internet,

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:03.841
one that does not rely
entirely on advertisements

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.175
for revenue and for growth.

00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:08.684
We actually need to build a new Internet

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:14.377
where our privacy and our ability 
to control our data is first and foremost.

00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:16.122
But even more importantly,

00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:20.990
we have to build an Internet 
where privacy is no longer just an option

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.893
but is also the default.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.493
We have done the first step
with ProtonMail,

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:30.074
but this is really just the first step
in a very, very long journey.
