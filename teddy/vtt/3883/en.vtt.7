00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.012
and then you make sure the server
doesn't actually have the keys.

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.148
This seems like common sense, right?

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:37.751
So the question that comes up is,
why hasn't this been done yet?

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.796
Well, if we really think about it,

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:43.721
we see that the business model
of the Internet today

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.788
really isn't compatible with privacy.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.574
Just take a look at some
of the biggest names on the web,

00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:51.501
and you see that advertising
plays a huge role.

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:56.329
In fact, this year alone,
advertising is 137 billion dollars,

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.500
and to optimize the ads
that are shown to us,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.633
companies have to know
everything about us.
