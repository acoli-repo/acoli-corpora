00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:32.614
at the world's largest particle collider,
which collides protons, by the way.

00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:36.059
We were all scientists,
so we used our scientific creativity

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.683
and came up with a very
creative name for our project:

00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:41.389
ProtonMail.
(Laughter)

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.257
Many startups these days
actually begin in people's garages

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:45.941
or people's basements.

00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.438
We were a bit different.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:50.081
We started out at the CERN cafeteria,

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.537
which actually is great, because look,

00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:55.010
you have all the food
and water you could ever want.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.490
But even better than this
is that every day

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.461
between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,
free of charge,
