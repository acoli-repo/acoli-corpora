00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.633
companies have to know
everything about us.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.552
They need to know where we live,

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:06.207
how old we are, what we like,
what we don't like,

00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:08.369
and anything else
they can get their hands on.

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:10.098
And if you think about it,

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:14.246
the best way to get this information
is really just to invade our privacy.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:17.437
So these companies
aren't going to give us our privacy.

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:19.252
If we want to have privacy online,

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:22.795
what we have to do is
we've got to go out and get it ourselves.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.063
For many years, when it came to email,

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:27.978
the only solution
was something known as PGP,

00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.192
which was quite complicated
and only accessible to the tech-savvy.
