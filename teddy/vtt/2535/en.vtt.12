00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.975
without having to waste any time
of driving to the site,

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.932
so whoever's there,
use their robots over the Internet.

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:05.338
Well, let's think about that.

00:06:05.362 --> 00:06:08.734
Let's think about a chemical
train derailment in a rural county.

00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:12.600
What are the odds that the experts,
your chemical engineer,

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:14.486
your railroad transportation engineers,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.371
have been trained on whatever UAV
that particular county happens to have?

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:20.928
Probably, like, none.

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:23.342
So we're using these kinds of interfaces

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:27.706
to allow people to use the robots
without knowing what robot they're using,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.516
or even if they're using a robot or not.
