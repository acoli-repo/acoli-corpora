00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:30.909
They get overlooked.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:33.335
Think about the Japanese tsunami --

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.325
400 miles of coastland totally devastated,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.045
twice the amount of coastland devastated
by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.925
You're talking about your bridges,
your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.561
And if you don't have a port,

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:50.831
you don't have a way
to get in enough relief supplies

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.076
to support a population.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.672
That was a huge problem
at the Haiti earthquake.

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.687
So we need marine vehicles.

00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.142
Now, let's look at a viewpoint
