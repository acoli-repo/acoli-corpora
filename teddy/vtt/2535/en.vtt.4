00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.561
That's where you're
pulling imagery together

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.410
and getting 3D reconstruction.

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:07.508
We used both of these at the Oso mudslides
up in Washington State,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.731
because the big problem

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.913
was geospatial and hydrological
understanding of the disaster --

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:14.183
not the search and rescue.

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:16.526
The search and rescue teams
had it under control

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.028
and knew what they were doing.

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:21.922
The bigger problem was that river
and mudslide might wipe them out

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.440
and flood the responders.

00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:27.206
And not only was it challenging
to the responders and property damage,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.509
it's also putting at risk
the future of salmon fishing
