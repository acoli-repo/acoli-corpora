00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.299
not only can we do things like
compress that sequence of phases

00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:03.976
to shorten the response time,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.358
but now we can begin
to do the response in parallel.

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:09.761
Everybody can see the data.

00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:11.247
We can shorten it that way.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:15.405
So really, "disaster robotics"
is a misnomer.

00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:18.122
It's not about the robots.

00:08:18.146 --> 00:08:20.028
It's about the data.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.763
(Applause)

00:08:23.787 --> 00:08:25.744
So my challenge to you:

00:08:25.768 --> 00:08:28.068
the next time you hear about a disaster,

00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:29.417
look for the robots.

00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:32.566
They may be underground,
they may be underwater,
