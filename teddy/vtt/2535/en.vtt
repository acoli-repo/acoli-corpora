00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.975
Over a million people are killed
each year in disasters.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:11.233
Two and a half million people
will be permanently disabled or displaced,

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:15.181
and the communities will take
20 to 30 years to recover

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.606
and billions of economic losses.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:23.425
If you can reduce
the initial response by one day,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.976
you can reduce the overall recovery

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.808
by a thousand days, or three years.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.585
See how that works?
