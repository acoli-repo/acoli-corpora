00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.842
And don't just think about the UAVs.

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:04.494
I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.854
80 percent of the world's
population lives by water,

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.742
and that means our critical
infrastructure is underwater --

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:14.052
the parts that we can't get to,
like the bridges and things like that.

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:16.668
And that's why we have
unmanned marine vehicles,

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:21.144
one type of which you've already met,
which is SARbot, a square dolphin.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.864
It goes underwater and uses sonar.

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:26.221
Well, why are marine vehicles so important

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:29.369
and why are they very, very important?

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:30.909
They get overlooked.
