00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.142
Now, let's look at a viewpoint
from the SARbot

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.637
of what they were seeing.

00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.907
We were working on a fishing port.

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:09.647
We were able to reopen that fishing port,
using her sonar, in four hours.

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.324
That fishing port was told
it was going to be six months

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.054
before they could get
a manual team of divers in,

00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:17.765
and it was going to take
the divers two weeks.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.083
They were going to miss
the fall fishing season,

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:24.333
which was the major economy for that part,
which is kind of like their Cape Cod.

00:04:24.357 --> 00:04:26.625
UMVs, very important.

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.897
But you know, all the robots
I've shown you have been small,

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.698
and that's because robots
don't do things that people do.
