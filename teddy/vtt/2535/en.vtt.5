00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.509
it's also putting at risk
the future of salmon fishing

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.249
along that part of Washington State.

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:34.749
So they needed to understand
what was going on.

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:37.382
In seven hours, going from Arlington,

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:42.220
driving from the Incident Command Post
to the site, flying the UAVs,

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.975
processing the data, driving back
to Arlington command post --

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.405
seven hours.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.963
We gave them in seven hours
data that they could take

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.737
only two to three days
to get any other way --

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:56.598
and at higher resolution.

00:02:57.064 --> 00:02:58.437
It's a game changer.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.842
And don't just think about the UAVs.
