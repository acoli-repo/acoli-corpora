or even if they're using a robot or not.

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:38.286
What the robots give you,
what they give the experts, is data.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.890
The problem becomes:
who gets what data when?

00:06:41.914 --> 00:06:45.807
One thing to do is to ship
all the information to everybody

00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.343
and let them sort it out.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:51.223
Well, the problem with that
is it overwhelms the networks,

00:06:51.247 --> 00:06:54.933
and worse yet, it overwhelms
the cognitive abilities

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:59.466
of each of the people trying to get
that one nugget of information

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.295
they need to make the decision
that's going to make the difference.
