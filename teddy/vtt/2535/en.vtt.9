don't do things that people do.

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:35.975
They go places people can't go.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.975

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.975
Unmanned ground vehicles
are particularly small,

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.317
so Bujold --

00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:44.849
(Laughter)

00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:46.056
Say hello to Bujold.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.764
(Laughter)

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:52.975
Bujold was used extensively
at the World Trade Center

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.379
to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.

00:04:55.403 --> 00:05:00.048
You're climbing into the rubble,
rappelling down, going deep in spaces.
