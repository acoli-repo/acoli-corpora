00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.295
they need to make the decision
that's going to make the difference.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.093
So we need to think
about those kinds of challenges.

00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:08.382
So it's the data.

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.642
Going back to the World Trade Center,

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:14.975
we tried to solve that problem
by just recording the data from Bujold

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.975
only when she was deep in the rubble,

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.563
because that's what the USAR team
said they wanted.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.111
What we didn't know at the time

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:25.733
was that the civil engineers
would have loved,

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:29.975
needed the data as we recorded
the box beams, the serial numbers,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.618
the locations, as we went into the rubble.
