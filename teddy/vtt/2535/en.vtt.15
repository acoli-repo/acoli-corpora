00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.618
the locations, as we went into the rubble.

00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:34.810
We lost valuable data.

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.213
So the challenge is getting all the data

00:07:37.237 --> 00:07:39.417
and getting it to the right people.

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:41.518
Now, here's another reason.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.853
We've learned that some buildings --

00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:47.149
things like schools,
hospitals, city halls --

00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:51.192
get inspected four times
by different agencies

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:53.466
throughout the response phases.

00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:57.425
Now, we're looking, if we can get
the data from the robots to share,

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.299
not only can we do things like
compress that sequence of phases
