00:04:55.403 --> 00:05:00.048
You're climbing into the rubble,
rappelling down, going deep in spaces.

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.631
And just to see the World Trade Center
from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:09.724
You're talking about a disaster
where you can't fit a person or a dog --

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:11.890
and it's on fire.

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.648
The only hope of getting
to a survivor way in the basement,

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:17.867
you have to go through things
that are on fire.

00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:22.395
It was so hot, on one of the robots,
the tracks began to melt and come off.

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:25.949
Robots don't replace people or dogs,

00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:28.494
or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:30.554
They do things new.
