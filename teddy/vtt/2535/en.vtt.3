00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.348
And they're used extensively since 2005 --

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:32.547
Hurricane Katrina.

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.895
Let me show you how this hummingbird,
this rotorcraft, works.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.975
Fantastic for structural engineers.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.419
Being able to see damage from angles you
can't get from binoculars on the ground

00:01:43.443 --> 00:01:44.753
or from a satellite image,

00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:47.969
or anything flying at a higher angle.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.902
But it's not just structural engineers
and insurance people who need this.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:55.393
You've got things
like this fixed-wing, this hawk.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:58.688
Now, this hawk can be used
for geospatial surveys.

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.561
That's where you're
pulling imagery together
