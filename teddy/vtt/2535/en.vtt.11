The biggest problem is not
making the robots smaller, though.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:42.975
It's not making them more heat-resistant.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.756
It's not making more sensors.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.390
The biggest problem is the data,
the informatics,

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:52.450
because these people need to get
the right data at the right time.

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:57.975

experts immediately access the robots

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.975
without having to waste any time
of driving to the site,
