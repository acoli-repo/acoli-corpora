00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:00.918
we ran out of electrical outlets,

00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:04.321
and I had to download
over a dozen apps to my phone

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.672
to control everything.

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:07.785
And then every device had its own log-in,

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.172
my toothbrush had a password ...

00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:11.933
(Laughter)

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:16.085
And smart coffee, especially,
was just a world of hell.

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:20.037
SM: Wait, really? Cloud-powered
coffee wasn't really working for you?

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:23.299
KH: I mean, maybe I'm naive,
but I thought it was going to be great.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.342
I thought we'd just wake up in the morning
and we'd say, "Alexa, make us coffee."

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.239
But that's not how it went down.

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:33.914
We had to use this really particular,
brand-specific phrase to make it work.
