00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.354
The devices Kashmir bought --

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:03.070
we were interested in understanding

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:05.205
what they were saying
to their manufacturers.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.291
But we were also interested
in understanding

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.685
what the home's digital
emissions look like

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.974
to the internet service provider.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.840
We were seeing what the ISP could see,
but more importantly,

00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:16.045
what they could sell.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.212
KH: We ran the experiment for two months.

00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:19.403
In that two months,

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:22.304
there wasn't a single hour
of digital silence in the house --

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:24.260
not even when we went away for a week.

00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:25.458
SM: Yeah, it's so true.

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:28.498
Based on the data, I knew when
you guys woke up and went to bed.

00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:30.561
I even knew when Kashmir
brushed her teeth.
