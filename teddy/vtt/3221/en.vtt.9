Well, as it turns out, there's a dental
insurance company called Beam.

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.934
They've been monitoring their customers'
smart toothbrushes since 2015 --

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.537
for discounts on their

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.820
KH: We know what
some of you are thinking:

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:42.498

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:43.949

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.553
It wasn't convenient, it was infuriating.

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:56.069
I'll admit, I love my smart vacuum,

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:58.498
but many other things in the house
drove me insane:

00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:00.918
we ran out of electrical outlets,
