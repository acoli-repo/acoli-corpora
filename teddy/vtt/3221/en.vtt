Kashmir Hill: So for my
birthday last year,

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.064
my husband got me an Amazon Echo.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:07.135
I was kind of shocked, actually,

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.393
because we both work
in privacy and security.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:11.753
(Laughter)

00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:16.077
And this was a device that would sit
in the middle of our home

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:17.537
with a microphone on,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.210
constantly listening.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:20.950
We're not alone, though.

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:23.855
According to a survey by NPR
and Edison Research,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.958
one in six American adults
now has a smart speaker,

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.863
which means that they have
a virtual assistant at home.
