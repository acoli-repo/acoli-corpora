00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:33.914
We had to use this really particular,
brand-specific phrase to make it work.

00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:38.546
It was, "Alexa, ask the Behmor
to run quick start."

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:42.564
And this was just, like,
really hard to remember

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:43.922
first thing in the morning,

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.649
before you have had your caffeine.

00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:46.776
(Laughter)

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.490
And apparently, it was hard to say,

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.577
because the Echo Dot
that was right next to our bed

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.212
just couldn't understand us.

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:58.325
So we would basically start every day
by screaming this phrase at the Echo Dot.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.522
(Laughter)

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:01.012
And Trevor hated this.
