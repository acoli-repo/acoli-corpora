But "Difficult People"
was all my husband, Trevor.

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:04.910
And Trevor was actually a little upset
that you knew about his binges,

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:08.268
because even though he'd been the one
to connect the TV to the router,

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.739
he forgot that the TV was watching us.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.402
It's actually not the first time
that our TV has spied on us.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:16.125
The company that made it, VIZIO,

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:20.482
paid a 2.2 million-dollar settlement
to the government just last year,

00:03:20.506 --> 00:03:23.863
because it had been collecting
second-by-second information

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.355
about what millions of people
were watching on TV, including us,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.084
and then it was selling that information
to data brokers and advertisers.
