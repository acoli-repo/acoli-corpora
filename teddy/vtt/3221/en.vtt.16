But with the internet of things, it seems,

00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:02.256
even if you pay, you're still the product.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.525
So you really have to ask:

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:05.734
Who's the true beneficiary
of your smart home,

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.387
you or the company mining you?

00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:09.363
KH: Look, we're a tech savvy crowd here.

00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:12.499
I think most of us know
that these things connect to the internet

00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:13.686
and send data out.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.728
And fine, maybe you're OK with living
in that commercial panopticon,

00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:19.149
but others aren't.

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:22.014
We need the companies to rethink
the design of these devices

00:08:22.038 --> 00:08:23.553
with our privacy in mind,

00:08:23.577 --> 00:08:26.688
because we're not all willing
to participate in "market research,"

00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:29.605
just because a device we bought
has a Wi-Fi connection.
