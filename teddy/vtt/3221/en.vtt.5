I even knew when Kashmir
brushed her teeth.

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:32.609
I'm not going to out your brushing habits,

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:36.262
but let's just say it was very clear to me
when you were working from home.

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:39.498
KH: Uh, I think you just outed them
to, like, a lot of people here.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:41.868
SM: Don't be embarrassed,
it's just metadata.

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:45.615
I knew when you turned on your TV
and how long you watched it for.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.268
Fun fact about the Hill household:

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.086
they don't watch a lot of television,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.378
but when they do,
it's usually in binge mode.

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:54.181
Favorite shows include
"Difficult People" and "Party Down."

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:56.244
KH: OK, you're right,
I loved "Party Down."

00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:58.815
It's a great show,
and you should definitely watch it.

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.283
But "Difficult People"
was all my husband, Trevor.
