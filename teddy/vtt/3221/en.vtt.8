If you buy a smart device,
you should probably know --

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:02.156
you're going to own the device,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.600
but in general, the company
is going to own your data.

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:08.196
And you know, I mean,
maybe that's to be expected --

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.727
you buy an internet-connected device,
it's going to use the internet.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.031
But it's strange to have these devices

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.713
moving into the intimate space
that is the home

00:04:16.737 --> 00:04:20.180
and allowing companies to track
our really basic behavior there.

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.363
SM: So true.

00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:24.926
Even the most banal-seeming data
can be mined by the surveillance economy.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.525
For example, who cares
how often you brush your teeth?

00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:31.075
Well, as it turns out, there's a dental
insurance company called Beam.
