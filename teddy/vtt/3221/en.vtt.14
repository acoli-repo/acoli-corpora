Some hackers took a close look at this toy

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.474
and saw it was sending
a lot of information

00:07:02.498 --> 00:07:04.960
back to the company that made it --

00:07:04.984 --> 00:07:07.950
when it was used,
how long it was used for,

00:07:07.974 --> 00:07:11.680

how hot the toy got.

00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:13.893

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.992
and I said, "Why are you collecting

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:23.755
And they said, "Well, it's great
for market research."

00:07:24.592 --> 00:07:27.521
But they were data-mining
their customers' orgasms.

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:29.466
And they weren't telling them about it.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.712
I mean, even if
you're cavalier about privacy,
