00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.696
I wanted to find out,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.108
so I went all-in and turned my
one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.481
into a smart home.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.891
I even connected our bed to the internet.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.807
As far as I know, it was just
measuring our sleeping habits.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.571
I can now tell you
that the only thing worse

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.382
than getting a terrible night's sleep

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:20.823
is to have your smart bed
tell you the next day

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.903
that you "missed your goal
and got a low sleep score."

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:25.307
(Laughter)

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:26.768
It's like, "Thanks, smart bed.

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:29.308
As if I didn't already
feel like shit today."

00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:30.485
(Laughter)
