00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:11.210
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.042
than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.891
And rather than using finite fossil fuels,

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:24.806
this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy:

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.306
running water.

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:28.813
Stretching over 2.3 kilometers,

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:33.950
China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant.
