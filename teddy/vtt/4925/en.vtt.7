00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.681
for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000.

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.759
So let’s take the numbers in the fourth 
and fifth cells

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.229
and multiply down from there.

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.749
20 and 30 each have one zero,

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.259
so the product of both cells will have 
two trailing zeros,

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.619
while the product of either cell and 
an adjacent non-zero-ending cell

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.909
will have only one.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.929
When we continue all the way down,

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.439
we end up with 35 zeros 
in the bottom cell.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.609
And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse,
