00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:32.268
through a process of multiplication –

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:33.258
literally.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:34.928
The number of rabbits in each cell

00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:38.998
is the product of the number of rabbits 
in each of the two cells above it.

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:40.507
And there are only two ways

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.737
to get numbers with trailing zeros 
through multiplication:

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:47.847
either multiplying a number ending in 5 
by any even number,

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:52.147
or by multiplying numbers that have 
trailing zeroes themselves.

00:02:52.147 --> 00:02:55.068
Let’s calculate the number of rabbits 
in the second row

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:57.288
and see what patterns emerge.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.578
Two of the numbers have trailing zeros –

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:03.248
20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell.
