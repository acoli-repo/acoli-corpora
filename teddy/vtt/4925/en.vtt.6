20 rabbits in the fourth cell 
and 30 in the fifth cell.

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.638
But there are no numbers ending in 5.

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:09.408
And since the only way to get a number 
ending in 5 through multiplication

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:11.888
is by starting with a number ending in 5,

00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:15.458
there won’t be any more 
down the line either.

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:16.988
That means we only need to worry

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.378
about the numbers that have 
trailing zeros themselves.

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:24.218
And a neat trick to figure out the amount
of trailing zeros in a product

00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:28.518
is to count and add the trailing zeros 
in each of the factors –

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.681
for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000.
