00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.760
the second has two, and so on,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.270
with eight rabbits in the last one.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.810
The other rows of cells are empty…

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.060
for now.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.100
The rabbits are hermaphroditic,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.080
and each rabbit in a given 
cell will breed once

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.820
with every rabbit in the horizontally 
adjacent cells,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.620
producing exactly one offspring each time.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.970
The newborn rabbits will 
drop into the cell

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.180
directly below the 
two cells of its parents,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.460
and within minutes will mature 
and reproduce in turn.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.385
Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits –
