00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.385
Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits –

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.095
that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros –

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:10.085
before they break free 
and overrun the world.

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:13.916
Your calculations have given you a 
46-digit number

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.426
for the count of rabbits 
in the bottom cell–

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:19.166
plenty of room to spare.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.246
But just as you pull the lever 
to start the experiment,

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:25.106
your assistant runs in with terrible news.

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:27.906
A rival lab has sabotaged your code

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:32.124
so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off.
