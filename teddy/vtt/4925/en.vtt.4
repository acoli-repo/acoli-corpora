Pause the video now if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

Answer in 1

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:13.378
There isn’t enough time to calculate the 
exact number of rabbits in the final cell.

00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:15.408
The good news is we don’t need to.

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:16.778
All we need to figure out

00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:19.948
is how many trailing zeros it has.

00:02:19.948 --> 00:02:23.218
But how can we know how many trailing 
zeros a number has

00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:25.958
without calculating the number itself?

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.988
What we do know is that we arrive at the
number of rabbits in the bottom cell

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:32.268
through a process of multiplication –
