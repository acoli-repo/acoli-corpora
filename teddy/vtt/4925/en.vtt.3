00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:32.124
so that all the zeros at the end 
of your results got cut off.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.224
That means you don’t actually know

00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:37.284
if the bottom cell will be able to hold 
all the rabbits –

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.464
and the reproduction is already underway!

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:41.834
To make matters worse,

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.174
your devices and calculators 
are all malfunctioning,

00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:49.514
so you only have a few minutes 
to work it out by hand.

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:52.048
How many trailing zeros should there be

00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:55.418
at the end of the count of rabbits 
in the bottom habitat?

00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:59.108
And do you need to pull the emergency 
shut-down lever?

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:02.068

to figure it out for yourself.
