After years of experiments,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.480
you’ve finally created 
the pets of the future–

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.930
nano-rabbits!

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.780
They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy…

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.210
and they multiply faster 
than the eye can see.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.470
In your lab there are 36 habitat cells,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.730
arranged in an inverted pyramid,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.230
with 8 cells in the top row.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.020
The first has one rabbit,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.760
the second has two, and so on,
