00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.609
And if you’re not too stressed about 
the potential nano-rabbit apocalypse,

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.501
you might notice that counting 
the zeros this way

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:06.461
forms part of Pascal’s triangle.

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:11.141
Adding those 35 zeros to the 
46 digit number we had before

00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:13.751
yields an 81 digit number –

00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.081
too big for the habitat to contain!

00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:18.831
You rush over and pull 
the emergency switch

00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:22.701
just as the seventh generation of rabbits 
was about to mature –

00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:26.058
hare-raisingly close to disaster.
