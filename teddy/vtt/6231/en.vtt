My students often ask me,
"What is sociology?"

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:09.910
And I tell them it's the study of the way
in which human beings are shaped

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.687
by things that they don't see.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.825
And they say, "So,
how can I be a sociologist?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.778
How can I understand
those invisible forces?"

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.330
And I say, "Empathy.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.454
Start with empathy.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.260
It all begins with empathy.

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:27.040
Take yourself out of your shoes,

00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:29.708
put yourself into the shoes
of another person."

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:31.362
Here, I'll give you an example.
