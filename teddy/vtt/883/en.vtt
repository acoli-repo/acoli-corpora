Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well most of my work that I work with

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is really a little bit about methodologies of working

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
rather than actually a specific discipline

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or a specific technique.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let me show you a little of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So it started over here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
