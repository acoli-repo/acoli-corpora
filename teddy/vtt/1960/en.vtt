00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:05.320
I want you to imagine two couples
in the middle of 1979

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.613
on the exact same day,
at the exact same moment,

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:10.919
each conceiving a baby, OK?

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.197
So two couples each conceiving one baby.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.487
Now I don't want you to spend too
much time imagining the conception,

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.367
because if you do,
you're not going to listen to me,

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.202
so just imagine that for a moment.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:25.400
And in this scenario,
I want to imagine that, in one case,

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.592
the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.647
meeting that X chromosome of the egg.

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.843
And in the other case,
the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,
