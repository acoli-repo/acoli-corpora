00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I will say that life involves computation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So this is a computer program.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Booted up in a cell, the program would execute,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it could result in this person;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or with a small change, it could result in this person;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or another small change, this person;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or with a larger change, this dog,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or this tree, or this whale.
