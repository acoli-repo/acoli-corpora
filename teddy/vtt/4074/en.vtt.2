to look at the sunlight.

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.779
And at the grand scale,

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:08.884
time lapse allows us to see
our planet in motion.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.700
We can view not only
the vast sweep of nature,

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.946
but the restless movement of humanity.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:20.626
Each streaking dot
represents a passenger plane,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.191
and by turning air traffic data
into time-lapse imagery,

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.536
we can see something
that's above us constantly

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.277
but invisible:

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:31.594
the vast network of air travel
over the United States.
