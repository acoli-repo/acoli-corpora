00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.541
even upside down.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.553
And by tracking markers
on an insect's wings,

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:10.247
we can visualize the air flow
that they produce.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.667
Nobody knew the secret,

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.300
but high speed shows that a dragonfly

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:17.808
can move all four wings
in different directions

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.109
at the same time.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.268
And what we learn can lead us
to new kinds of robotic flyers

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.086
that can expand our vision

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.137
of important and remote places.
