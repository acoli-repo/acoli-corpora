The silk is 100 times thinner
than human hair.

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:04.996
On there is bacteria,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.197
and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,

00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:09.351
a virus.

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.623
Inside of that, 10 times smaller,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.402
three strands of DNA.

00:05:17.743 --> 00:05:21.052
And nearing the limit
of our most powerful microscopes,

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:23.218
single carbon atoms.

00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:27.911
With the tip of a powerful microscope,

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:30.132
we can actually move atoms
