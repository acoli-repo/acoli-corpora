We think we know
most of the animal kingdom,

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.968
but there may be millions of tiny species

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:38.515
waiting to be discovered.

00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:45.755
A spider also has great secrets,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.493
because spiders' silk thread
is pound for pound stronger than steel

00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:51.000
but completely elastic.

00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:55.184
This journey will take us
all the way down to the nano world.

00:04:55.987 --> 00:05:00.101
The silk is 100 times thinner
than human hair.
