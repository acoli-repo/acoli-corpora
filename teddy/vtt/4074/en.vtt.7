00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:33.663
We're giants,

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:36.722
and we're unaware of things
that are too small for us to see.

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:41.345
The electron microscope
fires electrons which creates images

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.328
which can magnify things
by as much as a million times.

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.102
This is the egg of a butterfly.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:52.520
And there are unseen creatures
living all over your body,

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.235
including mites
that spend their entire lives

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.266
dwelling on your eyelashes,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.169
crawling over your skin at night.
