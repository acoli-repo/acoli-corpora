00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.654
it opens our minds

00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:32.975
and it touches our heart.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:36.743
So here are some scenes
from my 3D IMAX film,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.591
"Mysteries of the Unseen World."

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:41.775
(Music)

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.229
There is movement which is too slow
for our eyes to detect,

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:49.380
and time lapse makes us discover

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.766
and broaden our perspective of life.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.288
We can see how organisms emerge and grow,

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.677
how a vine survives by creeping
from the forest floor

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.284
to look at the sunlight.
