00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:30.132
we can actually move atoms

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:33.062
and begin to create amazing nano devices.

00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:39.896
Some could one day patrol our body
for all kinds of diseases

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.655
and clean out clogged arteries
along the way.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.060
Tiny chemical machines of the future

00:05:47.084 --> 00:05:49.855
can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.127
We are on the threshold
of extraordinary advances,

00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:57.539
born of our drive
to unveil the mysteries of life.
