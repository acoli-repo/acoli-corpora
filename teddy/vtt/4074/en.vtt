00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.404
What is the intersection
between technology, art and science?

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.875
Curiosity and wonder,

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.622
because it drives us to explore,

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:14.272
because we're surrounded
by things we can't see.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.036
And I love to use film
to take us on a journey

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.916
through portals of time and space,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.554
to make the invisible visible,

00:00:23.578 --> 00:00:24.940
because what that does,

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.863
it expands our horizons,

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:29.547
it transforms our perception,

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.654
it opens our minds
