but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:02.270
it's never been tapped as an idea.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.825
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:07.310
the very first step, to do real conservation,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.798
and allowing us to really explore and to understand

00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:13.589
everything related to the state of our conservation,

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.963
the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why

00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:21.554
we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on

00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:25.085
the environment surrounding the painting.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.495
Well, our vision is to rediscover

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:30.904
the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline
