for several reasons that it's not worth explaining,

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:08.672
to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:12.467
and with a 4mm camera attached to it,

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:17.256
we were successful in documenting and taking

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:22.060
some fragments of what it turns out to be

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660
a reddish color, black color, and there is some

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.057
beige fragments that later on

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:32.051
we ran a much more sophisticated exams,
