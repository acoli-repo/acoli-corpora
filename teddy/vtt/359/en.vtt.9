00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:32.051
we ran a much more sophisticated exams,

00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:37.291
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.954
so far. It seems to indicate that indeed

00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:43.010
we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.311
that no other artist has painted on that wall

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.830
before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.691
those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.306
and most likely to Leonardo.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:59.129
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.370
work of art ever achieved by mankind.
