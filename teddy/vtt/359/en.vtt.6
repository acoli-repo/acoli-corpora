00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:00.252
which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.

00:03:00.252 --> 00:03:03.845
Well, from there, unfortunately,

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.499
in 2004, the project

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.646
came to a halt. Many political reasons.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.980
So I decided to go back to my alma mater,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.652
and, at the University of California, San Diego,

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.018
and I proposed to open up a research center

00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:19.830
for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.353
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.166
for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.929
and archaeology. So students started to flow in,

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.063
and we started to build technologies, because that's
