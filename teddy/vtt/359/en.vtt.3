00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.756
and then, with thermography, we went on to discover

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.987
hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall

00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:38.565
of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.878
of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,

00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.526
all the layout of this original hall

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:48.081
the way it was before there came Vasari,

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.676
and restructured the whole thing,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.012
including a staircase that was very important

00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:58.151
in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.415
on a specific area of one of the two walls.
