00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:30.345
so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.731
like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,

00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:36.216
since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:40.723
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:45.951
just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.786
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:53.408
an air gap, and that's where

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:54.958
we believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.924
or at least the part that we know has been painted,

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:00.252
which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.
