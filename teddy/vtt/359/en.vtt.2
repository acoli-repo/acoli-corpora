00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:02.549
because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.884
came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:11.115
thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:14.354
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:17.210
the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.015
and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.895
and to find out the original doors, windows,

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:28.654
and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.756
and then, with thermography, we went on to discover
