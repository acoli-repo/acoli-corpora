00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.784
(Applause)

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:05.496
Okay? And then if we want,

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:08.276
we can continue the scroll to find out, for example,

00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:12.371
on the staircase, the whole iconography is going

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.699
to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.330
from the ruins of an old temple a new temple,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.118
and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?

00:10:21.118 --> 00:10:24.324
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:27.372
not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,

00:10:27.372 --> 00:10:29.723
the meaning of the painting,

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:32.513
and we believe this is a cool way, easy way,
