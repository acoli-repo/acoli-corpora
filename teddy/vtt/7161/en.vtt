[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:06.579
I love the universe.

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.788
The vastness, the mystery,

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.413
the astonishing beauty of the stars.

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:13.829
I love everything about it,

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:16.371
and I've devoted my life to studying it.

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.204
From atoms to galaxies,

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.079
from beginning to end.

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:23.454
But lately, I've gotten stuck
on that last bit.

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.163
The fact that the universe is dying.

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:28.621
I know this may come as a shock.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:31.038
I mean, it's the universe,
it's everything.
