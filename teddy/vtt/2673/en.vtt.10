00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.321
but by collaboration, by cryptography

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.478
and by some clever code.

00:05:04.502 --> 00:05:07.500
And because trust is native
to the technology,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.587
I call this, "The Trust Protocol."

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:13.650
Now, you're probably wondering:
How does this thing work?

00:05:13.674 --> 00:05:14.894
Fair enough.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.445
Assets -- digital assets like money
to music and everything in between --

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.135
are not stored in a central place,

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.855
but they're distributed
across a global ledger,

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.397
using the highest level of cryptography.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.588
And when a transaction is conducted,
