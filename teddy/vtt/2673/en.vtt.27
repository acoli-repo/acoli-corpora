It went directly
to her mom's mobile device

00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:32.796
without going through an intermediary.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.738
And then her mom
looked at her mobile device --

00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:39.551
it's kind of like an Uber interface,
there's Abra "tellers" moving around.

00:13:39.575 --> 00:13:42.313
She clicks on a teller
that's a five-star teller,

00:13:42.337 --> 00:13:43.722
who's seven minutes away.

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:47.346
The guy shows up at the door,
gives her Filipino pesos,

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.936
she puts them in her wallet.

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:51.121
The whole thing took minutes,

00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.008
and it cost her two percent.

00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:57.120
This is a big opportunity for prosperity.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:14:01.856
Number four: the most powerful asset
of the digital age is data.
