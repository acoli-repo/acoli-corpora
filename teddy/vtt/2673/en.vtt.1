but I believe that this is now

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.275
the next generation of the internet,

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:39.874
and that it holds vast promise
for every business, every society

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:41.565
and for all of you, individually.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:47.042
You know, for the past few decades,
we've had the internet of information.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:51.287
And when I send you an email
or a PowerPoint file or something,

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:53.385
I'm actually not sending you the original,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.772
I'm sending you a copy.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.739
And that's great.

00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:59.219
This is democratized information.
