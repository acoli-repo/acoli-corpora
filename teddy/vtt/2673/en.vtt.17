00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:30.819
and a bitstream goes through
a dozen companies,

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.206
each with their own computer system,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.535
some of them being 1970s mainframes

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.351
older than many
of the people in this room,

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.154
and three days later, a settlement occurs.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.264
Well, with a blockchain
financial industry,

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.691
there would be no settlement,

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:49.573
because the payment and the settlement
is the same activity,

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:51.341
it's just a change in the ledger.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.300
So Wall Street and all around the world,

00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:57.587
the financial industry
is in a big upheaval about this,

00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:59.762
wondering, can we be replaced,

00:08:59.786 --> 00:09:02.749
or how do we embrace
this technology for success?
