Number four: the most powerful asset
of the digital age is data.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:05.942
And data is really a new asset class,

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.245
maybe bigger than previous asset classes,

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:11.230
like land under the agrarian economy,

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:12.907
or an industrial plant,

00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.088
or even money.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.550
And all of you -- we -- create this data.

00:14:17.574 --> 00:14:19.356
We create this asset,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.095
and we leave this trail
of digital crumbs behind us

00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:23.949
as we go throughout life.

00:14:23.973 --> 00:14:26.793
And these crumbs are collected
into a mirror image of you,

00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:28.041
the virtual you.

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:31.152
And the virtual you may know
more about you than you do,
