It can take a second for an email
to go around the world,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.954
but it can take days or weeks

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:36.110
for money to move through
the banking system across a city.

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:38.333
And they take a big piece of the action --

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.387
10 to 20 percent just to send money
to another country.

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:43.663
They capture our data,

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:45.639
and that means we can't monetize it

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:48.417
or use it to better manage our lives.

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.178
Our privacy is being undermined.

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.426
And the biggest problem is that overall,

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:59.886
they've appropriated the largesse
of the digital age asymmetrically:

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.144
we have wealth creation,
but we have growing social inequality.
