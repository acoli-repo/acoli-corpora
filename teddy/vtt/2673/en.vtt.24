And it even handles reputation,

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:12.954
because if she rates a room
as a five-star room,

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:14.194
that room is there,

00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:16.445

So, the big sharing-economy
disruptors in Silicon Valley

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:23.699
could be disrupted,

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:26.337

00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:27.518
Number three:

00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:30.974
the biggest flow of funds
