00:09:57.517 --> 00:10:00.613
and then ensuring that they got
fair compensation?

00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:04.002
Let me describe five ways
that this can be done.

00:10:04.597 --> 00:10:06.023
Number one:

00:10:06.047 --> 00:10:11.276
Did you know that 70 percent
of the people in the world who have land

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.419
have a tenuous title to it?

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.255
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,
some dictator comes to power,

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.871
he says, "I know you've got a piece
of paper that says you own your farm,

00:10:20.895 --> 00:10:24.550
but the government computer
says my friend owns your farm."

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:27.145
This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:29.516
and this problem exists everywhere.
