But when it comes to assets --

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:05.568
things like money,

00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.047
financial assets like stocks and bonds,

00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.506
loyalty points, intellectual property,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.059
music, art, a vote,

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:17.587
carbon credit and other assets --

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.223
sending you a copy is a really bad idea.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.042
If I send you 100 dollars,

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.103
it's really important
that I don't still have the money --

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.134
(Laughter)

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.516
and that I can't send it to you.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.877
This has been called
the "double-spend" problem
