00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.660
for potentially billions of people.

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:03.668
Secondly:

00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.529
a lot of writers talk about Uber

00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:09.888
and Airbnb and TaskRabbit
and Lyft and so on

00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:12.208
as part of the sharing economy.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:13.896
This is a very powerful idea,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.099
that peers can come together
and create and share wealth.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.123
My view is that ...

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:23.724
these companies are not really sharing.

00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:27.855
In fact, they're successful
precisely because they don't share.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:31.051
They aggregate services together,
and they sell them.
