00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.877
This has been called
the "double-spend" problem

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.995
by cryptographers for a long time.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.738
So today, we rely entirely
on big intermediaries --

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.015
middlemen like banks, government,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.603
big social media companies,
credit card companies and so on --

00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:47.269
to establish trust in our economy.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:52.873
And these intermediaries perform
all the business and transaction logic

00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:54.293
of every kind of commerce,

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.978
from authentication,
identification of people,

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:01.067
through to clearing, settling
and record keeping.
