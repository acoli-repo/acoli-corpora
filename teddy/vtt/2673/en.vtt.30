00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.345
It only gives away
the shred of information

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:01.916
that's required to do something.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.229
A lot of transactions,

00:15:03.253 --> 00:15:05.726
the seller doesn't even need
to know who you are.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.218
They just need to know that they got paid.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.690
And then this avatar
is sweeping up all of this data

00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:15.458
and enabling you to monetize it.

00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:17.849
And this is a wonderful thing,

00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:21.064
because it can also help us
protect our privacy,

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:24.900
and privacy is the foundation
of a free society.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.890
Let's get this asset that we create

00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:28.691
back under our control,

00:15:28.715 --> 00:15:30.723
where we can own our own identity
