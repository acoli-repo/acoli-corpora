00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.035
a block gets created

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.285
that has all the transactions
from the previous 10 minutes.

00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:10.849
Then the miners get to work,
trying to solve some tough problems.

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:12.195
And they compete:

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.530
the first miner to find out the truth
and to validate the block,

00:06:16.554 --> 00:06:18.915
is rewarded in digital currency,

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.702
in the case of the Bitcoin
blockchain, with Bitcoin.

00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:24.331
And then -- this is the key part --

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.812
that block is linked to the previous block

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:28.145
and the previous block

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.417
to create a chain of blocks.
