00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.580
in the light of the most powerful
computing resource in the world

00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:01.852
that's watching me.

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:03.041
Tough to do.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.712
This is infinitely more secure

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.095
than the computer systems
that we have today.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.703
Blockchain. That's how it works.

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:13.583
So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.

00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:14.758
There are many.

00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:19.676
The Ethereum blockchain was developed
by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.930
He's [22] years old,

00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:26.172
and this blockchain
has some extraordinary capabilities.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.279
One of them is that you can
build smart contracts.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:31.271
It's kind of what it sounds like.
