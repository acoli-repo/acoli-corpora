00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.417
to create a chain of blocks.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:32.880
And every one is time-stamped,

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:35.102
kind of like with a digital waxed seal.

00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:37.781
So if I wanted to go and hack a block

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:41.640
and, say, pay you and you
with the same money,

00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:43.917
I'd have to hack that block,

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.371
plus all the preceding blocks,

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:48.789
the entire history of commerce
on that blockchain,

00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:52.304
not just on one computer
but across millions of computers,

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.107
simultaneously,

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:57.466
all using the highest
levels of encryption,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.580
in the light of the most powerful
computing resource in the world
