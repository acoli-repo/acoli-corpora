00:03:55.665 --> 00:04:00.116
And my thoughts are inspired
by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.382
who said,

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:03.851
"Architects do not design walls,

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.999
but the spaces between them."

00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:09.459
So while I do not think that architects
should be designing walls,

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:13.205
I do think it's important and urgent
that they should be paying attention

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.976
to those spaces in between.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.785
They should be designing for the places
and the people, the landscapes

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.261
that the wall endangers.

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:25.419
Now, people are already
rising to this occasion,

00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:30.323
and while the purpose of the wall
is to keep people apart and away,
