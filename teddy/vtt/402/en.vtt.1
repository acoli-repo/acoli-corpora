00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.165
And those lines drawn on a map

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.636
can actually create
scars in the landscape,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.981
and they can create scars in our memories.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.551
My interest in borders came about

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:42.081
when I was searching
for an architecture of the borderlands.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.577
And I was working on several projects
along the US-Mexico border,

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:51.125
designing buildings made out of mud
taken right from the ground.

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:55.484
And I also work on projects that you
might say immigrated to this landscape.

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:57.833
"Prada Marfa," a land-art sculpture

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.857
that crosses the border
between art and architecture,
