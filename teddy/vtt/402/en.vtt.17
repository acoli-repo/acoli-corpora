But the poem is really about questioning
the need for building walls at all.

00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.797
It's really a poem about mending
human relationships.

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:37.790
My favorite line is the first one:

00:08:37.814 --> 00:08:40.083
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall."

00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:43.741
Because if there's one thing
that's clear to me --

00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:46.412
there are not two sides defined by a wall.

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:48.367
This is one landscape, divided.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.060
On one side, it might look like this.

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:55.016
A man is mowing his lawn
while the wall is looming in his backyard.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.640
And on the other side,
it might look like this.

00:08:57.664 --> 00:09:00.877
The wall is the fourth wall
of someone's house.
