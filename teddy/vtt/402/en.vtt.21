00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.607
in thinking about using
a little girl with pigtails, for example,

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:34.909
because he thought that's who motorists
might empathize with the most,

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:39.419
and he used the silhouette
of the civil rights leader Cesar Chavez

00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:41.321
to create the head of the father.

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.516
I wanted to build upon
the brilliance of this sign

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.929
to call attention to the problem
of child separation at the border,

00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:50.810
and I made one very simple move.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:53.119
I turned the families to face each other.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:54.844
And in the last few weeks,

00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:57.956
I've had the opportunity
to bring that sign back to the highway

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.749
to tell a story,

00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:03.496
the story of the relationships
that we should be mending
