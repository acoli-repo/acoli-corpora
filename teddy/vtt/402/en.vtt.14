00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.498
food and conversation across the divide.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:05.074
A swing allows one to enter
and swing over to the other side

00:07:05.098 --> 00:07:07.854
until gravity deports them back
to their own country.

00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:11.342
The border and the border wall

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:15.595
is thought of as a sort of
political theater today,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.983
so perhaps we should invite
audiences to that theater,

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:22.674
to a binational theater
where people can come together

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:25.967
with performers, musicians.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.947
Maybe the wall is nothing more
than an enormous instrument,

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:33.677
the world's largest xylophone,
and we could play down this wall
