00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.654
I began to document my thoughts
and visits to the wall

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.227
by creating a series of souvenirs

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:40.910
to remind us of the time
when we built a wall

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.068
and what a crazy idea that was.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:45.858
I created border games,

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.405
(Laughter)

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.707
postcards,

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.945
snow globes with little architectural
models inside of them,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:58.937
and maps that told the story
of resilience at the wall

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:03.636
and sought for ways that design
could bring to light the problems
