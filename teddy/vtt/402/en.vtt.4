00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:03.636
and sought for ways that design
could bring to light the problems

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.516
that the border wall was creating.

00:02:06.777 --> 00:02:09.325
So, is the wall architecture?

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.626
Well, it certainly is a design structure,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.332
and it's designed at a research
facility called FenceLab,

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.364
where they would load vehicles
with 10,000 pounds

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.547
and ram them into the wall
at 40 miles an hour

00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:22.642
to test the wall's impermeability.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.924
But there was also counter-research
going on on the other side,

00:02:25.948 --> 00:02:28.218
the design of portable drawbridges

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:30.243
that you could bring right up to the wall
