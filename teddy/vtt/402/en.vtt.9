and while the purpose of the wall
is to keep people apart and away,

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:34.180
it's actually bringing people together
in some really remarkable ways,

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:37.625
holding social events like
binational yoga classes along the border,

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:40.362
to bring people together
across the divide.

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:42.167
I call this the monument pose.

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.426
(Laughter)

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:47.642

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.070

00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:54.958
It's a borderland version of volleyball,
and it's been played since 1979

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:56.396
(Laughter)

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.952
along the US-Mexico border

00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:00.418
to celebrate binational heritage.
