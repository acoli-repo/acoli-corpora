00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.966
A Border Patrol agent buys
a raspado, a frozen treat,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.641
from a vendor just a couple feet away,

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:37.235
food and money is exchanged
through the wall,

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:43.212
an entirely normal event
made illegal by that line drawn on a map

00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:46.213
and a couple millimeters of steel.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.054
And this scene reminded me of a saying:

00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:53.046
"If you have more than you need,
you should build longer tables

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.922
and not higher walls."

00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:58.451
So I created this souvenir to remember
the moment that we could share

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.498
food and conversation across the divide.
