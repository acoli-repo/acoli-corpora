00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:01.021
is by imagining a teeter-totter,

00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:04.606
where the actions on one side
had a direct consequence

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.853
on what happens on the other side,

00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:08.890
because you see, the border itself

00:08:08.914 --> 00:08:13.157
is both a symbolic and literal fulcrum
for US-Mexico relations,

00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:16.831
and building walls between neighbors
severs those relationships.

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:22.222
You probably remember this quote,
"Good fences make good neighbors."

00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:25.872
It's often thought of as the moral
of Robert Frost's poem "Mending Wall."

00:08:27.316 --> 00:08:31.451
But the poem is really about questioning
the need for building walls at all.
