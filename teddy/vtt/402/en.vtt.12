is to erect baseball backstops
to protect themselves and their vehicles.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.948

in the construction of new walls.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.329
And I began to wonder if, like volleyball,

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:14.558
maybe baseball should be
a permanent feature at the border,

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.912
and walls could start opening up,

allowing communities
to come across and play,

00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:21.631
and if they hit a home run,

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:24.635

pick up the ball and throw it

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:25.994

00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.966
A Border Patrol agent buys
