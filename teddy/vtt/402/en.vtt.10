00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:00.418
to celebrate binational heritage.

00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:02.860
And it raises some
interesting questions, right?

00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:04.995
Is such a game even legal?

00:05:06.017 --> 00:05:09.700
Does hitting a ball back and forth
over the wall constitute illegal trade?

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:11.951
(Laughter)

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:16.898
The beauty of volleyball
is that it transforms the wall

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:19.286
into nothing more than a line in the sand

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.453
negotiated by the minds and bodies
and spirits of players on both sides.

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:28.641
And I think it's exactly
these kinds of two-sided negotiations

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:31.842
that are needed to bring down
walls that divide.
