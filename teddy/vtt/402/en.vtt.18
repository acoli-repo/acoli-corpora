00:08:57.664 --> 00:09:00.877
The wall is the fourth wall
of someone's house.

00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:05.029
But the reality is that the wall
is cutting through people's lives.

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:09.227
It is cutting through
our private property,

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:10.402
our public lands,

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.441
our Native American lands, our cities,

00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:14.424
a university,

00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:16.392
our neighborhoods.

00:09:17.077 --> 00:09:18.905
And I couldn't help but wonder

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:21.635
what it would be like if the wall
cut through a house.

00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:25.366
Remember those disparities
between wealth and poverty?

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.327
On the right is the average size
of a house in El Paso, Texas,

00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.184
and on the left is the average size
of a house in Juarez.
