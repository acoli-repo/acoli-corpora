00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.380
where people publicly post pictures
of their most intimate spaces,

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:03.261
their bedrooms, the bathrooms --

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.711
the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed
when people come over.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.406
And then, over the Internet,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.863
they're going to invite complete strangers
to come sleep in their homes.

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:13.292
It's going to be huge!"

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.482
(Laughter)

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.763
We sat back, and we waited
for the rocket ship to blast off.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.098
It did not.

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.506
No one in their right minds
would invest in a service

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.102
that allows strangers
to sleep in people's homes.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.278
Why?

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.220
Because we've all been taught
as kids, strangers equal danger.
