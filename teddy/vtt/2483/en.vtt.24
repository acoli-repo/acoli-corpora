They don't want you to feel lonely,
they bring you books to read.

00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:04.605
And they let you stay at their house
extra nights without charging you.

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:05.859
Highly recommended!"

00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:08.336
(Applause)

00:12:14.342 --> 00:12:16.591
Of course, not every stay is like that.

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:19.787
But this connection beyond the transaction

00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.572
is exactly what the sharing
economy is aiming for.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.809
Now, when I heard that term,

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.759
I have to admit, it tripped me up.

00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:31.306
How do sharing
and transactions go together?
