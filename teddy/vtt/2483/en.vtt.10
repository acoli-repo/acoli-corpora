Is it possible to design for trust?

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.802
I want to give you a sense
of the flavor of trust

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.682
that we were aiming to achieve.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.122
I've got a 30-second experiment

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:13.594
that will push you past your comfort zone.

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:15.879
If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.654
OK, I need you to take out your phones.

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:28.366
Now that you have your phone out,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.119
I'd like you to unlock your phone.
