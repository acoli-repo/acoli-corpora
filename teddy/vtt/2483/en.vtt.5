00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:30.051
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:33.349
my roommate moves out,
and then the rent goes up.

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:37.051
And then I learn there's a design
conference coming to town,

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.866
and all the hotels are sold out.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.370
And I've always believed
that turning fear into fun

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.902
is the gift of creativity.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:50.060
So here's what I pitch my best friend
and my new roommate Brian Chesky:

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:52.384
"Brian, thought of a way
to make a few bucks --

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:54.891
turning our place into 'designers
bed and breakfast,'

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:57.694
offering young designers who come
to town a place to crash,

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.165
complete with wireless Internet,
a small desk space,
