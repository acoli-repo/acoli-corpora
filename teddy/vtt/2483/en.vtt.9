00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.220
Because we've all been taught
as kids, strangers equal danger.

00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:37.585
Now, when you're faced with a problem,
you fall back on what you know,

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.379
and all we really knew was design.

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.212
In art school, you learn
that design is much more

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:46.449
than the look and feel of something --
it's the whole experience.

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:48.532
We learned to do that for objects,

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:52.840
but here, we were aiming
to build Olympic trust

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:54.674
between people who had never met.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.242
Could design make that happen?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.697
Is it possible to design for trust?
