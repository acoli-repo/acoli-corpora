00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.250
is hanging in his classroom;
he's a teacher now.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:04.812
This was my first hosting experience,

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:07.720
and it completely changed my perspective.

00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:13.960
Maybe the people that my childhood
taught me to label as strangers

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:16.440
were actually friends waiting
to be discovered.

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:21.487
The idea of hosting people on airbeds
gradually became natural to me

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.170
and when I moved to San Francisco,

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:24.789
I brought the airbed with me.

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:26.742
So now it's two years later.

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:30.051
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,
