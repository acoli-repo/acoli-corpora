What if we changed one small thing

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:04.338
about the design of that experiment?

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:08.145
What if your neighbor had introduced
themselves first, with their name,

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.034
where they're from, the name
of their kids or their dog?

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:15.217
Imagine that they had 150 reviews
of people saying,

00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:17.646
"They're great at holding
unlocked phones!"

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.527
(Laughter)

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.906
Now how would you feel
about handing your phone over?

00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:28.936
It turns out,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.412
a well-designed reputation system
is key for building trust.
