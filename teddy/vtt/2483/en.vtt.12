Because the only thing
more personal than your phone

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:02.561
is your home.

00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.890
People don't just see your messages,

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:06.173
they see your bedroom,

00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:07.787
your kitchen, your toilet.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.481
Now, how does it feel holding
someone's unlocked phone?

00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:15.933
Most of us feel really responsible.

00:06:17.017 --> 00:06:20.818
That's how most guests feel
when they stay in a home.

00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:23.785
And it's because of this
that our company can even exist.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.094
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?

00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:30.576
