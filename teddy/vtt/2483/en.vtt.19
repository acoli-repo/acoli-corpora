00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.256
We bet our whole company

00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:33.789
on the hope that,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:35.696
with the right design,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.989
people would be willing to overcome
the stranger-danger bias.

00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:41.300
What we didn't realize

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:43.758
is just how many people

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:46.157
were ready and waiting
to put the bias aside.

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:50.574
This is a graph that shows
our rate of adoption.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.455
There's three things happening here.

00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.796
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:00.961
The second is the efforts of our team.
