00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.165
complete with wireless Internet,
a small desk space,

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.205
sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.074
We built a basic website

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.945
Three lucky guests got to stay

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.437

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:28.436

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.943
the door latch clicked,
