What if homes were designed
to be shared from the ground up?

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:35.787
What would that look like?

00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:40.401
What if cities embraced
a culture of sharing?

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:46.510
I see a future of shared cities
that bring us community and connection

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.745
instead of isolation and separation.

00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:51.859
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,

00:13:51.883 --> 00:13:53.566
they've actually even started this.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.466
They've repurposed hundreds
of government parking spots

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.934
to be shared by residents.

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:01.463
They're connecting students
who need a place to live
