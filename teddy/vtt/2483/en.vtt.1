00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:30.469
before he goes into the Peace Corps.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.496
So I invite him out for a beer

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:35.623
and he tells me all about his passion

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:37.695
for making a difference in the world.

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.086
Now it's starting to get late,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.067
and I'm getting pretty tired.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.404
As I motion for the tab,

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:46.575
I make the mistake of asking him,

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:49.281
"So where are you staying tonight?"

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.114
And he makes it worse by saying,

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:54.718
"Actually, I don't have a place."

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.982
And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.212
What do you do?
