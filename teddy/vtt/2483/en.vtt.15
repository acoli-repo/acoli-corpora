a well-designed reputation system
is key for building trust.

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.961
And we didn't actually
get it right the first time.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:38.730
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:43.833
Eventually, we learned to wait
until both guests and hosts

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:45.961
left the review before we reveal them.

00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:50.199
Now, here's a discovery
we made just last week.

00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:52.888
We did a joint study with Stanford,

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:55.906
where we looked at people's
willingness to trust someone

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.396
based on how similar they are in age,
location and geography.
