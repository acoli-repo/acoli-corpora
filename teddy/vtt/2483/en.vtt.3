00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.515
That night, I'm laying in bed,

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.746
I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,

00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.477
"Oh my god, what have I done?

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.656
There's a complete stranger
sleeping in my living room.

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.315
What if he's psychotic?"

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.329
My anxiety grows so much,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.213
I leap out of bed,

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:48.930
I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,

00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:50.779
and I lock the bedroom door.

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:54.168
It turns out he was not psychotic.

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:56.423
We've kept in touch ever since.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.737
And the piece of art
he bought at the yard sale

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.250
is hanging in his classroom;
he's a teacher now.
