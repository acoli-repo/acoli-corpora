Anne Milgram: Congressman,
I was about to introduce you

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:04.825
and say a little more --

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:06.470
Will Hurd: Hey, Anne. How are you?

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.698
AM: Hi, how are you doing?
Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:12.068
We're so lucky to have you here with us.

00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:14.810
I've already explained
that you're actually in Washington

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.041
because you're working.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:17.501
And I was about to tell folks

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.575
that you represent
the 23rd district of Texas.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.809
But maybe you could tell us
a little bit about your district

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.367
and describe it for us.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:33.482
WH: Sure, my district in Southwest Texas
is 29 counties, two time zones,
