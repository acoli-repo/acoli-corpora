00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.736
But despite high hopes, the LHC
revealed a barren subatomic wilderness

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.440
populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.016
My experiment published paper after paper

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.520
where we glumly had to conclude
that we saw no signs of new physics.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.056
The stakes now could not be higher.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.976
This summer, the LHC began
its second phase of operation

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.256
with an energy almost double
what we achieved in the first run.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.936
What particle physicists
are all desperately hoping for

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.736
are signs of new particles,
micro black holes,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.856
or maybe something totally unexpected
