I'm not going to go
into the details of these ideas now,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.336
but the key point is this:

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.216
if any of them explained this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.976
then we should see new particles
being created at the LHC

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.976
along with the Higgs boson.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.960
So far, though, we've not seen
any sign of them.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.016
But there's actually an even worse example

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.416
of this kind of fine-tuning
of a dangerous number,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.056
and this time it comes
from the other end of the scale,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.936
from studying the universe
at vast distances.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.296
One of the most important consequences
of Einstein's general theory of relativity
