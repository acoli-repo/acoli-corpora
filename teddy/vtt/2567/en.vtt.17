00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.216
It's been estimated, in fact,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.176
that there are 10 to the 500
different versions of string theory.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.576
Each one would describe
a different universe

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.736
with different laws of physics.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.376
Now, critics say this makes
string theory unscientific.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.336
You can't disprove the theory.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360
But others actually
turned this on its head

00:08:45.384 --> 00:08:47.656
and said, well,
maybe this apparent failure

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.016
is string theory's greatest triumph.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.416
What if all of these 10 to the 500
different possible universes

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.656
actually exist out there somewhere

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.800
in some grand multiverse?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.136
Suddenly we can understand
