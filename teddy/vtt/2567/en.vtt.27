What they're really planning to do
is to build a machine

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.336
that will study the Higgs boson in detail
and could give us some clues

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.296
as to whether these new ideas,
like supersymmetry, are really out there,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.225
so it's great news for physics, I think.

00:13:39.249 --> 00:13:41.425
BG: Harry, thank you.
HC: Thank you very much.

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:44.640
