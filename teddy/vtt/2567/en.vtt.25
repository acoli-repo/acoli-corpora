00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.136
and you start planning the machine
without the technology

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.576
that you know you're going to need
to be able to build it.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.136
So the computing power
did not exist in the early '90s

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.780
when design work began in earnest.

00:12:36.804 --> 00:12:39.020
One of the big detectors
which record these collisions,

00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:40.896
they didn't think there was technology

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.776
that could withstand the radiation
that would be created in the LHC,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.536
so there was basically a lump of lead
in the middle of this object

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.136
with some detectors around the outside,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.056
but subsequently
we have developed technology.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.416
So you have to rely on people's ingenuity,
that they will solve the problems,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.296
but it may be a decade
or more down the line.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.536
BG: China just announced
two or three weeks ago

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.016
that they intend to build

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.016
a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.
