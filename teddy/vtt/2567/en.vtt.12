00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.720
driven by a mysterious repulsive force
called dark energy.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.696
Now, whenever you hear
the word "dark" in physics,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.216
you should get very suspicious

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.296
because it probably means
we don't know what we're talking about.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.336
(Laughter)

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.376
We don't know what dark energy is,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.136
but the best idea is that it's the energy
of empty space itself,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.376
the energy of the vacuum.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.936
Now, if you use good old
quantum mechanics to work out

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.576
how strong dark energy should be,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.816
you get an absolutely astonishing result.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.696
You find that dark energy

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.696
should be 10 to the power
of 120 times stronger
