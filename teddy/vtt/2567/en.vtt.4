00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.040
Why is there something
rather than nothing?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.576
This contradiction is the most pressing
problem in fundamental physics,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.320
and in the next few years, we may find out
whether we'll ever be able to solve it.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.176
At the heart of this problem
are two numbers,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.696
two extremely dangerous numbers.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.416
These are properties of the universe
that we can measure,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.976
and they're extremely dangerous

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.416
because if they were different,
even by a tiny bit,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.160
then the universe as we know it
would not exist.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.176
The first of these numbers is associated
with the discovery that was made
