1915 must have been an exciting year
to be a physicist.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.336
Two new ideas were turning
the subject on its head.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.696
One was Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.896
the other was arguably
even more revolutionary:

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.376
quantum mechanics,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.936
a mind-meltingly strange
yet stunningly successful new way

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.240
of understanding the microworld,
the world of atoms and particles.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.576
Over the last century,
these two ideas have utterly transformed

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.336
our understanding of the universe.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.696
It's thanks to relativity
and quantum mechanics

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.056
that we've learned
what the universe is made from,
