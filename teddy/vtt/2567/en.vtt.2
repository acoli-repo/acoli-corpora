00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.056
that we've learned
what the universe is made from,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.599
how it began
and how it continues to evolve.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.656
A hundred years on, we now find ourselves
at another turning point in physics,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.160
but what's at stake now
is rather different.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.296
The next few years may tell us
whether we'll be able

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.176
to continue to increase
our understanding of nature,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.616
or whether maybe for the first time
in the history of science,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.576
we could be facing questions
that we cannot answer,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.176
not because we don't have
the brains or technology,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.440
but because the laws of physics
themselves forbid it.
