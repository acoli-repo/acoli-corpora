00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.216
and the essential idea is,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.736
if you could zoom in on the fundamental
particles that make up our world,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.416
you'd see actually
that they're not particles at all,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.056
but tiny vibrating strings of energy,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.416
with each frequency of vibration
corresponding to a different particle,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.000
a bit like musical notes
on a guitar string.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.056
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic
way of looking at the world,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.536
but it has one catastrophic problem.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.456
It turns out that string theory
isn't one theory at all,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.776
but a whole collection of theories.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.216
It's been estimated, in fact,
