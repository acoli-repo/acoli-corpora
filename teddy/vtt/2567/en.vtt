00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.176
A hundred years ago this month,
a 36-year-old Albert Einstein

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.456
stood up in front of the Prussian
Academy of Sciences in Berlin

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.936
to present a radical new theory
of space, time and gravity:

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.976
the general theory of relativity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.056
General relativity is unquestionably
Einstein's masterpiece,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.056
a theory which reveals the workings
of the universe at the grandest scales,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.456
capturing in one beautiful line of algebra

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.000
everything from why apples fall from trees
to the beginning of time and space.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.816
1915 must have been an exciting year
to be a physicist.
