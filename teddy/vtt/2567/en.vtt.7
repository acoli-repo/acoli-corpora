00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.418
then you've felt the effect of a field.

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:34.816
And the Higgs field
is a little bit like a magnetic field,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.656
except it has a constant value everywhere.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.136
It's all around us right now.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.896
We can't see it or touch it,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.136
but if it wasn't there,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.600
we would not exist.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.976
The Higgs field gives mass

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.376
to the fundamental particles
that we're made from.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.016
If it wasn't there, those particles
would have no mass,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.720
and no atoms could form
and there would be no us.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.336
But there is something deeply mysterious
about the Higgs field.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.056
Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us
that it has two natural settings,
