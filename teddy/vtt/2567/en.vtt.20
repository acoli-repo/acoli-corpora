00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.496
so why not other universes?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.880
The problem is, it's unlikely
we'll ever know for sure.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.056
Now, the idea of the multiverse
has been around for a while,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.336
but in the last few years,
we've started to get the first solid hints

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.120
that this line of reasoning
may get born out.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.656
Despite high hopes
for the first run of the LHC,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.252
what we were looking for there --

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.336
we were looking
for new theories of physics:

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.256
supersymmetry or large extra dimensions

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.496
that could explain this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.736
But despite high hopes, the LHC
revealed a barren subatomic wilderness
