00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.840
a bit like a light switch that's got stuck
just before the off position.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.096
And this value is crucial.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.976
If it were a tiny bit different,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.656
then there would be
no physical structure in the universe.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.856
So this is the first
of our dangerous numbers,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.936
the strength of the Higgs field.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.696
Theorists have spent decades
trying to understand

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.376
why it has this very peculiarly
fine-tuned number,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.216
and they've come up
with a number of possible explanations.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.176
They have sexy-sounding names
like "supersymmetry"

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.136
or "large extra dimensions."

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.936
I'm not going to go
into the details of these ideas now,
