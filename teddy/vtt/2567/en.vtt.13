00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.696
should be 10 to the power
of 120 times stronger

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.536
than the value we observe from astronomy.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.376
That's one with 120 zeroes after it.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.976
This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.216
that it's impossible
to get your head around.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.736
We often use the word "astronomical"
when we're talking about big numbers.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.416
Well, even that one won't do here.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.856
This number is bigger
than any number in astronomy.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.976
It's a thousand trillion
trillion trillion times bigger

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.640
than the number of atoms
in the entire universe.
