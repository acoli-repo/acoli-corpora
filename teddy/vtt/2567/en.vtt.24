00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.056
building something like the LHC
is a generational project.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.376
I just mentioned, introducing you,
that we live in a short-term world.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.256
How do you think so long term,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.616
projecting yourself out a generation
when building something like this?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.056
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.896
that I joined the experiment
I work on at the LHC in 2008,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.301
just as we were switching on,

00:12:18.325 --> 00:12:21.576
and there are people in my research group
who have been working on it

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.216
for three decades,
their entire careers on one machine.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.416
So I think the first conversations
about the LHC were in 1976,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.136
and you start planning the machine
without the technology
