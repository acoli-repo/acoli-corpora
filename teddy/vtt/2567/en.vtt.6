00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.760
being created at the violent collisions
at the LHC: the Higgs boson.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.496
Now, if you followed the news at the time,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.576
you'll have seen a lot of physicists
getting very excited indeed,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.256
and you'd be forgiven for thinking

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.816
we get that way every time
we discover a new particle.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.176
Well, that is kind of true,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.896
but the Higgs boson
is particularly special.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.376
We all got so excited
because finding the Higgs

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.736
proves the existence
of a cosmic energy field.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.376
Now, you may have trouble
imagining an energy field,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.829
but we've all experienced one.

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.389
If you've ever held a magnet
close to a piece of metal

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:29.536
and felt a force pulling across that gap,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.418
then you've felt the effect of a field.
