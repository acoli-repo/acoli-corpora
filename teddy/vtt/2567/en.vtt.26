00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.016
a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.656
I was wondering how you
and your colleagues welcome the news.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.416
HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.
BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.216
(Laughter)

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.336
It sounds funny for a particle
physicist to say that.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.696
But I mean, seriously, it's great news.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.216
So building a machine like the LHC

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.016
requires countries from all over the world
to pool their resources.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.376
No one nation can afford
to build a machine this large,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.616
apart from maybe China,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.856
because they can mobilize
huge amounts of resources,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.936
manpower and money
to build machines like this.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.216
So it's only a good thing.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.576
What they're really planning to do
is to build a machine
