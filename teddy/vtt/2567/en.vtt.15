00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.440
But unlike the Higgs field,
this number has no known explanation.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.456
The hope was that a complete combination

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.696
of Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.296
which is the theory
of the universe at grand scales,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.776
with quantum mechanics, the theory
of the universe at small scales,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.656
might provide a solution.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.136
Einstein himself
spent most of his later years

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.336
on a futile search
for a unified theory of physics,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.736
and physicists have kept at it ever since.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.896
One of the most promising candidates
for a unified theory is string theory,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.216
and the essential idea is,
