Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us
that it has two natural settings,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.736
a bit like a light switch.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.136
It should either be off,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.816
so that it has a zero value
everywhere in space,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.200
or it should be on so it has
an absolutely enormous value.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.576
In both of these scenarios,
atoms could not exist,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.736
and therefore all the other
interesting stuff

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.399
that we see around us
in the universe would not exist.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.616
In reality, the Higgs field
is just slightly on,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.696
not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker
than its fully on value,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.840
a bit like a light switch that's got stuck
just before the off position.
