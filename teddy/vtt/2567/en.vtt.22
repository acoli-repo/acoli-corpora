00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.856
or maybe something totally unexpected

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.496
emerging from the violent collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.856
If so, then we can continue
this long journey

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.456
that began 100 years ago
with Albert Einstein

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.000
towards an ever deeper understanding
of the laws of nature.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.776
But if, in two or three years' time,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.136
when the LHC switches off again
for a second long shutdown,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.456
we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.296
then we may be entering
a new era in physics:

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.096
an era where there are weird features
of the universe that we cannot explain;
