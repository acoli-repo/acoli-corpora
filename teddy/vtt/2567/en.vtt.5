00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.176
The first of these numbers is associated
with the discovery that was made

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.176
a few kilometers from this hall,
at CERN, home of this machine,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.256
the largest scientific device
ever built by the human race,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.136
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.136
The LHC whizzes subatomic particles
around a 27-kilometer ring,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.616
getting them closer and closer
to the speed of light

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.296
before smashing them into each other
inside gigantic particle detectors.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.816
On July 4, 2012, physicists
at CERN announced to the world

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.376
that they'd spotted
a new fundamental particle

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.760
being created at the violent collisions
at the LHC: the Higgs boson.
