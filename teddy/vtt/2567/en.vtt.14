00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.256
So that's a pretty bad prediction.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.995
In fact, it's been called
the worst prediction in physics,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.296
and this is more than just
a theoretical curiosity.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.056
If dark energy were
anywhere near this strong,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.216
then the universe
would have been torn apart,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.560
stars and galaxies could not form,
and we would not be here.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.576
So this is the second
of those dangerous numbers,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.976
the strength of dark energy,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.936
and explaining it requires an even more
fantastic level of fine-tuning

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.484
than we saw for the Higgs field.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.440
But unlike the Higgs field,
this number has no known explanation.
