00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.440
but because the laws of physics
themselves forbid it.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.136
This is the essential problem:
the universe is far, far too interesting.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.816
Relativity and quantum mechanics
appear to suggest

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.136
that the universe
should be a boring place.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.056
It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.016
But when we look around us, we see we live
in a universe full of interesting stuff,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.096
full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.616
The question is, ultimately,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.936
why does all this interesting stuff exist?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.040
Why is there something
rather than nothing?
