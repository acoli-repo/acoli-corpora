00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.296
One of the most important consequences
of Einstein's general theory of relativity

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.736
was the discovery that the universe began
as a rapid expansion of space and time

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.536
13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.216
Now, according to early versions
of the Big Bang theory,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.416
the universe has been expanding ever since

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.496
with gravity gradually putting
the brakes on that expansion.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.856
But in 1998, astronomers made
the stunning discovery

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.696
that the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.856
The universe is getting
bigger and bigger faster and faster

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.720
driven by a mysterious repulsive force
called dark energy.
