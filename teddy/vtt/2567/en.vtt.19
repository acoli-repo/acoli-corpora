"Why is there something
rather than nothing?"

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.496
In most of the multiverse,
there is nothing,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.336
and we live in one of the few places

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.360
where the laws of physics
allow there to be something.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.496
Even worse, we can't test
the idea of the multiverse.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.656
We can't access these other universes,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.920
so there's no way of knowing
whether they're there or not.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.976
So we're in an extremely
frustrating position.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.696
That doesn't mean
the multiverse doesn't exist.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.296
There are other planets,
other stars, other galaxies,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.496
so why not other universes?
