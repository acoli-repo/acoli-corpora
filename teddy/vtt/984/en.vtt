00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.844
Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:05.087
a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:08.554
in the wild for the last 28 years.

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:11.749
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.863
and what they might be doing with all that brainpower

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:15.338
in the wild.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.610
And we know they use some of that brainpower

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.774
for just living complicated lives,

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:22.634
but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:24.338
Well, we know a few things.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.527
We know that their brain-to-body ratio,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.497
which is a physical measure of intelligence,

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:30.993
is second only to humans.
