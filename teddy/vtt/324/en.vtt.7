00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.425
But beyond that,

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:33.552
many of you may have heard me clicking
as I came onto the stage --

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:34.619
(Clicking) --

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.488
with my tongue.

00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:39.666
Those are flashes of sound

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:44.746
that go out and reflect
from surfaces all around me,

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:46.118
just like a bat's sonar,

00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:51.738
and return to me with patterns, 
with pieces of information,

00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:54.225
much as light does for you.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.793
And my brain, thanks to my parents,

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:04.098
has been activated to form images
in my visual cortex,
