00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:35.254
and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:38.152
where the lectern was.

00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:41.066
So you can't trust those TED folks.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:44.653
"Find it yourself," they said.

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:48.063
So -- (Laughter)

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:52.525
And the feedback for the P.A. system
is no help at all.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:55.934
So now I present to you a challenge.

00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:59.850
So if you'd all close your eyes
for just a moment, okay?

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.507
And you're going to learn
a bit of flash sonar.
