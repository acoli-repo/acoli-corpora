00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:31.439
which has earned me the moniker

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.154
"the remarkable Batman."

00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:37.708
Now, Batman I will accept.

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:41.098
Bats are cool. Batman is cool.

00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:46.766
But I was not raised to think of myself
as in any way remarkable.

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:51.884
I have always regarded myself
much like anyone else

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:57.300
who navigates the dark unknowns
of their own challenges.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.718
Is that so remarkable?
