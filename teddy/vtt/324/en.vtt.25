it's the height of the room.

00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:37.127
Like I say, it's all that kind 
of three-dimensional surface geometry

00:12:37.127 --> 00:12:38.544
all around me.

00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:40.830
CA: Well, Daniel, you have done
a spectacular job

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.655
of helping us all see the world

00:12:43.655 --> 00:12:45.825
Thanks so much for that, truly.
DK: Thank you.

00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:50.214
