One of my students, who has now
become an instructor,

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:34.195
when he lost his vision,
after a few months

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.447
he was sitting in his three story house

00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:40.464
and he realized that he could hear
everything going on throughout the house:

00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:44.643
conversations, people in the kitchen,
people in the bathroom,

00:11:44.643 --> 00:11:47.337
several floors away, several walls away.

00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:50.889
He said it was something
like having x-ray vision.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:54.511
CA: What do you picture
that you're in right now?

00:11:54.511 --> 00:11:57.530
How do you picture this theater?

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:03.033
DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.
