and there's financial access.

So, physical access --

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.382

It's very expensive for low-income

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.471

“The last mile” is a phrase

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.544
to connect the customer to the provider.

00:03:23.568 --> 00:03:29.199

are last-mile retailers

00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:32.231
that bring these clean energy
products to the people.
