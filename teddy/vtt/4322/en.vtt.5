00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.066
and she said, “Mon chéri,
c'est trop Cher,”

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.778
which basically means,
“My dear, it's too expensive.”

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:35.267
But I tried to explain to her,

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:37.561
“Look, this is going to save you
a lot of money,

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:39.656
and it's going to give
you even better light

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.020
than what you're using
now with the kerosene.”

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:43.386
So I didn't make the sale,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.877
but I did learn a really important lesson,

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.909
which is that technology, products,

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.490
were not going to end energy poverty.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:52.698
Instead, access was going to.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.239
Specifically, there are
two types of access

00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:57.267
that are going to end energy poverty:

00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:00.551
there's physical access,
and there's financial access.
