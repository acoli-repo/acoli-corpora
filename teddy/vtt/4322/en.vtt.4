The prescriptions to solve energy poverty
seems pretty straightforward:

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.714
you develop these technologies
that have a great return on investment,

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.651
and people should be snatching them up.

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:08.032
But that's not the case.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:11.254
The first time I ever went down to Haiti
was in August of 2008,

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:12.491
sort of on a whim,

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.397
and I was fielding surveys
in the rural south of the country

00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:17.824
to assess the extent of energy poverty.

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:20.186
And at night, I would go around sometimes

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.397
and I would speak with the street vendors

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.683
and see if they were interested
in buying these solar LED lamps.

00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:28.551
One woman who I encountered
turned down my offer,

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.066
and she said, “Mon chéri,
c'est trop Cher,”
