00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:04.364
So, without romanticizing this too much:

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:08.024
imagine that you light your home
with kerosene and candles every night,

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.741
and that you do all of your cooking

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:10.926
with charcoal.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.812
This is how the world's
two billion poorest people

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:15.897
cook and light their homes every day.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.905
This isn't just inconvenient,

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.583
this is inefficient,

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:20.867
it's expensive,

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.581
it's harmful to human health,
harmful to the environment,

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:24.782
and it's unproductive.

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.135
And that's energy poverty.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.065
So let me give you a couple of examples.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.406
I work in Haiti,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.713
where about 80% of the population
lives in energy poverty.
