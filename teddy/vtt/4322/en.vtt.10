00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.333
So the next time you hear
about a technology or product

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.017
that's going to change the world,

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.438
be a little bit skeptical.

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:08.117
The inventor Dean Kamen,
the guy who invented the Segway,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.898
a genius by any standards,

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:15.175
once said that his job is easy,
inventing things is easy,

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.270
the hard part is the technology
dissemination --

00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:20.421
it's getting those
technologies and products

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.008
to the people who need it most.

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:23.207
Thank you.

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.583
