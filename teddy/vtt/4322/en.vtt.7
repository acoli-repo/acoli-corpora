already figured this out:

You can go to the most remote
village in Haiti

00:03:41.378 --> 00:03:44.763
and you will find somebody
selling kerosene and charcoal.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.226
So the other type of access: financial.

We all know that clean energy
products, technologies,

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:53.695

And so in the industrialized world,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.197
we have very generous subsidies
that are specifically designed
