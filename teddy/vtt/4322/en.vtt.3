00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.004
is by adapting fuels
that are more efficient,

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:33.528
that are less expensive,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.538
that are better for human health,
better for the environment

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.021
and that are more productive.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.731
So it turns out that those fuels
and technologies exist,

00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:42.334
and this is an example of that.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:45.161
This is a solar LED lightbulb

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:50.142
that we sell for a retail price
of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.123
That's a payback period
of less than three months

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:54.933
for the average Haitian household.

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.305
The prescriptions to solve energy poverty
seems pretty straightforward:
