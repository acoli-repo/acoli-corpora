00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.318
which is made from trees,

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:03.092
and has left the country
almost completely deforested.

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:07.849
Without trees, the country can't absorb
heavy rains and massive flooding,

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:09.210
as a result.

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.800
So in the industrialized world,

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:14.729
we built walls that protect us
from the externalities of our energy use;

00:01:14.753 --> 00:01:18.466
we can afford to clean up acute
environmental disasters;

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.782
and we can also afford
to adapt to chronic conditions

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:23.406
like climate change.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.095
That's not the case for Haiti.
They can't afford this.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.295
The only way they're going to lift
themselves out of energy poverty

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.004
is by adapting fuels
that are more efficient,
