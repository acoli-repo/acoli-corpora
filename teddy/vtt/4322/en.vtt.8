00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.197
we have very generous subsidies
that are specifically designed

00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.789
to bring down those upfront costs.

00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:04.888
Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti.

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.396
What they do have is microfinance.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.244
But you're going to severely diminish
the value proposition

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:11.678
of your clean energy product

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:15.127
if you expect somebody in Haiti
to go out, get a microloan,

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:16.556
go back to the retailer,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.759
and then buy the clean energy product.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.388
So the prescription to end energy poverty
is much more complicated

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.422
than simply products.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:28.169
We need to integrate financial access

00:04:28.193 --> 00:04:31.998
directly into new, innovative
distribution models.
