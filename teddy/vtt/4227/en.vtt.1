In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
this was my passion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
