It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Applause)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Those are conveyor belts that go around.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but then you'll see the ones up above.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and then test them for a few hours.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.
