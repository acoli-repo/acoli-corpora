00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That really, the mixing of art and science was computers,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.
