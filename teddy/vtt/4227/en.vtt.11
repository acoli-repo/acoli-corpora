And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.

This is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
one, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.
