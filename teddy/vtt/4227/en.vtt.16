who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
there are four of them --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
That the reason that you want to be below two watts is

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
