Here's the six. We went to the six,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And so I went to each of those countries

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Not something you'd envy or want to do.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.
