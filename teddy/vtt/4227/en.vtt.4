where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Something that would be important, but also something

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
knowing people who were either executives or wealthy,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My career, I mean, I'd done my career.
