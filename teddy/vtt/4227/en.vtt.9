What he observed was that kids who write computer programs

That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.

Kids don't program enough and boy,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000

This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and
