00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it got a lot of people absolutely interested.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The first day it was just wild. And then we said,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?
