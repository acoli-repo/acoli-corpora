My career, I mean, I'd done my career.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Didn't have to worry about earning money.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and bringing to the world the access of the computers,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.
