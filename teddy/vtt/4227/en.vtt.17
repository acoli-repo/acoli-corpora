And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.

And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And, in English, the word "cheap" has

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
a double meaning, which is really appropriate,
