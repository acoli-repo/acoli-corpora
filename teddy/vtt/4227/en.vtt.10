This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and

a third, that I've never even seen before.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This photograph is very important because it's much later.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.
