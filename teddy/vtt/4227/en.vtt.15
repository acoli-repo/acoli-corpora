Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."
