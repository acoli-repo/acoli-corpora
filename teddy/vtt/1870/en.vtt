My name is Amit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and I pitched this idea

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of doing something with museums and art

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to my boss who's actually here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and she allowed me to do it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it took 18 months.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But I'm going to focus on the demo.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it's access.
