00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:03.796
When we think about negotiations,
we think about being tough.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.756
We charge in like it's a battle,

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:08.436
brandishing our influence
and our power moves.

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:12.316
But a negotiation doesn't have to be
a fight with winners and losers.

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.396
Think of it more like a dance,

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:17.396
two or more people moving fluidly in sync.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:20.396
[The Way We Work]

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:24.636
We constantly negotiate at work.

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:29.756
We negotiate for higher pay, promotions,
vacations and even greater autonomy.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:33.756
In fact, every day we negotiate
just to get our job done
