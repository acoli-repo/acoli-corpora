when unlettered people
like us give him suggestions

00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:05.655
that maybe we could use
this word or that instead.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:06.788
So our film was called

00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:07.963
"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai."

00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:10.743
(Cheers)

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:13.568
And he did not like the title at all.

00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:17.790
So once when he was really mad at us kids,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.962
who are like his kids even now,

00:08:20.024 --> 00:08:21.374
he retorted:

00:08:21.597 --> 00:08:24.781
"Now my heart remains
neither awake nor rests.

00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:27.781
What do I do? 
Oh! I feel something strange.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.014
Is that what you want?"
