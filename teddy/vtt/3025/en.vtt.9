00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:30.803
the clearer your thoughts,

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.985
and the more clearly you can convey them.

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:37.798
Nowadays I often hear,
especially from young ones,

00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:39.187
“You know what I mean?"

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:41.582
No, I don't know what you mean.

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.185
(Laughter)

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:47.097
“You know what I mean,”
is running out of words.

00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:50.416
Everything is now moving fast

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.567
so communication has to be fast as well.

00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.710
But the tragedy is

00:04:56.123 --> 00:05:01.410
that we have attained this speed
at the cost of depth of words.
