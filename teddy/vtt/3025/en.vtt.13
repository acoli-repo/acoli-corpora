00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.550
our experience, our learning
and our knowledge to the next generation.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.516
So we don’t only live on instinct

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:40.770
but our slowly accumulated experience

00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:43.904
and knowledge over generations
is passed on to the next.

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:46.365
Through what? Through words.

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:48.649
And if we didn’t have these words

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:51.952
our advantage is gradually over

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:55.563
other species would diminish over time.

00:06:55.977 --> 00:07:00.254
We advanced only because we have language.
