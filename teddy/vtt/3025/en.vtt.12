00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.419
So language is a very powerful thing.

00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:02.304
Words are extremely powerful.

00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:05.283
But by themselves,
they are neither good nor bad.

00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:08.315
If we start loving words

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.831
and understand their power,

00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:12.886
we would realize

00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:14.946
that everything that happens
in the world is because of words.

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:18.274
Or there would be nothing
between us and the rest of the creatures,

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.436
the rest of the animals,
although we too are animals.

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:25.525
The only difference is that
we can pass on, through our words,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.550
our experience, our learning
and our knowledge to the next generation.
