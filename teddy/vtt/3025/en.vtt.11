00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:31.880
And these words, as long as words exist,

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:33.721
they aren’t there just for a meaning.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:35.562
They are also a conveyer belt

00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:37.243
of language, words.

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.880
They reflect your culture,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.983
your traditions, your inheritance,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.591
your cultural wealth accumulated

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:47.861
over generations, all of that
is carried forward with words.

00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:54.904
If you cut a man off from some words,
you cut him off from a culture, a history.

00:05:55.317 --> 00:05:57.556
This is exactly what is happening
with us today.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.419
So language is a very powerful thing.
