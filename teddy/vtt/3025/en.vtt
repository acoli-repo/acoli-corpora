Shah Rukh Khan: The speaker
you are about to meet is

00:00:04.177 --> 00:00:11.447
someone who knows and understands
the value of words like no one else does.

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:14.858
In his writing career
spanning over four decades,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:18.986
this man has chosen words
with beauty and versatility,

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:21.453
like a flower springing to life ...

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.455
like Mr. Bachchanâ€™s memorable punches ...

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.058
(Laughter)

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.141
like a best-selling book of Urdu poetry ...
