00:06:55.977 --> 00:07:00.254
We advanced only because we have language.

00:07:00.757 --> 00:07:02.502
And if we didn’t have that

00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:03.813
we wouldn’t be here.

00:07:04.443 --> 00:07:06.318
We would be right where we started.

00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:07.964
So what does language mean?

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:09.272
Words!

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:11.204
So learn to respect words.

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.429
Love them.

00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:15.381
Befriend them.

00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:17.199
Listen to them attentively.

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.921
And speak attentively.

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:19.873
Thank you!

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:26.898
(Applause)
