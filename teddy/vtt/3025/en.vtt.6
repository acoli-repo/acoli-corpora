00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:02.092
For an average noun
or an average verb, an average mind

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.307
can quickly create reference.

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.860
Where did they hear it? See it?

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.515
What does it remind them of?

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.445
What is its connection?
When was it last used in conversation?

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.293
What has been my experience with it?

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:17.953
A host of memories appear
when you hear a word you remember.

00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:19.569
And a good writer or orator is one

00:03:19.594 --> 00:03:23.577
who knows that when
he uses a certain word,

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:26.843
an average mind will associate it
with a certain reference,

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:29.063
specific memories will be evoked.

00:03:29.093 --> 00:03:32.889
Then he can create a world around a word.
