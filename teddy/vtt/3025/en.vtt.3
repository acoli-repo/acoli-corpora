You once saw

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:35.565
an animal and decided it’s a "cat."

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.792
But cat is a sound.

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.423
This cat has nothing
to do with the animal.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.336
But I have decided it’s a cat.

00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:44.573
So a cat it is.

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:48.510
So I gave the sound
the identity of this animal.

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:51.073
After that I made a semicircle,

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.653
a pyramid, cut into half,

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:57.881
then a straight line,
then another below it, and wrote: "cat."

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.915
In these criss-crossed lines,
I filled a sound
