00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.915
In these criss-crossed lines,
I filled a sound

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:02.442
and into that sound, a meaning.

00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.797
Now like with this cat,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.425
even with love, anger, a thought,

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:14.021
an idea, pain, suffering,
happiness, surprise,

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.333
everything has been linked with a sound.

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:20.578
And then sounds were fit
into some criss-crossed lines

00:02:20.603 --> 00:02:22.769
that we call a script.

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.975
So three things that had nothing in common

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:28.301
were joined by us to create a word.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:34.161
A sound that is actually gibberish
has been added onto it.
