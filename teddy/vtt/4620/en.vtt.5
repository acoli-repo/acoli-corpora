The stoop is a place
that invites neighbors to gather,

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:35.721
blast music, and watch the city in motion.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.718
It's fascinating to me that you see people
wanting to hang out on the stairs.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:44.377
I think they fill
a deeply human need we have

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:48.603
to inhabit a space
more than just on the ground plane.

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:52.157
And so if you're able to sit
halfway up there,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:54.903
you're in a kind of magical place.
