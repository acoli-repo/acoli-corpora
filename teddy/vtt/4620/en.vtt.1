Riser, which is the vertical element
that separates the two treads.

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:33.967
A lot of stairs have nosings
that create a kind of edge.

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.762
And then, the connected piece
is a stringer.

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.361
Those pieces, in different forms,
make up all stairs.

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:44.616
I assume stairs came to be
from the first time someone said,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.664
"I want to get to this higher rock
from the lower rock."

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:49.910
People climbed
using whatever was available:

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:52.157
stepped logs, ladders

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.846
and natural pathways
that were worn over time.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.513
Some of the earliest staircases,
like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.822
or the roads to Mount Tai in China,
