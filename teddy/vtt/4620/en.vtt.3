00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.885
As we move across a stairway,

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.249
the form dictates our pacing,
our feeling, our safety

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:39.059
and our relationship and engagement
with the space around us.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.249
So for a second, think about stepping down
a gradual, monumental staircase

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:46.750
like the one in front
of the New York Public Library.

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.400
From those steps,

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.646
you have a view of the street
and all the people around you,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.702
and your walk is slow and steady
because the tread is so wide.

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.980
That's a totally different experience

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.023
than going down the narrow staircase
to, say, an old pub,
