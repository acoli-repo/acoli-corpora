00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.899
I think stairs may be

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:07.417
one of the most emotionally
malleable physical elements

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.112
that an architect has to work with.

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:11.566
[Small thing. Big idea.]

[David Rockwell on
the Stairs]

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.110
At its most basic, a stair is a way
to get from point A to point B

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:20.713
at different elevations.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.269
Stairs have a common language.

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:26.126
Treads, which is the thing
that you walk on.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.063
Riser, which is the vertical element
that separates the two treads.
