00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.023
than going down the narrow staircase
to, say, an old pub,

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:02.696

Stairs add enormous drama.

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.744
Think about how stairs
signaled a grand entrance

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:13.623

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.963
The stoop is a place
that invites neighbors to gather,
