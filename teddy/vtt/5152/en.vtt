Margaret Atwood:
It's like going into a very cold lake

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.516
when you've decided
you're going to go swimming in it.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.326
Adam Grant: This is how one famous
writer describes procrastination.

MA: You put your foot in, you take it out.

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:13.756

It's still too cold. (Laughs)

00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:19.524
You think, "Am I going to do this or not?
Am I really going to do this?"

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:20.916
No, yes, no, yes.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.786
That goes on for a while.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.146
If you're going to do it,
you run in screaming.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.286
AG: So says Margaret Atwood.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.436

of "The Handmaid's Tale"
