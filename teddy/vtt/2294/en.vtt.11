00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.855
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.292
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:38.555
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.313
They raise their hands like this.

00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:42.948
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing

00:05:42.972 --> 00:05:45.472
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:47.765
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.583
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:52.945
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.827
I notice a couple of things about this.

00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.661
One, you're not going to be surprised.

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:58.703
It seems to be related to gender.

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:04.168
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.
