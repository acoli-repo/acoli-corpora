00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:01.445
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.571
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.224
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.

00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:09.655
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:12.299
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.

00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:13.913
We do the opposite of them.

00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:17.112
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:19.649
and what do I notice?

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:26.902
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.450
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.855
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room
