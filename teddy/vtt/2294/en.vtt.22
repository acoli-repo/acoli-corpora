00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.651
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:04.202
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:05.859
We want them to be feeling power.

00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:07.218
So two minutes they do this.

00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:10.427
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,

00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:12.794
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:15.559
and then we take another saliva sample.

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:17.441
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:19.026
So this is what we find.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.930
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:25.068
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,

00:11:25.092 --> 00:11:27.226
86 percent of you will gamble.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.346
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.346
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.
