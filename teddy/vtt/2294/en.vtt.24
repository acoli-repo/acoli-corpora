So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes

00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:03.438
that configure your brain

00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:07.739
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,

00:12:07.763 --> 00:12:12.816
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.603
And we've all had the feeling, right?

00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:20.811
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:23.267
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.694
Also, our bodies change our minds.

00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:28.100
But the next question, of course,

00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:29.944
is, can power posing for a few minutes

00:12:29.968 --> 00:12:32.005
really change your life
in meaningful ways?
