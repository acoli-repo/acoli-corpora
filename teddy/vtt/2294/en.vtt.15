00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:32.896
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.444
So when you feel powerful,

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.239
you're more likely to do this,

00:07:37.263 --> 00:07:43.441
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,

00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:46.864
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.

00:07:46.888 --> 00:07:49.924
So the second question
really was, you know,

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:52.507
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,

00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:56.924
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?

00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:59.651
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,

00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:01.023
what am I talking about?
