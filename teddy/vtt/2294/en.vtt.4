00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.771
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:03.876
looking at the effects
of our body language,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.185
or other people's body language,
on judgments.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.624
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:13.614
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:17.407
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:22.092
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:26.564
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:29.588
of real physician-patient interactions,

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.421
their judgments
of the physician's niceness
