00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:31.093
It's you talking to yourself.

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:34.176
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.742
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:39.028
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:40.922
You're looking at your notes,

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:42.946
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.399
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,

00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:48.460
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.

00:13:48.484 --> 00:13:50.246
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.064
So we bring people into a lab,

00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:55.441
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,

00:13:55.465 --> 00:13:58.073
they go through
a very stressful job interview.

00:13:58.097 --> 00:14:01.689
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.
