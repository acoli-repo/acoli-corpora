It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this

00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:04.708
or doing a job interview.

00:13:04.732 --> 00:13:07.400
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to

00:13:07.424 --> 00:13:10.319
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:13.074
So we published these findings,

00:13:13.098 --> 00:13:14.659
and the media are all over it,

00:13:14.683 --> 00:13:16.758
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:18.855
when you go in
for the job interview, right?

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.886
(Laughter)

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.357
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,

00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:24.653
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:26.917
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:29.508
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.

00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:31.093
It's you talking to yourself.
