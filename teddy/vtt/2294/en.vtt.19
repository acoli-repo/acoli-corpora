00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:31.832
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:34.924
if an alpha needs to take over,

00:09:34.948 --> 00:09:39.162
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,

00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:42.273
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:45.778
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.

00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:48.819
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:51.185
the mind, at least at the facial level,

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:55.314
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:58.096
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.680
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,
