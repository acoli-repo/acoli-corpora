00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.528
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.

00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:35.791
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.635
Physiologically,
there also are differences

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.700
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,

00:08:42.724 --> 00:08:46.394
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:53.539
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies

00:08:53.563 --> 00:08:56.737
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.669
and powerful and effective leaders
