I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:34.808
and I teach at a competitive
business school,

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:39.292
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:43.104
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.107
of power and dominance.

00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.846
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.929
Well, this is what they are.

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.807
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.817
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.758
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.

00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:00.704
It's about opening up.
