WEBVTT

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:00.136
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.862
that makes you seem more powerful?

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:05.314
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people

00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:07.719
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.165
But our question really was,

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.229
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?

00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:15.919
There's some evidence that they do.

00:07:15.943 --> 00:07:20.555
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:22.733
but also, when we're forced to smile

00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:27.148
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.

00:07:27.172 --> 00:07:29.090
So it goes both ways.

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:32.896
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.
