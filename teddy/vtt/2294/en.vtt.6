emoticons used well in online negotiations

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:05.722
can lead you to claim more value
from that negotiation.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.945
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.042
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.944
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.

00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.064
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience

00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:20.499
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:23.712
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.075
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.138
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:32.081
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,
