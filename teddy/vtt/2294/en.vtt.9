00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.493
She shows that people
who are born with sight

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:33.434
and people who are congenitally
blind do this

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.748
when they win at a physical competition.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:38.226
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.727
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.044
They do this.

00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:44.566
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.653
What do we do when we feel powerless?

00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.432
We do exactly the opposite.

00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:50.960
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:52.328
We make ourselves small.

00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:54.708
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.465
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:01.445
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.
