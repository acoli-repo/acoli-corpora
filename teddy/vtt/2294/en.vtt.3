Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.640
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:35.780
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.731
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:43.119
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.999
it's language, so we think
about communication.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.026
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.465
So what is your body language
communicating to me?

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.531
What's mine communicating to you?

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:59.503
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.771
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time
