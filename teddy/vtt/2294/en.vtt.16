00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:01.023
what am I talking about?

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.189
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:06.785
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:09.852
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:14.186
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.482
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:22.706
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.016
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.884
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.528
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.
