00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.153
Oliver was an extremely dashing,

00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:09.974
handsome, charming and largely unstable male

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.159
that I completely lost my heart to.

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.080
(Laughter)

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.746
He was a Bernese mountain dog,

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:20.929
and my ex-husband and I adopted him,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.618
and about six months in,

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:25.182
we realized that he was a mess.

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:27.962
He had such paralyzing separation anxiety

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.498
that we couldn't leave him alone.

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:32.626
Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.
