00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.360
From there, it has a clear path
to reach the ocean.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.816
So the aquifer water is a part

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.136
of the three millimeters
per year of sea level rise

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.480
that we experience as a global society.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.776
But there's more:

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.560
the aquifer water
might be punching above its weight.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.640
The ice flows in complex ways.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.936
In some places, the ice flows very fast.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.680
There tends to be water
at the base of the ice sheet here.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.016
In other places, not so fast.
