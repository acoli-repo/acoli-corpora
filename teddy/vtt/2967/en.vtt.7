00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.480
seven stories beneath her feet.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.576
Here, she's used a pump

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.816
to bring some of that water
back to the ice sheet's surface.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.600
Just six years ago, we had no idea
this glacier aquifer existed.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.136
The aquifer formed

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.536
when snow melts in the summer sun

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.840
and trickles downward.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.720
It puddles up in huge pools.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.136
From there, the snow acts as an igloo,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.040
insulating this water
from the cold and the wind above.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.616
So the water can stay
hidden in the ice sheet

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040
in liquid form year after year.
