00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.000
it would drown Australia knee-deep.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.120
How is this possible?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.616
Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.096
We used radar to image the hills,
valleys, mountains and depressions

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.936
that the ice flows over.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.456
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels
the size of the Grand Canyon

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.680
that funnel ice and water
off of Greenland and into the ocean.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.856
The reason that radar
can reveal the bedrock

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.736
is that ice is entirely
transparent to radar.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.296
You can do an experiment.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160
Go home and put
an ice cube in the microwave.
