00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.856
You can look to the smaller
panel on the right

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.040
to see the true scale
for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.016
As the aquifer water
flows into the crevasse,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.016
some of it refreezes
in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.536
That's about as cold
as your kitchen freezer.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.536
But this loss can be overcome

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.800
if the flow rate in from
the glacier aquifer is high enough.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.016
In our case, it is,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.656
and the aquifer water drives the crevasse
all the way to the base of the ice sheet

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.400
a thousand meters below.
