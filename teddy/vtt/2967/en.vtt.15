00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.016
In other places, not so fast.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.520
Usually, there's not water
present at the base there.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.376
Now that we know the aquifer water
is getting to the base of the ice sheet,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.136
the next question is:

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.640
Is it making the ice itself
flow faster into the ocean?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.816
We're trying to uncover these mysteries
hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.160
so that we can better plan
for the sea level rise it holds.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.456
The amount of ice
that Greenland has lost since 2002

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.000
is just a small fraction
of what that ice sheet holds.
