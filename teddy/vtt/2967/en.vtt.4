00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.696
Other areas experience snowfall

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.840
or gain ice back in the winter.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.696
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed
by an overall rate of mass loss

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.600
that would have stunned
a glaciologist 50 years ago.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.680
We never thought that an ice sheet could
lose mass into the ocean this quickly.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.896
Since these measurements began in 2002,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.056
the ice sheet has lost so much ice

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.696
that if that water were piled up
on our smallest continent,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.000
it would drown Australia knee-deep.
