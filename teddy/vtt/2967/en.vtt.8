00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040
in liquid form year after year.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.696
The question is, what happens next?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.456
Does the water stay there forever?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.696
It could.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.360
Or does it find a way out
to reach the global ocean?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.776
One possible way
for the water to reach the bedrock

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.456
and from there the ocean

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.959
is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.176
When cracks fill with water,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.000
the weight of the water
forces them deeper and deeper.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.016
This is how fracking works

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.056
to extract natural gas
from deep within the earth.
