00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.496
It can be as simple
as the next number in a sequence --

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.600
one, three, five, seven --

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.696
or it can be a more complex
set of equations

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.096
that predict the future

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.080
based on known conditions in the present.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.160
In our case, what are
the equations for how ice cracks?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.816
Well, engineers already have
a very good understanding

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.640
of how aluminum, steel and plastics
fracture under stress.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.200
It's an important problem in our society.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.016
And it turns out
that the engineering equations

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.616
for how materials fracture

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.376
are not that different
from my physics homework.
