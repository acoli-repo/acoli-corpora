00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.016
When was I was 21 years old,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.840
I had all this physics homework.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.135
Physics homework requires taking breaks,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.760
and Wikipedia was relatively new,
so I took a lot of breaks there.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.456
I kept going back to the same articles,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.136
reading them again and again,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.560
on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.856
How cool would it be to visit these places

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.440
and what would it take to do so?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.496
Well, here we are

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.936
on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.616
operated by NASA
