00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.056
to extract natural gas
from deep within the earth.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.160
Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.880
All it takes is a crack to get started.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.176
Well, we recently discovered

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.096
that there are cracks available
in the Greenland ice sheet

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.760
near this glacier aquifer.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.696
You can fly over
most of the Greenland ice sheet

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.936
and see nothing,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.856
no cracks, no features on the surface,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.056
but as this helicopter
flies towards the coast,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.696
the path that water would take
on its quest to flow downhill,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.296
one crack appears,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.320
then another and another.
