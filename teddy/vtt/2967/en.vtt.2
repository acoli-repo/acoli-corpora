00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.576
But it's not just static.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.040
The ice flows like a river
downhill towards the ocean.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.976
As it flows around bends,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.720
it deforms and cracks.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.296
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.416
which are located in one of the most
remote physical environments

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.880
remaining on earth.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.016
To work in glaciology right now
is like getting in on the ground floor

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.960
at Facebook in the 2000s.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.096
(Laughter)

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.256
Our capability to fly airplanes
and satellites over the ice sheets

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.496
is revolutionizing glaciology.
