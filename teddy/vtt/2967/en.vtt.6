00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160
Go home and put
an ice cube in the microwave.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.696
It won't melt,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.816
because microwaves, or radar,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.200
pass straight through the ice
without interacting.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.496
If you want to melt your ice cube,
you have to get it wet,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.216
because water heats up easily
in the microwave.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.576
That's the whole principle
the microwave oven is designed around.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.240
Radar can see water.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.816
And radar has revealed
a vast pool of liquid water

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.776
hidden under my colleague Olivia,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.480
seven stories beneath her feet.
