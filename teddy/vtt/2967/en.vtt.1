00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.616
operated by NASA

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.440
flying over the Greenland ice sheet.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.016
There's a lot to see here,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.816
but there's more that is hidden,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.120
waiting to be uncovered.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.656
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.640
is that there's liquid water
hidden inside the ice sheet,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.204
because we didn't know that yet.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.576
I did learn on Wikipedia
that the Greenland ice sheet is huge,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.896
the size of Mexico,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.320
and its ice from top to bottom
is two miles thick.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.576
But it's not just static.
