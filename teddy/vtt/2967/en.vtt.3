WEBVTT

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.496
is revolutionizing glaciology.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.456
It's just starting to do for science

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.640
what the smartphone
has done for social media.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.296
The satellites are reporting
a wealth of observations

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
that are revealing new hidden facts
about the ice sheets continuously.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.136
For instance, we have observations
of the size of the Greenland ice sheet

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.720
every month going back to 2002.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.696
You can look towards the bottom
of the screen here

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.696
to see the month and the year go forward.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.216
You can see that some areas
of the ice sheet melt

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.000
or lose ice in the summer.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.696
Other areas experience snowfall
