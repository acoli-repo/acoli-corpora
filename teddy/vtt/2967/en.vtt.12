00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.376
are not that different
from my physics homework.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.256
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.736
and then I had a numeric model
for how a crevasse can fracture

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760
when filled with water from the aquifer.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.736
This is the power of math.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.880
It can help us understand
real processes in our world.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.576
I'll show you now
the results of my numeric model,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.176
but first I should point out

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.016
that the crevasse is about
a thousand times narrower than it is deep,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.536
so in the main panel here,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.656
we've zoomed in to better see the details.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.856
You can look to the smaller
panel on the right
