00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.000
is just a small fraction
of what that ice sheet holds.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.976
Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines
that operate on long timescales.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.576
In the next 80 years, global sea levels
will rise at least 20 centimeters,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.776
perhaps as much as one meter,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.576
and maybe more.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.736
Our understanding
of future sea level rise is good,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.136
but our projections have a wide range.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.336
It's our role as glaciologists
and scientists

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.080
to narrow these uncertainties.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.016
How much sea level rise is coming,
