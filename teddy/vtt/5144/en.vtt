In the mid-19th century,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.920
suspension bridges 
were collapsing all across Europe.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.323
Their industrial cables 
frayed during turbulent weather

00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:19.259
and snapped 
under the weight of their decks.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.720
So when a German-American engineer 
named John Roebling

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.510
proposed building the largest 
and most expensive suspension bridge

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.520
ever conceived 
over New Yorkâ€™s East River,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.650
city officials 
were understandably skeptical.
