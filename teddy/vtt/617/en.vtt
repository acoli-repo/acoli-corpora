00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:03.809
I am an astrophysicist.

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:06.888
I research stellar explosions
across the universe.

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:08.803
But I have a flaw:

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.808
I'm restless, and I get bored easily.

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:15.552
And although as an astrophysicist,
I have the incredible opportunity

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:17.508
to study the entire universe,

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:20.880
the thought of doing
only that, always that,

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:23.135
makes me feel caged and limited.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:28.676
What if my issues with
keeping attention and getting bored

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.182
were not a flaw, though?
