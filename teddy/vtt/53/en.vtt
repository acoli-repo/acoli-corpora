00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:03.837
I am guilty of stacking
my dishes in the sink

00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:05.782
and leaving them there for hours.

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.600
I fact-checked this with my boyfriend.

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.251
He says it's less like hours
and more like days,

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:12.496
but that's not the point.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.909
The point is sometimes
I don't finish the job

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.743
until the stack has gotten high enough
that it's peaking over the lip of the sink

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.524
and my inner clean freak loses it.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.172
This charming habit developed
when I was in college,

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:26.460
and I had tons of excuses.

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:28.489
"I'm running to class!"

00:00:28.513 --> 00:00:30.604
"What's one more dirty dish in the sink?"
