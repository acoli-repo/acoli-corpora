00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So the team actually developed a new code

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
within the code within the code.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So it's a new code

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
messages in the genetic code for a long time,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because, if you write long messages

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
with the code that the mathematicians developed,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it would more than likely lead to

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
new proteins being synthesized
