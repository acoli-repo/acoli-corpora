00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to get new cells.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
which is why we chose the smallest genome.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to a much larger one.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we can walk through the reasons for that,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but basically the small cell

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
took on the order of

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
one to two months to get results from,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
whereas the larger, faster-growing cell

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
takes only two days.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So there's only so many cycles we could go through

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in a year at six weeks per cycle.
