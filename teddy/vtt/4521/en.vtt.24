00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
new proteins being synthesized

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
with unknown functions.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
actually puts frequent stop codons,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
so it's a different alphabet

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but allows us to use

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the entire English alphabet

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
with punctuation and numbers.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So, there are four major watermarks

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The first one actually contains within it

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this code for interpreting

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
the rest of the genetic code.
