00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
a chromosome out of yeast.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Because of the problems with

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
about a year and a half ago,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we decided to synthesize

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
for transplantation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And Dan led the team for the synthesis

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and it set us back three months
