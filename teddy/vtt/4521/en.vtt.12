00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We think in part, because of its slow growth

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and, in part,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to keep these events from happening.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and was happy to eat

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the synthetic DNA that we gave it

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and never got transplantations.
