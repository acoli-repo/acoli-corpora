00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but as soon as that was done

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we got back to the task at hand.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In 2002, we started

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
a new institute,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
where we set out two goals:

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
One, to understand

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the impact of our technology on the environment,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and how to understand the environment better,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and two, to start down this process

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
of making synthetic life

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to understand basic life.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In 2003,
