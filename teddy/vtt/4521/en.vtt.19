00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
a life-forming sequence.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We narrowed it down to one fragment;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
we sequenced it

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and found just one base pair had been deleted

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in an essential gene.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So accuracy is essential.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
There's parts of the genome

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
where it cannot tolerate even a single error,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and then there's parts of the genome

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
where we can put in large blocks of DNA,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
as we did with the watermarks,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So it took about three months to find that error

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and repair it.
