00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
out of yeast and methylated it,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we could then transplant it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Further advances came

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
from the recipient capricolum cell.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And once we had done that, now we can take

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So last fall

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
when we published the results of that work in Science,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
we all became overconfident

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and were sure we were only

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
a few weeks away

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
from being able to now boot up

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
a chromosome out of yeast.
