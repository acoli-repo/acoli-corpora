00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this is the first self-replicating species

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we've had on the planet

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
whose parent is a computer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It also is the first species

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to have its own website

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
encoded in its genetic code.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But we'll talk more about

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the watermarks in a minute.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a project that had its inception

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
15 years ago

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
when our team then --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we called the institute TIGR --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
was involved in sequencing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the first two genomes in history.
