00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
In the vaccine area,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Synthetic Genomics and the Institute

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
are forming a new vaccine company

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because we think these tools can affect vaccines

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
to diseases that haven't been possible to date,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
things where the viruses rapidly evolve,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
such with rhinovirus.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Or, more importantly, HIV,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
where the virus evolves so quickly

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the vaccines that are made today

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
can't keep up

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
with those evolutionary changes.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
