00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There were several steps to this. There were two sides:

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We had to solve the chemistry

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for making large DNA molecules,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and we had to solve the biological side

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of how, if we had this new chemical entity,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
how would we boot it up, activate it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in a recipient cell.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We had two teams working in parallel:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
one team on the chemistry,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and the other on trying to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
be able to transplant

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
entire chromosomes

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to get new cells.
