Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you have to think about all the pitfalls

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and things that could lead you

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and, even worse, leading others to believe it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So, we thought the worst problem would be

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
a single molecule contamination

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of the native chromosome,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
leading us to believe that we actually had

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
created a synthetic cell,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
when it would have been just a contaminant.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So early on, we developed the notion

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
of putting in watermarks in the DNA
