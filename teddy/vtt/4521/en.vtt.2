00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the first two genomes in history.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We did Haemophilus influenzae

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that of Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And as soon as

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we had these two sequences

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of a self-replicating species,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
could there be even a smaller genome?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Could we understand the basis of cellular life

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
at the genetic level?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's been a 15-year quest

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
just to get to the starting point now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to be able to answer those questions,
