00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and transplant them.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When we did these experiments, though,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we could get the chromosome out of yeast

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That little issue took the team two years to solve.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
was actually methylated,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
from digesting the DNA.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So what we found is if we took the chromosome

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
out of yeast and methylated it,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we could then transplant it.
