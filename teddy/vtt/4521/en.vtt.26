00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
they can send an email to that address.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So it's clearly distinguishable

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
from any other species,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
having 46 names in it,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
its own web address.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And we added three quotations,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
because with the first genome

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
than just signing the work.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So we won't give the rest of the code,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but we will give the three quotations.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The first is,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"To live, to err,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to fall, to triumph
