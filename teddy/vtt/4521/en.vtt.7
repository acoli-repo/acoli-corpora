00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It was the first DNA phage,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
DNA virus, DNA genome

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that was actually sequenced.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So once we realized

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that we could make 5,000-base pair

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
viral-sized pieces,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we thought, we at least have the means

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to be able to eventually assemble them together

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to make this mega base chromosome.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, substantially larger than

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we even thought we would go initially.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There were several steps to this. There were two sides:
