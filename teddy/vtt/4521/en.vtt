00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're here today to announce

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the first synthetic cell,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a cell made by

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
starting with the digital code in the computer,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
building the chromosome

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from four bottles of chemicals,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
assembling that chromosome in yeast,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
transplanting it into

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a recipient bacterial cell

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and transforming that cell

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
into a new bacterial species.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this is the first self-replicating species
