00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But before we did the first experiments,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we actually asked

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to undertake a review

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of what the risks, the challenges,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the ethics around creating new

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
species in the laboratory were

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because it hadn't been done before.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They spent about two years

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
reviewing that independently

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and published their results in Science in 1999.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Ham and I took two years off

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
as a side project to sequence the human genome,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but as soon as that was done
