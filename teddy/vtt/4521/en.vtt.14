WEBVTT

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So in addition to doing the transplant,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
out of the eukaryotic yeast

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
into a form where we could transplant it

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
into a recipient cell.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So our team developed new techniques

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
for actually growing, cloning

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So we took the same mycoides genome

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that Carole had initially transplanted,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and we grew that in yeast

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
as an artificial chromosome.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And we thought this would be a great test bed

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
