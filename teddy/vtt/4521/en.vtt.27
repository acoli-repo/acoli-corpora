00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"To live, to err,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to fall, to triumph

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and to recreate life out of life."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's a James Joyce quote.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but as they might be."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
book on Robert Oppenheimer.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
"What I cannot build,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I cannot understand."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So, because this is as much a philosophical advance
