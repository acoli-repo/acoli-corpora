00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to be able to answer those questions,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because it's very difficult to eliminate

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
multiple genes from a cell.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can only do them one at a time.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We decided early on

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that we had to take a synthetic route,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
even though nobody had been there before,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to see if we could synthesize

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a bacterial chromosome

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so we could actually vary the gene content

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to understand the essential genes for life.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That started our 15-year quest

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to get here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But before we did the first experiments,
