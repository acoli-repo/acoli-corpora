00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
of putting in watermarks in the DNA

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to absolutely make clear

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that the DNA was synthetic.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And the first chromosome we built

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in 2008 --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the 500,000-base pair one --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
we simply assigned

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the names of the authors of the chromosome

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
into the genetic code,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but it was using just amino acid

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
single letter translations,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So the team actually developed a new code
