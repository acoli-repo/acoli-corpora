00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the policy issues

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in parallel with the scientific advances.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So with that, I would like

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to open it first to the floor for questions.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes, in the back.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
how significant a breakthrough this is please?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's significant to us.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in how we view life.
