00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In 2003,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we published our first success.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
developed some new methods

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for making error-free DNA

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
at a small level.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Our first task was

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a virus that attacks only E. coli.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the phage phi X 174,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which was chosen for historical reasons.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It was the first DNA phage,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
DNA virus, DNA genome
