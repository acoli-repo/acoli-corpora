00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
from one bacteria to another.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that we've ever done

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because it showed how dynamic life was.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And we knew, once that worked,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that we actually had a chance

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
if we could make the synthetic chromosomes

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to do the same with those.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We didn't know that it was going to take us

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
several years more to get there.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In 2008,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we reported the complete synthesis

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
