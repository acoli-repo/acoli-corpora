00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:03.222
When we think about prejudice and bias,

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:05.366
we tend to think about stupid and evil people

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.820
doing stupid and evil things.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.890
And this idea is nicely summarized

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.358
by the British critic William Hazlitt,

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.293
who wrote, "Prejudice is the child of ignorance."

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:17.405
I want to try to convince you here

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.040
that this is mistaken.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.772
I want to try to convince you

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:22.495
that prejudice and bias

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:25.783
are natural, they're often rational,

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.614
and they're often even moral,

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.866
and I think that once we understand this,

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.375
we're in a better position to make sense of them
