00:00:01.028 --> 00:00:03.187
I love to collect things.

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:05.177
Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:07.906
of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces

00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:11.144
from all around the world to insects

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.548
that I've captured and put in jars.

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:15.585
Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.521
that I love the Natural History Museum

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.921
and the collections of animals

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.736
at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.873
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:24.290
that you can go and look at,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.025
and they memorialize a specific point of time

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.672
in this animal's life.

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:29.554
So I was thinking about my own life,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.467
and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,
