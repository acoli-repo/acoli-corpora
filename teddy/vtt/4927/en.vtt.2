00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.326
How does it work?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.676
And what can it do?

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.716
Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a 
natural process

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:10.402
that’s long functioned as a 
bacterial immune system.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:14.592
Originally found defending single-celled 
bacteria and archaea

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.512
against invading viruses,

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:20.512
naturally occurring CRISPR uses 
two main components.

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:24.662
The first are short snippets of 
repetitive DNA sequences

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:30.062
called “clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats,”
