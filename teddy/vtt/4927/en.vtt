00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.355
From the smallest single-celled organism

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:11.245
to the largest creatures on earth,

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:14.935
every living thing is defined 
by its genes.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:20.055
The DNA contained in our genes acts like
an instruction manual for our cells.

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:24.798
Four building blocks called bases are 
strung together in precise sequences,

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.758
which tell the cell how to behave

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:30.188
and form the basis for our every trait.
