00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.089
Like the viral RNA in the 
CRISPR immune system,

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:07.029
the guide RNA directs Cas9 
to the target gene,

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:11.029
and the protein’s molecular scissors 
snip the DNA.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.559
This is the key to CRISPR’s power:

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:19.149
just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short 
piece of custom guide RNA

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.393
scientists can edit practically 
any gene in the genome.

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:25.070
Once the DNA is cut,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.030
the cell will try to repair it.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.440
Typically, proteins called nucleases

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.940
trim the broken ends and 
join them back together.
