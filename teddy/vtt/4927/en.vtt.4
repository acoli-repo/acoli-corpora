00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:01.176
This molecule plays many roles 
in our cells,

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.806
but in the case of CRISPR,

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:07.106
RNA binds to a special protein 
called Cas9.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.211
The resulting complexes act like scouts,

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:13.431
latching onto free-floating 
genetic material

00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.061
and searching for a match to the virus.

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:20.561
If the virus invades again, the scout
complex recognizes it immediately,

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.743
and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:27.949
Lots of bacteria have this type 
of defense mechanism.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.709
But in 2012, scientists figured out 
how to hijack CRISPR
