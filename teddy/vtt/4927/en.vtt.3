00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:30.062
called “clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats,”

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:32.052
or simply, CRISPRs.

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:33.742
The second are Cas,

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.312
or “CRISPR-associated” proteins

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:40.012
which chop up DNA like molecular scissors.

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:42.622
When a virus invades a bacterium,

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:46.262
Cas proteins cut out a segment 
of the viral DNA

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.572
to stitch into the bacterium’s 
CRISPR region,

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:53.062
capturing a chemical snapshot 
of the infection.

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:58.162
Those viral codes are then copied 
into short pieces of RNA.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:01.176
This molecule plays many roles 
in our cells,
