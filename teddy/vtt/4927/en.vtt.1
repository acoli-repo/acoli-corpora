00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:30.188
and form the basis for our every trait.

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:33.188
But with recent advancements 
in gene editing tools,

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:37.998
scientists can change an organism’s
fundamental features in record time.

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.906
They can engineer drought-resistant crops

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.426
and create apples that don’t brown.

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.466
They might even prevent the spread 
of infectious outbreaks

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.506
and develop cures for genetic diseases.

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:53.726
CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and 
cheapest of the gene editing tools

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:56.996
responsible for this new wave of science.

00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:59.346
But where did this medical 
marvel come from?

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.326
How does it work?
