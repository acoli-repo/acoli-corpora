00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.940
trim the broken ends and 
join them back together.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.630
But this type of repair process,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.050
called nonhomologous end joining,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.330
is prone to mistakes

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.670
and can lead to extra or missing bases.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.830
The resulting gene is often unusable 
and turned off.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.402
However, if scientists add a separate 
sequence of template DNA

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:52.072
to their CRISPR cocktail,

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:56.282
cellular proteins can perform 
a different DNA repair process,

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:58.862
called homology directed repair.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:03.332
This template DNA is used as a blueprint 
to guide the rebuilding process,
