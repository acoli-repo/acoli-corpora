mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria,

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.614
or even reprogram drug-resistant 
cancer cells.

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:36.394
It’s also a powerful tool 
for studying the genome,

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:39.704
allowing scientists to watch 
what happens when genes are turned off

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:42.204
or changed within an organism.

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.104
CRISPR isn’t perfect yet.

00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:47.574
It doesn’t always make 
just the intended changes,

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:52.084
and since it’s difficult to predict the 
long-term implications of a CRISPR edit,

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:55.689
this technology raises 
big ethical questions.

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.359
It’s up to us to decide the 
best course forward

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:01.839
as CRISPR leaves single-celled 
organisms behind
