00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.709
But in 2012, scientists figured out 
how to hijack CRISPR

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.999
to target not just viral DNA,

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.849
but any DNA in almost any organism.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.249
With the right tools,

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.539
this viral immune system becomes a 
precise gene-editing tool,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.819
which can alter DNA and 
change specific genes

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.139
almost as easily as fixing a typo.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.939
Here’s how it works in the lab:

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.689
scientists design a “guide” RNA 
to match the gene they want to edit,

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.929
and attach it to Cas9.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.089
Like the viral RNA in the 
CRISPR immune system,
