This template DNA is used as a blueprint 
to guide the rebuilding process,

00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:04.971
repairing a defective gene

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:08.441
or even inserting a completely new one.

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.526
The ability to fix DNA errors

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:14.386
means that CRISPR could potentially 
create new treatments for diseases

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:19.176
linked to specific genetic errors, like 
cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.956
And since it’s not limited to humans,

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:23.896
the applications are almost endless.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:27.426
CRISPR could create plants 
that yield larger fruit,

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:30.086
mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria,
