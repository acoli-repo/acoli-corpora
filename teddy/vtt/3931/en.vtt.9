00:04:27.408 --> 00:04:32.155
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:35.487
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.838
or the next environmental worker

00:04:37.862 --> 00:04:41.060
sounding the alarm
about Flint's dirty water,

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.764
or a Wall Street insider

00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:44.965
warning us of the next financial crisis.

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.997
After all, these tools weren't just built
to help the brave men and women

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.559
who expose crimes,

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.817
but are meant to protect
all of our rights under the Constitution.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.611
Thank you.

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:59.944
