You see, under the First Amendment,

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:04.000
the press has the right to publish
secret information in the public interest.

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:09.158
But it's impossible to exercise that right
if the media can't also gather that news

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:12.438
and protect the identities
of the brave men and women

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.612
who get it to them.

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:16.119
So when the government came knocking,

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.184
Risen did what many brave reporters
have done before him:

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:20.393
he refused

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.088
and said he'd rather go to jail.

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.594
So from 2007 to 2015,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.412
Risen lived under the specter
of going to federal prison.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:33.023
That is, until just days before the trial,
when a curious thing happened.
