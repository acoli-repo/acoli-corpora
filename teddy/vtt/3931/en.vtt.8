00:03:59.748 --> 00:04:01.852
and much of the information

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:03.835
wouldn't be available in the first place.

SecureDrop, though, is really
only a small part of the puzzle

00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:10.410
for protecting press freedom
in the 21st century.

Unfortunately, governments

that put us all at risk.

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.741

to make sure

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:23.265

an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

00:04:27.408 --> 00:04:32.155
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower
