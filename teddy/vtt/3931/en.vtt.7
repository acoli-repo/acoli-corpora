that was originally created by the late
Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.477
and is now developed
at the non-profit where I work,

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.032
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:39.476
Instead of sending an email,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.541
you go to a news organization's website,

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.565
like this one here on The Washington Post.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.953

much like you would
on any other contact form.

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.334
It'll then be encrypted
and stored on a server

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.906
that only the news organization
has access to.

00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.724
So the government can no longer
secretly demand the information,

00:03:59.748 --> 00:04:01.852
and much of the information
they would demand
