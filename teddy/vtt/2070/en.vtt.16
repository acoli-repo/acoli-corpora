00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There is an extraordinary regularity.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So you tell me the size of a mammal,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And the reason for this is because of networks.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
All of life is controlled by networks --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
from the intracellular through the multicellular

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
through the ecosystem level.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And you're very familiar with these networks.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
If you take those networks,
