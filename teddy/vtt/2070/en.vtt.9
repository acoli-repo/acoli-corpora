00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
one of the most extraordinary things about life,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is that it is scalable,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it works over an extraordinary range.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This is just a tiny range actually:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It's us mammals;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
we're one of these.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The same principles, the same dynamics,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the same organization is at work

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in all of these, including us,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And that is one of the main reasons

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
life is so resilient and robust --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
scalability.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But you know, at a local level,
