00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It's the same plot.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This happens to be income and assets

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We could use sales, anything you like.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
when companies are innovating,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
they scale beautifully.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And we've looked at 23,000 companies

in the United States, may I say.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
What is astonishing about companies

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is that they scale sublinearly

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
like biology,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
indicating that they're dominated,
