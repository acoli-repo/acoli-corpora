00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
If you take those networks,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
this idea of networks,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and you apply universal principles,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
mathematizable, universal principles,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
all of these scalings

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and all of these constraints follow,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
including the description of the forest,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the description of your circulatory system,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the description within cells.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
was that, systematically, the pace of life

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
decreases as you get bigger.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Heart rates are slower; you live longer;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
diffusion of oxygen and resources
