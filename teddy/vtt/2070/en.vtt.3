00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
despite having this negative aspect to them,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
are also the solution.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that have sucked up creative people,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
creating ideas, innovation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
wealth and so on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we have this kind of dual nature.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so there's an urgent need

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
for a scientific theory of cities.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now these are my comrades in arms.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and they've done all the work,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and I'm the great bullshitter
