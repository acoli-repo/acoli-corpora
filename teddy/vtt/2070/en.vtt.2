00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
China's building 300 new cities

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in the next 20 years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now listen to this:

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Every week for the foreseeable future,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is going to be affected

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by what's happening in cities

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in this extraordinary phenomenon.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
However, cities,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
