00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That is, you ask any generic question about this --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how many trees of a given size,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
how many branches of a given size does a tree have,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
how many leaves,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
what is the energy flowing through each branch,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
what is the size of the canopy,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
what is its growth, what is its mortality?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We have a mathematical framework

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
based on generic universal principles

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that can answer those questions.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And the idea is can we do the same for this?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So the route in is recognizing

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
one of the most extraordinary things about life,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is that it is scalable,
