00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But you know, at a local level,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's called growth.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Here's how you grew.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We're all pretty much the same.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And you see, you're very familiar with this.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You grow very quickly and then you stop.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that line there

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is a prediction from the same theory,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
based on the same principles,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that describes that forest.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And here it is for the growth of a rat,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and those points on there are data points.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is just the weight versus the age.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And you see, it stops growing.
