00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
then systematically

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you get a 15 percent increase

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
number of police,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
anything you can think of.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It goes up by 15 percent,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and you have a 15 percent savings

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
on the infrastructure.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This, no doubt, is the reason

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
why a million people a week are gathering in cities.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Because they think that all those wonderful things --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
like creative people, wealth, income --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is what attracts them,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
forgetting about the ugly and the bad.
