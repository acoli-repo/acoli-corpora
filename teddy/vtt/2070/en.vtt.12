00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay, so how do we understand this?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So let's first talk about biology.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is explicitly showing you

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
how things scale,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and this is a truly remarkable graph.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What is plotted here is metabolic rate --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
how much energy you need per day to stay alive --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
versus your weight, your mass,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
for all of us bunch of organisms.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And what you see if you plot it
