00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
economies, energy --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
they're all problems

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that are confronted by having cities.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's where all these problems come from.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in terms of sustainability questions

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are actually a reflection

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of the exponential increase

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in urbanization across the planet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here's some numbers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Two hundred years ago, the United States

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
was less than a few percent urbanized.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's now more than 82 percent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
