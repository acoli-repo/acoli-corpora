00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
forgetting about the ugly and the bad.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
What is the reason for this?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but underlying this is the social networks,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
because this is a universal phenomenon.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
This 15 percent rule

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
is true

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
no matter where you are on the planet --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Japan, Chile,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Always, all the data shows it's the same,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Something universal is going on.
