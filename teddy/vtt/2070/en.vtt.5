00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the question is:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are going to look like in 2050,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or is it going to be this?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's the question.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I must say, many of the indicators

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
look like this is what it's going to look like,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but let's talk about it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So my provocative statement

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And scientific theory means quantifiable --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
relying on underlying generic principles

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that can be made into a predictive framework.
