00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is now given to you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
when you tell me its size.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The slope of that is less than linear.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
There is an economy of scale.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But here's what's surprising.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It scales in the same way everywhere.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
This is just European countries,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
always the same

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
with the same kind of economy of scale

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to the same degree.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And any infrastructure you look at --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --
