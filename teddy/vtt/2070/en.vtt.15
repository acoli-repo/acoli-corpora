00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you would require double the amount of energy.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is that, if you double the size of the organism,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you actually only need 75 percent more energy.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So a wonderful thing about all of biology

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The bigger you are systematically,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
according to very well-defined rules,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
less energy per capita.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Now any physiological variable you can think of,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
any life history event you can think of,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
if you plot it this way, looks like this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There is an extraordinary regularity.
