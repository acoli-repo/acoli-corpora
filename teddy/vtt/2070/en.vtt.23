00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
more patents per capita, more crime per capita.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And we've looked at everything:

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
more AIDS cases, flu, etc.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And here, they're all plotted together.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Just to show you what we plotted,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
here is income, GDP --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
GDP of the city --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
crime and patents all on one graph.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And you can see, they all follow the same line.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And here's the statement.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it doesn't matter,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
then systematically

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you get a 15 percent increase
