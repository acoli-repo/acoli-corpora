00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And the bottom one is you lot --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
super-creatives plotted in the same way.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And what you see

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
is a scaling phenomenon.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But most important in this,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
for the metabolic rate,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Here it is,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which says that the bigger you are

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the more you have per capita, unlike biology --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
more patents per capita, more crime per capita.
