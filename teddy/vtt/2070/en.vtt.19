00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Cities are just a physical manifestation

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of your interactions,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
our interactions,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and the clustering and grouping of individuals.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And here's scaling of cities.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
This shows that in this very simple example,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which happens to be a mundane example

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
of number of petrol stations

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
as a function of size --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
plotted in the same way as the biology --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
you see exactly the same kind of thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
There is a scaling.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is now given to you
