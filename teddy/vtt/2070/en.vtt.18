Heart rates are slower; you live longer;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
diffusion of oxygen and resources

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
across membranes is slower, etc.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The question is: Is any of this true

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
for cities and companies?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So is London a scaled up Birmingham,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Don't know. We will discuss that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But they are networks,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and the most important network of cities

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Cities are just a physical manifestation

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of your interactions,
