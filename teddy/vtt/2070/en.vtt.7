00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or is there serious substance to it?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And if that is the case,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
how come that it's very hard to kill a city?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You could drop an atom bomb on a city,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and 30 years later it's surviving.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Very few cities fail.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
All companies die, all companies.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when Google is going to go bust.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So is that just another version

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of this?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Well we understand this very well.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That is, you ask any generic question about this --
