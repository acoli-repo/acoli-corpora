00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that can be made into a predictive framework.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That's the quest.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Is that conceivable?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Are there universal laws?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So here's two questions

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that I have in my head when I think about this problem.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The first is:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Are cities part of biology?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Is London a great big whale?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Is Edinburgh a horse?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What do we learn from that?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We use them metaphorically --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or is there serious substance to it?
