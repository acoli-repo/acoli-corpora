00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
faster and faster and faster.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So the image

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000

We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
asking about companies.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
See companies, they scale.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It's the same plot.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This happens to be income and assets
