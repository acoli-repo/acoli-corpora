00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with its own unique history.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and natural selection,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
they've been constrained to lie on a line.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Something else is going on.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Before I talk about that,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I've written down at the bottom there

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the slope of this curve, this straight line.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's three-quarters, roughly,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And here's the point of that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It says that, if it were linear,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the steepest slope,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
then doubling the size

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you would require double the amount of energy.
