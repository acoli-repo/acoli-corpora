00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is just the weight versus the age.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And you see, it stops growing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Very, very good for biology --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
also one of the reasons for its great resilience.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Very, very bad

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
for economies and companies and cities

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in our present paradigm.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is what we believe.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is what our whole economy

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is thrusting upon us,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
hockey sticks.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is a bunch of software companies --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and what it is is their revenue versus their age --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
all zooming away,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
