00:10:27.603 --> 00:10:30.197
On one hand, when we insist
to entrepreneurs

00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:33.435
that failing fast is the only option,

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.935
it's possible that
we're promoting mediocrity --

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.976
that entrepreneurs
don't give their maximum effort,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.146
and that they give up when faced
with the most minor difficulty.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.986
I also think that when we talk
about failing fast,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.651
we're minimizing that negative impact
that closing a business has.

00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.306
Of course, I believe failing fast
is a great way to accelerate learning

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.992
and avoid wasting time.

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:58.896
But we can't deny
the negative consequences

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.289
that exist behind the death of a business.
