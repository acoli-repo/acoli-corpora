makes you stronger, not weaker.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.600
Actually, for me, it was like an exorcism.

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.682
It was like a weight was lifted off of me;

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:38.350
I had nothing to hide anymore.

00:04:38.374 --> 00:04:39.909
That night, I also realized

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:43.182
that being open to this new place
of my vulnerability

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:48.365
helped me connect with others
in a much deeper and authentic way.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.946
As a result of that experience,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.260
of sharing stories of businesses
that didn't work,

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:55.736
we decided to create an event series

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.926
so that other people
could also share their stories

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.586
of failed businesses.
