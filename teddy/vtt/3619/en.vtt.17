if it doesn't work?

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:40.746
Of course, this disincentivizes
the creation of new businesses

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.711
and promotes the informal economy.

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:46.556
In fact, econometric research has shown

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.626
that the less time and money needed
to close a business,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.440
