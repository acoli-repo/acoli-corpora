Remember that businesses are not entities
that magically appear and disappear.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.155
Businesses are made up of people.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:07.966
And if a business project fails,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.406
surely, some of those people
will lose their jobs

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.245
or lose money.

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.716
And in the case of social enterprises
or green businesses,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.125
when they fail,

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:21.476
surely the closing of the project
will have a negative impact

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.530
on the communities or ecosystems
they were intended to benefit.

00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:32.037
But what do I mean by "fail mindfully"?
