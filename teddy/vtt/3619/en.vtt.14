entrepreneurs recuperate

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.369
after the failure of our business.

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:06.846
For example, on the European continent,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.561
it's much more common
that entrepreneurs seek out a therapist

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.376
to recuperate emotionally.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.496
On the other hand,
on the American continent,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.893
the most common behavior
is to seek out education and training.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.904
is the profound impact that

00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:31.425
on the way in which entrepreneurs
decide to close their business
