that I had kept a secret
for so many years.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:04.679
To my surprise, my friends
had similar stories.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.886
And at that moment, something became
very clear in my mind:

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.366
I hung out with total failures!

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.364
(Laughter)

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:16.118
No, but seriously,

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:20.428
that day I realized
that we all have hidden failures.

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:22.125
Tell me if that's not true.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.816
(Audience responds)

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.746
That night, I realized
that sharing your failures publicly

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.445
makes you stronger, not weaker.
