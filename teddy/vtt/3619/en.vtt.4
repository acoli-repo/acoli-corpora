00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.885
In fact, sharing it took seven years,

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.066
a good amount of vulnerability

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.983
and the company of my friends.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.681
This is the story of my failure.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.077
When I was at college studying business,
I met a group of indigenous women

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.906
who lived in a very marginalized
rural community in Puebla,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.466
a state in the center of Mexico.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.687
They created beautiful handmade crafts.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.666
So when I met them
and became familiar with their work,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.586
I decided that I wanted to do
something to help them.
