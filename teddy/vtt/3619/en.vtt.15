00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:31.425
on the way in which entrepreneurs
decide to close their business

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.773
and recuperate from the experience.

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:36.638
For example, in my country, Mexico,

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:41.066
the regulatory framework
for closing a business is so strict

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.447
that closing a business
in compliance with the law

00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:47.235
can take too much time and too much money.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:49.513
Let's start with the money part.

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:53.476
If things go well, if your business
isn't involved in big problems,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.576
if you don't have any issues
with suppliers like outstanding debts,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.305
closing a business
will cost you US $2,000.
