on the life of the artisans,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.841
and I felt that I had actually had
a very negative impact.

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:38.949
I felt so guilty about what happened

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:43.604
that for years I hid it from my résumé
and from my conversations.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.696
Some time later, I was out
with some entrepreneur friends,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.788
and the topic of failure came up.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.374
I took the risk and confessed to them
the story of my failed business

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:00.957
that I had kept a secret
for so many years.
