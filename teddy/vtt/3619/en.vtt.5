00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.586
I decided that I wanted to do
something to help them.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.896
And I did everything
just like they had taught me

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.797
at business school back then:

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.398
I partnered with my friends;

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:40.890
we procured funding;

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:43.871
we spent a lot of time
building the business

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.013
and training the artisans.

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:50.008
But we soon realized that we were rookies.

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:53.671
The truth is, the crafts didn't sell --

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:57.649
or better yet, we didn't know
how to sell them --

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:01.403
and the business plan we had made
wasn't realistic.
