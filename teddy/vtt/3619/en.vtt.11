00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.383
to tell the story
of their failed business,

00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:32.976
it's not a cause for humiliation or shame,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.856
as it usually was in the past.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.106
Actually, it's an opportunity
to share lessons

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.786
and generate empathy.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.488
We've also found that when members
of the same team get together

00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:47.225
to share their stories of failure,

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.756
something magical happens:

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.826
collaboration becomes easier,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.843
and the bonds become stronger.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.866
In fact, over the course of
the events and the research,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.436
we've found surprising things.
