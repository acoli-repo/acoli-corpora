00:08:54.971 --> 00:09:00.607
So in 2017, we decided to present
a series of public policy recommendations

00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.345
for the law that governs
the closing of businesses.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:07.596
For a year, we worked with
the Association of Entrepreneurs

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.366
and with the Mexican congress,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.584
and the good news is
that we managed to change the law.

00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:17.070
(Applause)

00:09:20.806 --> 00:09:24.600
The idea is that once
the new legislation goes into effect,

00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:27.001
entrepreneurs will be able
to close their business

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:31.622
via an online process, which will be
much more accessible to everyone
