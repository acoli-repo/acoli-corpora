00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.167
With every fold we make,
the paper doubles in thickness.

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.063
And if we continue to fold
it again and again,

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:38.839
always in half, we would confront
the following situation

00:01:38.863 --> 00:01:39.976
after 10 folds.

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:42.827
Two to the power of 10,

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.415
meaning that you multiply
two by itself 10 times,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.968
is one thousand and
24 thousandths of a centimeter,

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:54.067
which is a little bit over one centimeter.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.254
Assume we continue folding
the paper in half.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.976
What will happen then?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
If we fold it 17 times,
