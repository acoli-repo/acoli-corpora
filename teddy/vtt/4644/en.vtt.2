If you could fold the paper over and over,
as many times as you wish,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.116
say 30 times,

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.155
what would you imagine
the thickness of the paper would be then?

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:08.730
Before you move on,

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.976
I encourage you to actually think
about a possible answer to this question.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.065
OK.

00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:17.150
After we have folded the paper once,

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:20.501
it is now two thousandths
of a centimeter in thickness.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.837
If we fold it in half once again,

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:26.976
the paper will become
four thousandths of a centimeter.

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.167
With every fold we make,
the paper doubles in thickness.
