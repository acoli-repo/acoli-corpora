00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.444
let's say you have a paper

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.551
that's one-thousandth
of a centimeter in thickness.

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.889
That is 10 to the power
of minus three centimeters,

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.220
which equals .001 centimeters.

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:46.362
Let's also assume that you have
a big piece of paper,

like a page out of the newspaper.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.679
Now we begin to fold it in half.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:55.181
How many times do you think
it could be folded like that?

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.084
And another question:

00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:01.795
If you could fold the paper over and over,
as many times as you wish,
