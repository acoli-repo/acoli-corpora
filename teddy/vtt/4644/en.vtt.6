00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.976
the thickness is almost
a quarter of a mile.

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:06.186
30 times, the thickness reaches 6.5 miles,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.916
which is about the average
height that planes fly.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.976
40 times, the thickness
is nearly 7,000 miles,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.851
or the average GPS satellite's orbit.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.427
48 times, the thickness
is way over one million miles.

00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:24.228
Now, if you think that the distance
between the Earth and the Moon

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:27.041
is less than 250,000 miles,

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.473
then starting with a piece of Bible paper

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.976
and folding it 45 times,
we get to the Moon.
