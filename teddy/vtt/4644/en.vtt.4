00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
If we fold it 17 times,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
we'll get a thickness
of two to the power of 17,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.719
which is 131 centimeters,

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.672
and that equals just over four feet.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.976
If we were able to fold it 25 times,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.976
then we would get two to the power of 25,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.263
which is 33,554 centimeters,

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.115
just over 1,100 feet.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.976
That would make it almost
as tall as the Empire State Building.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.976
It's worthwhile to stop here
and reflect for a moment.
