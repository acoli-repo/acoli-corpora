00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.976
It's worthwhile to stop here
and reflect for a moment.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:37.546
Folding a paper in half, even a paper
as fine as that of the Bible,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.976
25 times would give us a paper
almost a quarter of a mile.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.015
What do we learn?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.631
This type of growth
is called exponential growth,

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:49.976
and as you see, just by folding a paper

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.158
we can go very far, but very fast too.

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:58.709
Summarizing, if we fold a paper 25 times,

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.976
the thickness is almost
a quarter of a mile.
