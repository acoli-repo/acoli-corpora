00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So today, I want us to reflect

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on the demise of guys.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Guys are flaming out academically;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they're wiping out socially with girls

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and sexually with women.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So what's the data?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So the data on dropping out is amazing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to drop out of school.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Girls outperform boys now at every level,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from elementary school to graduate school.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a 10 percent differential

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,
