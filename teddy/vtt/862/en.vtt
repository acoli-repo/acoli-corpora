I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:08.539
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.842
creatures from a far-distant world.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:13.629
But basically, I figured out that I could find

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.606
those alien creatures right on Earth.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.259
And what I do is I study insects.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.515
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.656
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:28.398
one of the most important events in the history of life.

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:30.635
Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.
