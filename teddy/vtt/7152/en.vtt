00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.397
I'm so happy and proud to be here.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.097
When I told my husband
about this wonderful opportunity,

00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:12.363
he said, "TED Talk? Wow,
I get to do that a lot around here.

00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:14.330
It's finally someone else's turn."

00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:18.730
So, yes, I happen to be married
to a wonderful man named Ted,

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:21.497
which is pretty rare
in Finland, where I'm from.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.063
It's not a typical Finnish name
at all, trust me.

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:29.897
Myself, I'm a business professor,
and I love teaching.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.097
But you know what?
