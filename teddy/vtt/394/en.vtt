00:00:00.815 --> 00:00:02.867
So, a little while ago,

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.934
members of my family
had three bits of minor surgery,

00:00:05.958 --> 00:00:07.523
about a half hour each,

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.624
and we got three sets of bills.

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.237
For the first one, the anesthesia bill
alone was 2,000 dollars;

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.641
the second one, 2,000 dollars;

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.434
the third one, 6,000 dollars.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.189
So I'm a journalist.
I'm like, what's up with that?

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:28.096
I found out that I was actually,
for the expensive one,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.939
being charged 1,419 dollars
for a generic anti-nausea drug
