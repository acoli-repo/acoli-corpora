00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:01.471
Be really clear about this:

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:03.405
this is a United States problem.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:05.484
In most of the rest
of the developed world,

00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:08.267
sick people don't have
to worry about money.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.309
It's also true that price transparency
will not solve every problem.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.139
There will still be expensive treatments,

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:17.855
huge friction from our insurance system.

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.559
There will still be fraud

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:22.954
and a massive problem
with overtreatment and overdiagnosis.

00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:26.152
And not everything is shoppable.

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:28.630
Not everybody wants
the cheapest appendectomy

00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:30.505
or the cheapest cancer care.
