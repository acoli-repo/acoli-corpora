00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:03.928
help us solve this problem that's hurting
them and their friends and families.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:06.928
We talked to people who had
to sell a car to pay a health bill,

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:08.339
go into bankruptcy,

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:10.636
skip a treatment because of the cost.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.890
Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:15.430
but not the cure.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.751
We set off a huge conversation about costs

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:23.526
involving doctors and hospitals, yes,
but also their patients,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.741
or as we like to call them, people.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.669
(Laughter)

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.670
We changed policy.
