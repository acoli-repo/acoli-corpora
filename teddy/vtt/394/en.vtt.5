Then we started to ask people
to tell us their health bills.

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:44.265
In partnership with public radio station
WNYC here in New York,

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.221
we asked women to tell us

00:02:57.272 --> 00:03:00.356
Then we started to make it easier
for people to share their data
