00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:30.748
instead of the $522 one?

00:06:31.384 --> 00:06:33.122
Would our individual bills go down?

00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.549
Our premiums?

00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:37.421
I don't know, but if you don't ask,
you'll never know.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.315
And you might save a ton of money.

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:43.306
And I've got to think that a lot of us
and the system itself

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.912
would be a lot healthier.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:46.864
Thank you.

00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:50.716
