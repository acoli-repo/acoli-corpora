A San Francisco contributor
saved nearly 1,300 dollars

00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:42.283
by putting away his insurance card

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:43.757
and paying cash.

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:47.541
There are a lot of people
who are going to in-network hospitals

and getting out-of-network bills.

00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:53.047

that continued to bill a dead man.

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.223

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.634
find out how to argue a bill,

00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:03.928
help us solve this problem that's hurting
them and their friends and families.
