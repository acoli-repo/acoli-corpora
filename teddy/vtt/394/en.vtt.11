00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:30.505
or the cheapest cancer care.

00:05:31.513 --> 00:05:33.668
But when we talk
about these clear effects,

00:05:33.692 --> 00:05:37.219
we're looking at a real issue
that's actually very simple.

00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:40.348
When we first started calling for prices,

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:42.851
we actually felt like
we were going to be arrested.

00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:46.754
It seemed kind of transgressive
to talk about medicine and health care

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:48.123
in the same breath,

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.699
and yet it became liberating,

00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:52.035
because we found not only data

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.700
but also good and honest people
out there in the system

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:56.868
who want to help folks
get the care they need

00:05:56.892 --> 00:05:58.310
at a price they can afford.

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.506
And it got easier to ask.
