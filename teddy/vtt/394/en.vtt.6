00:02:57.272 --> 00:03:00.356
Then we started to make it easier
for people to share their data

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.082
into our online searchable database.

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:08.244
It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak.com
and the Waze traffic app for health care.

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:09.317
(Laughter)

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.248
We call it a community-created
guide to health costs.

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:14.907
Our survey and crowdsourcing work
grew into partnerships

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:16.797
with top newsrooms nationwide --

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.893
in New Orleans, Philadelphia,

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:22.628
San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Miami and other places.

00:03:23.212 --> 00:03:27.135
We used the data to tell stories
about people who were suffering

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.979
and how to avoid that suffering,
to avoid that "gotcha" bill.
