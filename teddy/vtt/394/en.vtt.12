00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.506
And it got easier to ask.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.611
So I'll leave you with some questions.

00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:06.964
What if we all knew what stuff cost
in health care in advance?

00:06:07.983 --> 00:06:11.170
What if, every time
you Googled for an MRI,

00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:14.594
you got drop-downs telling you
where to buy and for how much,

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:17.075
the way you do when
you Google for a laser printer?

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:22.338
What if all of the time and energy
and money that's spent hiding prices

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:24.346
was squeezed out of the system?

00:06:25.188 --> 00:06:28.387
What if each one of us could pick
the $19 test every time

00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:30.748
instead of the $522 one?
