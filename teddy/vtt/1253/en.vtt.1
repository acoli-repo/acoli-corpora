00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:30.904
in all of the presentations that we've had

00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:32.880
and in all of the people here;

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.555
just the variety of it
and the range of it.

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:38.301
The second is that it's put us in a place

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.822
where we have no idea
what's going to happen

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:42.237
in terms of the future.

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.246
No idea how this may play out.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.892
I have an interest in education.

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:51.328
Actually, what I find is,
everybody has an interest in education.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.669
Don't you?

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:54.095
I find this very interesting.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:58.077
If you're at a dinner party,
and you say you work in education --

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.846
actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.
