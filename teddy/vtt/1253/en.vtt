Good morning. How are you?

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:06.105
(Audience) Good.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.797

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.729
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.245
In fact, I'm leaving.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.175
(Laughter)

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:21.663
There have been three themes
running through the conference,

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.973
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:28.467
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:30.904
in all of the presentations that we've had
