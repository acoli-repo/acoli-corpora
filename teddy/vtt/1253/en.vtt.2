00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.846
actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.666
(Laughter)

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.118
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:10.321
(Laughter)

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:14.304
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.544
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:18.346
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.058
and you say you work in education,

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.131
you can see the blood run from their face.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:23.840
They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:26.140
(Laughter)

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.688
"My one night out all week."

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.322
(Laughter)
