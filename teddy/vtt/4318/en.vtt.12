It turns out,

00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:05.824

Corals, along with most other
organisms on this planet,

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.203
have their own protective
communities as well.

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:16.679
However, rather than keeping theirs
on the inside as we do in our gut,

00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:20.605
they keep theirs on the outside,

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.935
So what you're seeing here
is a three-dimensional image

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:28.292
of a live spot on a living coral
with all of its living bacteria,

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:30.419
that I took with some
