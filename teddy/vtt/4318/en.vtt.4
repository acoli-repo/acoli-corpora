00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.906
Thank the trees.

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:04.291
Take another deep breath in.

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:06.719
Thank the macroalgae.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.817
Your next two breaths --
tip your hats to the microbes.

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.674
This picture is of a bacterium

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.878
that happens to be the single most
abundant photosynthesizer

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.070
on our planet.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:19.788
It's called, "Prochlorococcus,"

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:25.603
and this is oceans' oxygen-producing
powerhouse and, I might argue,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:29.397
one of the most amazing discoveries
of recent marine microbiology.
