when it comes to making decisions
and policies about our oceans.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:37.560
When you look out on a clear blue ocean,

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:41.610
you're actually gazing at
a microbial soup full of vibrant life.

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:45.435
What you see here
are marine bacteria buzzing about

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:48.073
and exploring other members
of the marine food web.

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:51.463
To emphasize how small
this world really is,

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.314
I've added a white line
to most of my slides

00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:59.708
that shows you the thickness
of a single strand of human hair --

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:00.890
very tiny.
