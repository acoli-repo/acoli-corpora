00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:02.421
And those bacteria are sitting
in a mucus layer,

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:05.527
which is also part
of the coral's protective layer.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:07.449
From the bigger perspective,

00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:09.928
I spend my time thinking
about these relationships,

00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:13.557
because too many reefs are going
from looking like the picture on your left

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.010
to the picture on your right.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.195
Believe it or not,

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:19.761
the picture on your right remains
a very popular tourist snorkeling spot

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:20.992
on the island of Maui,

00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:24.637
even though it's lost most of its coral
cover over the past decade or so.

00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:27.695
Corals are getting sick
all around the globe at alarming rates,

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.960
and we really don't know how or why.
