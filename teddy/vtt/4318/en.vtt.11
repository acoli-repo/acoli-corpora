They are the invisible engineers
that control the chemistry of the ocean

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.111
and therefore, what creatures
can live there,

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:35.440
whether or not it's safe
for us to swim there

00:05:35.464 --> 00:05:38.033
and all of the other
characteristics we sense

00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:40.232
with our eyes, noses and taste buds.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.656
And the more we pay attention

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.733
to these small but very numerous
members of the ocean,

00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:48.372
the more we're learning
they do indeed respond to human actions,

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:50.487
such as in this fish farm example.

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:53.844
Now, as the past few slides
about coral reefs may have suggested,

00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:56.478
I do indeed spend much
of my time as a researcher

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:59.041
thinking about human-microbe interactions,

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:00.617
specifically on coral reefs.
