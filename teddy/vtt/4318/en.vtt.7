Our relationship with the ocean,
much like our gut,

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.537
is dependent on the right
balance of microbes.

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:38.477
The old phrase, "You are what you eat"
applies to our ocean microbes as well.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:42.054
To give you a sense of what
an overfed ocean may look like,

00:03:42.078 --> 00:03:44.611
here are two examples
of me sampling seawater.

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:47.736
On your left, it's a clean coral reef,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.677
and on your right is
a nearly dead coral reef

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:54.593
that has a very intense fish farming
operation in the waters there.

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:58.693
You'll notice I'm only smiling
in one of these two pictures,

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:02.466
and in the other one my dive buddy
had to be a whole lot closer
