But luckily, we rarely get sick
from that seawater,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.345
because most marine microbes
are working for us,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.564
not against us.

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:38.876
One of my favorite examples
is that they provide

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.658
half of the oxygen we breathe.

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.788
In middle school, we all learn
to thank the trees.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:47.348
And admittedly, they may be
more huggable than the microbes.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.344
But it turns out
that land plants only create

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.401
a quarter of the oxygen we breathe.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:55.401
Another quarter comes
from macroalgae like kelp

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.340
and a full 50% from the microbes.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.712
Take a deep breath in.
