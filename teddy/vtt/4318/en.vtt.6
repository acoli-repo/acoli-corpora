00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.146
We've all experienced the wrath
of unhappy gut microbes

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.493
at one point or another,

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.022
perhaps food poisoning or tainted water.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:10.240
But we may be less aware of the connection
we have with marine microbes

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:15.450
and the physical discomforts we can feel
when those communities change.

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:19.828
As an extreme example: the disease
cholera is caused by a bacterium

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:21.500
that thrives in the ocean.

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.203
So while most marine microbes
are indeed helping us,

00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:27.158
there do remain plenty that are not.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.967
Our relationship with the ocean,
much like our gut,
