00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.974
We didn't know it existed until 1988.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:36.185
All of human history has depended
on this little microbe

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.085
for the oxygen they breathe every day,
no matter where or when they lived.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.265
And we've only been aware
of that relationship for a mere 24 years.

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.979
I find that astounding.

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.567
How many more critical
relationships are out there

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.075
that we have yet to discover?

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.225
I see our relationship with marine
microbes as parallel in many ways

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.056
to the relationship we have
with microbes in our gut.

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.146
We've all experienced the wrath
of unhappy gut microbes
