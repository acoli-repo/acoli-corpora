00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:03.536
In the next ten minutes,
we will immerse ourselves

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.143
in an amazing and beautiful marine world

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.874
that's very often overlooked.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.868
I'd like to take you
on a journey into the sea,

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:14.476
looking at it from the perspective
of its smallest inhabitants:

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.868
the microbes.

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:18.292
My goal is that after this short journey,

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:22.349
you'll share my amazement
at how deeply connected our lives are

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.175
to these microscopic creatures

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.372
and also perhaps my concern

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:29.164
that these relationships
are often neglected

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:32.753
when it comes to making decisions
and policies about our oceans.
