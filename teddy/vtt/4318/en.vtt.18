00:08:55.293 --> 00:09:02.217
Another example of how I'm doing this
is by using microfluidics

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:06.491
to study specifically how pathogens
behave in the ocean.

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:08.956
The basic idea behind microfluidics

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.677
is that you can use
nanofabrication techniques

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.790
to recreate or mimic
the conditions bacteria experience

00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:18.422
at their own tiny scale in the ocean.

00:09:18.446 --> 00:09:23.434
What you see here is a microfluidic
chamber on a microscope slide

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:26.069
with a microscope lens underneath it.

00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:30.497
We use high-speed video microscopy
to record bacteria behavior.
