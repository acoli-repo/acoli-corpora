breakthroughs in technology,

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:32.020
such as with this fast confocal,

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.784
to make similar observations.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:38.763
I work to find ways that cutting-edge
technologies like this

00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:41.341
can help make the unseen seeable,

00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:45.577
to see marine bacteria in action
and learn how they behave.

00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:48.876
In doing so, we can learn how they respond

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.535
to our actions and our behaviors
and the environment around them

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:55.269
in ways that will help us
better manage our oceans.

00:08:55.293 --> 00:09:02.217
Another example of how I'm doing this
is by using microfluidics
