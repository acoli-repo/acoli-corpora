00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:00.890
very tiny.

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:05.923
An average teaspoon of clean seawater
has five million bacteria

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:08.006
and 50 million viruses in it.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.292
If I were to scoop up
two gallons of seawater,

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:13.787
there would be more bacteria
in those two gallons

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.051
than there are people on this planet.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.939
Take just a moment and think about

00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:21.028
how many gallons might make up an ocean.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.799
Or maybe I've already made
your stomach turn,

00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:27.123
as you think of all of the seawater
we've each accidentally swallowed

00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:28.373
over the years.

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.375
But luckily, we rarely get sick
from that seawater,
