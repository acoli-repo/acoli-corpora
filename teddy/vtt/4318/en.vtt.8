00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:02.466
and in the other one my dive buddy
had to be a whole lot closer

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.697
to capture that image.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:09.115
So if we were to take a drop of seawater
from each of these samples

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.859
and put it under the microscope,

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:14.071
this is what the bacteria and viral
communities would look like.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:17.803
So again, clean reef on your left,
fish farm reef on your right.

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:21.640
As we all have had a feeling of discomfort

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:24.150
from imbalanced gut microbes,

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:26.384
a fish swimming through
a part of the ocean

00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:28.173
that has been overfed in this way --

00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:31.388
in this case, by intense aquaculture,
but it could be a sewage spill
