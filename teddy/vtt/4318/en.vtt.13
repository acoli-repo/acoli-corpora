00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:30.419
that I took with some
exciting technology --

00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:33.909
a high-speed laser-scanning
confocal microscope.

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:37.018
All of the red circles
are the symbiotic algae

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:39.005
that live inside the coral tissue,

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.683
turning sunlight and into sugars
they both can use,

00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:47.455
and all of the little blue dots
are the protective bacteria.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.272
So when I use image analysis software

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:54.552
to highlight the outer layer
of the coral in white,

00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:57.491
you can see that there are still
some tiny little blue dots

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:59.071
above that layer.

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:02.421
And those bacteria are sitting
in a mucus layer,
