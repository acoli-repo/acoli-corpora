00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:01.946
We're looking at a side view
of the same coral as before,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.234
where the protective layer
meets the seawater;

00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:05.849
so, seawater on your right,

00:08:05.873 --> 00:08:07.105
coral on your left.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:11.522
It's incredibly exciting to me
that we can finally see these bacteria

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:15.359
in real life, in real time,
at their micro scale,

00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:18.316
and learn how they interact
with the world around them.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.841
Ecologists all over the world
are used to being able

00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:22.209
to grab a pair of binoculars

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:25.571
and go out and observe
what their study creatures do each day.

00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:28.405
But microbial ecologists
have desperately needed

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:30.023
breakthroughs in technology,
