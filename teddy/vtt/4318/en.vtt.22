that the healthy microbes on the coral
can fight off the pathogen

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.759
if the conditions are right.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.502
So, one final image of a coral
and its healthy bacteria.

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:11.828
I hope you've enjoyed this short journey
into our microbial oceans

00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:14.133
and that the next time you
look out at the sea,

00:11:14.157 --> 00:11:17.429
you'll take in a deep breath
of fresh ocean air and wonder:

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:20.200
What else are all
of the unseen microbes doing

00:11:20.224 --> 00:11:22.230
to keep us and our oceans healthy?

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:23.951
Thank you.
