If you take one idea away
from my talk today, let it be this:

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:09.922
we have an incredibly important
relationship with these marine microbes

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.442
that have very large-scale consequences,

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.813
and we're just barely
beginning to understand

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:16.555
what that relationship looks like

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.172
and how it may be changing.

00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:22.673
Just as a physician will have trouble
curing a disease of unknown cause,

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.295
we will have similar trouble
restoring ocean health

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.401
without understanding the microbes better.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:30.909
They are the invisible engineers
that control the chemistry of the ocean
