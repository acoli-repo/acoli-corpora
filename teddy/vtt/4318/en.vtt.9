00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:31.388
in this case, by intense aquaculture,
but it could be a sewage spill

00:04:31.412 --> 00:04:34.623
or fertilizer runoff or any number
of other sources --

00:04:34.647 --> 00:04:36.907
that fish will feel
the physical discomforts

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.377
of the ocean microbes being out of whack.

00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.491
There may be less oxygen present,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.471
there may be more pathogens there,

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.403
and there may be toxins
produced by some of these microbes.

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:50.688
The bottom line is that
from their tiny-scale existence,

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.915
these tiny microbes have
a very large-scale power

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.981
to control how our ocean smells,

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.235
how it tastes,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.451
how it feels

00:04:58.475 --> 00:04:59.801
and how it looks.
