00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.274
and they swim quickly
over in that direction and stay there.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.523
Up until now, it was thought

00:10:03.547 --> 00:10:07.690
that a pathogen would need some good luck
to find its host in the ocean.

00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:11.873
But simply by watching
and observing, we can learn

00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:15.565
that these bacteria are very well adapted
to seeking out their victims.

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:19.540
These micro-channels are bringing
us closer than ever before

00:10:19.564 --> 00:10:22.894
to understanding how bacteria
navigate that big blue ocean.

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:29.015
It turns out that this pathogen
can even detect the coral mucus

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.818
when I dilute it 20,000 fold.
