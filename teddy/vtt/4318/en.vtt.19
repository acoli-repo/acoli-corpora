We use high-speed video microscopy
to record bacteria behavior.

00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:33.610
The colored tubing is where
bacteria and seawater flow

00:09:33.634 --> 00:09:35.013
in and out of the device.

00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:38.993
And it's using a device like this
that I recently discovered

00:09:39.017 --> 00:09:42.062
that a known coral pathogen
actually has the ability

00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:44.982
to sniff around the seawater
and hunt for corals.

00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:48.624
Here's the video of in action.

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:53.403
You'll see all of the pathogens
which are the tiny green dots on the left

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:57.196
start detecting the coral mucus I put
on the right side of the channel,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.274
and they swim quickly
over in that direction and stay there.
