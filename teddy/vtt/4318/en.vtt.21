00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.818
when I dilute it 20,000 fold.

00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:38.509
So these bacteria are very well adapted
to hunting down these corals.

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:42.353
I'm currently testing
different environmental conditions

00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:46.510
to see what scenarios make
this pathogen more or less capable

00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:47.887
of hunting corals.

00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.550
By learning more
about what triggers the hunt,

00:10:50.574 --> 00:10:52.201
we should be able to find ways

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:54.717
to help slow down or prevent this disease.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.998
There's also some evidence

00:10:57.022 --> 00:11:01.999
that the healthy microbes on the coral
can fight off the pathogen
