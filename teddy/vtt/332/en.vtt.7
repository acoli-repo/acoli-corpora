00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
This would mean that no one in the city
has ever had contact with the disease.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
No one has natural defenses against,
nor been vaccinated against measles.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.420
If one day, a person sick with the measles
appears in this city

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.510
the disease won't find much resistance

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.440
and will begin spreading
from person to person,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.500
and in no time it will disseminate
throughout the community.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.530
After a certain time

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.900
a big part of the population will be ill.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.910
This happened when there were no vaccines.
