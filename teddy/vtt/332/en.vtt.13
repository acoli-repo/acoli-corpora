00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.360
to be protected against diseases.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.200
To achieve this effect of herd immunity,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.870
it is necessary that a large percentage
of the population be vaccinated.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.570
This percentage is called the threshold.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.330
The threshold depends on many variables:

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.740
It depends on the germ's characteristics,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.040
and those of the immune response
that the vaccine generates.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.430
But they all have something in common.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.640
If the percentage of the population
in a vaccinated community
