00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.910
This happened when there were no vaccines.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.110
Now, imagine the complete opposite case.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.830
We are in a city

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.650
where more than 90 percent
of the population

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.100
has defenses against
the measles, which means

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.839
that they either had the disease,
survived, and developed natural defenses;

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.540
or that they had been
immunized against measles.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.810
If one day,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.740
a person sick with the measles
appears in this city,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.610
the disease will find much more resistance
