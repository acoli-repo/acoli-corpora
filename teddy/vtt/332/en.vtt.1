After discussing the case in the room
and after a quite distressing catharsis,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.509
I remember my chief resident said to me,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.850
"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.050
And now comes the hardest part:

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.460
We have to go talk to her parents."

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.120
At that time, a thousand questions
came to mind,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.450
from, "How could a one-month-old
baby be so unfortunate?"

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.070
to, "Could we have done
something about it?"

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.680
Before vaccines existed,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.550
many infectious diseases
killed millions of people per year.
