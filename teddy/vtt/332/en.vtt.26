A year later,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.520
when a vaccine against the pandemic
H1N1 virus became available,

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.240
we wanted to see what happened.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.410
After a huge vaccination campaign

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.180
aimed at protecting at-risk groups,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:25.140
these hospitals, with 93 percent
of the at-risk groups vaccinated,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.770
had not hospitalized a single patient

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.450
for the pandemic H1N1 virus.
