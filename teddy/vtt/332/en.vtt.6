Have you ever wondered
who we are protecting

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.640
when we vaccinate?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.700
What do I mean by that?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.670
Is there any other effect
beyond protecting ourselves?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.170
Let me show you something.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.220
Imagine for a moment

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.230
that we are in a city

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.480
that has never had a case
of a particular disease,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.180
such as the measles.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
This would mean that no one in the city
has ever had contact with the disease.
