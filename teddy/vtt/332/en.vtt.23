00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.420
First thing Monday morning,
we took the car

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.350
and went to a hospital
in Buenos Aires Province,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:39.020
that served as a referral hospital
for cases of the new influenza virus.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.550
We arrived at the hospital;
it was crowded.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.470
All health staff were dressed
in NASA-like bio-safety suits.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.670
We all had face masks in our pockets.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.400
I, being a hypochondriac,
didn't breathe for two hours.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.520
But we could see what was happening.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.210
Immediately, we started
reaching out to pediatricians

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.430
from six hospitals in the city
and in Buenos Aires Province.
