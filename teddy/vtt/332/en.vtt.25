00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.500
We could see which children
got more seriously ill:

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.120
children under four, especially those
less than one year old;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.920
patients with neurological diseases;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.210
and young children
with chronic pulmonary diseases.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.020
Identifying these at-risk groups
was important

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.730
to include them as priority groups

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.730
in the recommendations
for getting the influenza vaccine,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.590
not only here in Argentina,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.650
but also in other countries
which the pandemic not yet reached.
