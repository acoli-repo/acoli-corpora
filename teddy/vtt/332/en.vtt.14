00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.640
If the percentage of the population
in a vaccinated community

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.050
is below this threshold number,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.110
the disease will begin
to spread more freely

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.780
and may generate an outbreak
of this disease within the community.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.860
Even diseases which were 
at some point controlled may reappear.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.740
This is not just a theory.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.100
This has happened,
and is still happening.
