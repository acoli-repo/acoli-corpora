00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.550
many infectious diseases
killed millions of people per year.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.630
During the 1918 flu pandemic

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.780
50 million people died.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.060
That's greater than Argentina's
current population.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.110
Perhaps, the older ones among you
remember the polio epidemic

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.030
that occurred in Argentina in 1956.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.560
At that time, there was no vaccine
available against polio.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.090
People didn't know what to do.
They were going crazy.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.370
They would go painting trees
with caustic lime.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.940
They'd put little bags of camphor

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.460
in their children's underwear,
as if that could do something.
