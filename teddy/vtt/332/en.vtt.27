00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.450
for the pandemic H1N1 virus.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.500
(Applause)

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.880
In 2009: 251.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.440
In 2010: zero.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.220
Vaccination is an act
of individual responsibility,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.250
but it has a huge collective impact.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.410
If I get vaccinated,
not only am I protecting myself,

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.630
but I am also protecting others.
