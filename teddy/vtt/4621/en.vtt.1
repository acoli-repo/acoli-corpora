00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.956
And it's that long history
of collaboration

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.638
that, to me, makes it
a very perfect object.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:38.349
The story of the pencil
starts with graphite.

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:41.290
People started finding
really useful applications

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:42.925
for this new substance.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.107
They cut it into small sticks

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.599
and wrapped it in string

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.797
to be used for writing or for drawing

00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:54.313

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:55.996

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.263
Over in France,

00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:01.441
Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method
of grinding the graphite,
