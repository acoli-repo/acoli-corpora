Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method
of grinding the graphite,

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.584
mixing it with powdered clay
and water to make a paste.

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:07.777
From there, this paste was filled
into a mold and fired in a kiln,

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.751
and the result was
a really strong graphite core

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.894
that wasn't breakable,
that was smooth, usable --

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:17.014
it was so much better than anything else
that existed at the time,

00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:20.848
and to this day, that's the method
that's still used in making pencils.

00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:24.588
Meanwhile, over in America,
in Concord, Massachusetts,

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:27.660
it was Henry David Thoreau
who came up with the grading scale

00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:29.770
for different hardnesses of pencil.

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:31.717
It was graded one through four,
