00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.948
when American stationer
Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:32.354
with an attached eraser,

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:34.250
which really changed the pencil game.

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:38.359
The world's first yellow pencil
was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500.

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:39.888
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.825
where they painted this pencil
with 14 coats of yellow paint

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.782
and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:47.016
There is a pencil for everyone,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.447
and every pencil has a story.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:54.425
The Blackwing 602 is famous
for being used by a lot of writers,

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.409
especially John Steinbeck
and Vladimir Nabokov.

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:00.037
And then, you have
the Dixon pencil company.
