00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:00.037
And then, you have
the Dixon pencil company.

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:02.998
They're responsible
for the Dixon Ticonderoga.

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:04.173
It's an icon,

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:06.724
it's what people think of
when they think of a pencil

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:09.171
and what they think of
when they think of school.

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.409
And the pencil's really
a thing that, I think,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.910
the average user
has never thought twice about,

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.079
how it's made or why it's made
the way it is,

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.047
because it's just always been that way.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.284
In my opinion, there's nothing
that can be done

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:23.172
to make the pencil better than it is.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.417
It's perfect.
