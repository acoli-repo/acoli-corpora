The sound is a really big part, I think,
of the experience of using a pencil,

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:07.064
and it has this really
audible scratchiness.

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:09.290
(Scratching)

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:12.806

the Pencil]

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.926
The pencil is a very simple object.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.435
It's made of wood
with some layers of paint

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:22.975
an eraser and a core,

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.395
which is made out of graphite,
clay and water.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.951
Yeah, it took hundreds
of people over centuries

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.651
to come to this design.

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.956
And it's that long history
of collaboration
