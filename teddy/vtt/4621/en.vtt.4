00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:00.440
for being one of the first people
to start developing actual machines

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.371
to do things like cut wood slats,
cut grooves into the wood,

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:05.604
apply glue to them ...

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:08.439
And they figured out
it was easier and less wasteful

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:10.091
to do a hexagonal pencil,

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:11.973
and so that became the standard.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:14.121
Since the early days of pencils,

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.617
that were used
to scratch away pencil marks

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.210
and later, rubber and pumice.

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:26.967
The attached eraser happened in 1858,

00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.948
when American stationer
Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil
