It was graded one through four,

00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:35.392
number two being the ideal
hardness for general use.

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:37.966
The softer the pencil,
the more graphite it had in it,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.355
and the darker and smoother
the line will be.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.782
The firmer the pencil,
the more clay it had in it

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:45.816
and the lighter and finer it will be.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.774
Originally, when pencils were handmade,
they were made round.

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:51.472
There was no easy way to make them,

00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:54.758
and it was the Americans
who really mechanized the craft.

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.728
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon

00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:00.440
for being one of the first people
to start developing actual machines
