Brandon shared the story
of a young man from Brownsville

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.739
who had witnessed violence firsthand,

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:41.502
by witnessing a man
being thrown off of a roof.

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:45.703
Yet he can still
be influenced by a principal

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:49.204
who had opened up a school
that believes in all children.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.095
Vidal embodies the story of so many
of our underprivileged children

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.230
who are struggling to survive,

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.650
which is why we must
make education a priority.
