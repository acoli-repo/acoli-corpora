00:00:55.416 --> 00:01:01.142
the founding principal of a middle school
that was a district public school,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.855
and I only had 45 kids to start.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.540
Thirty percent of them had special needs.

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:12.838
Eighty-six percent of them
were below grade level

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:14.884
in English and in math.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.971
And 100 percent were living
below the poverty level.

00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:24.567
If our children are not in our classrooms,

00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.937
how will they learn?

00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:28.505
And if they're not learning,

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.231
where would they end up?
