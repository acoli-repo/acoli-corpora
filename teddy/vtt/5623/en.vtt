Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth.

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.927
With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts,

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:18.231
there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.841
If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.566
But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening:

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.434
soap and water, and hand sanitizer.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.014
So which is better?
