00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
but you think of him as a mom.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and you see how they could be familiar to you.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
