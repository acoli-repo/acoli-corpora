00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but they are acting selfish and pathetic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and gives me a teaching or something

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And he left in disgust.
