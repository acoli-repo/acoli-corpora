00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and wishes to share it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free
