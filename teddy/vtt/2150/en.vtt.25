if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
