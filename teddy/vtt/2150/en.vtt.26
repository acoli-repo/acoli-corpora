00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
when they are satisfied.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but when they're happy they look beautiful.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And so you see beings in their potential happiness.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
