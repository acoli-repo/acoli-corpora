So as he comes up from his first bow he says,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
What is this?"

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Laughter)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.
