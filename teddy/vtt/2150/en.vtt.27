And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We think Jesus is being unrealistic

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
when he says, "Love thine enemy."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But, actually, that's practical.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
How boring to run around chasing you.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
