00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And we see the mother in every being.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We see that look that the mother has on her face,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
looking at this child that is a miracle

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in spiritual traditions.
