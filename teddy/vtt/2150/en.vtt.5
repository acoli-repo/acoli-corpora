Now, I want to tell a story,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of the great Saint Asanga

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but they are acting selfish and pathetic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
