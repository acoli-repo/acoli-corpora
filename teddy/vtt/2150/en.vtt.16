00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
shouting that the future Buddha had come.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So, naturally, they chased him out of town.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
