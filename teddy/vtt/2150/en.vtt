I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a part limited in time and space.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as something separated from the rest,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
