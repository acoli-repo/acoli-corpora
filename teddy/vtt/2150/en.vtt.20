00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the way the Buddhists reflect.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
are part of the eternal mother.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So, in that sense, we're related.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So, they first create this foundation of equality.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.
