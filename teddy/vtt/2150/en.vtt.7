00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And he left in disgust.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And as he was leaving, he saw a man --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And he had a lump of iron.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And he became interested in that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
He said, "Well what are you doing?"

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.
