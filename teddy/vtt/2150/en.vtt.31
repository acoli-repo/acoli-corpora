00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and you have compassion for yourself also,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
being more and more mean to other people

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
by dying, but they don't.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Never mind. I won't get into that.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."
