00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
hopefully will be more practical

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
he wanted to help.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and you have compassion for yourself also,
