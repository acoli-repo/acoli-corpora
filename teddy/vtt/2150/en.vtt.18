The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
