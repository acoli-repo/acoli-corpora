00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This time, he comes down.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Another three years.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
