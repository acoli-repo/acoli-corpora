00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
