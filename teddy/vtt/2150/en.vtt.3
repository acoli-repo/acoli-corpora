The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
