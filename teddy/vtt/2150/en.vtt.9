00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Another three years.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to see any encouraging vision.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
even in America, I think, in some areas --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and he's looking just terrible.
