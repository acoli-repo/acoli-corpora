Never mind. I won't get into that.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
must lead us to develop through true compassion,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
we are responsible for that, and we should take it

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and do whatever we can at whatever little level
