00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.855
In terms of invention,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.738
I'd like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects.

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:08.055
I think it's one of the most exciting
that I'm working on,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.800
but I think it's also the simplest.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.616
It's a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.056
It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.092
the number one cause of death
in children under five.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.840
Which is ...?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.760
Water-borne diseases?
Diarrhea? Malnutrition?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.400
No.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.496
It's breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires --
