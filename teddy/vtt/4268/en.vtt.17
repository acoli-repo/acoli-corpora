I still remember, though,
when I left my parents' home

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.640
to move across the country
to start this new job at Microsoft.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.360
They had sacrificed a lot
to give me five years of higher education.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.696
But they said, as I left home --

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.056
and I literally went down the front steps,
down the porch at home --

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.296
and they said,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.720
"Even though you've had
this great education,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.920
if you decide to get married
and have kids right away,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.240
that's OK by us, too."

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.336
They wanted me to do the thing
that would make me the very happiest.
