Their rate is about 12 percent.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.680
But why is it so low?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.880
One reason is that the most popular
contraceptives are rarely available.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.456
Women in Africa will tell you

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.576

is an injectable.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.616
They get it in their arm --
and they go about four times a year,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.696
they have to get it every three months --
to get their injection.
