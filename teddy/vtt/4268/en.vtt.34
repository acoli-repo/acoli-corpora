00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.536
there's a district called Matlab.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.296
It's where researchers have collected data
on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.856
In the global health community,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.576
we like to say it's one of the longest
pieces of research that's been running.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.776
We have so many great health statistics.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.336
In one of the studies, what did they do?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.455
Half the villagers
were chosen to get contraceptives.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.656
They got education
and access to contraception.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.856
Twenty years later,
following those villages,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.896
what we learned is that they had a better
quality of life than their neighbors.
