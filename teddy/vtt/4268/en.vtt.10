00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.000
So if we're going to make
progress on this issue,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.160
we have to be really clear
about what our agenda is.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.216
We're not talking about abortion.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.080
We're not talking
about population control.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.136
What I'm talking about is giving women
the power to save their lives,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.256
to save their children's lives

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.560
and to give their families
the best possible future.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.936
Now, as a world,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.216
there are lots of things we have to do
in the global health community

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.669
if we want to make the world
better in the future --
