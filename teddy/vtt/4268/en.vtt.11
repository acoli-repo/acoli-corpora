00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.669
if we want to make the world
better in the future --

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.136
things like fight diseases.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.696
So many children today die of diarrhea,
as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.336
They kill literally
millions of children a year.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.456
We also need to help small farmers --

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.400
farmers who plow
small plots of land in Africa --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.896
so that they can grow enough food
to feed their children.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.240
And we have to make sure that
children are educated around the world.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.336
But one of the simplest
and most transformative things we can do
