Maybe some of you know that feeling.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.320
And so we waited a little while
before we had our second child.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.696
And it's no accident
that we have three children

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.960
that are spaced three years apart.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.480

the very most for my children?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.720
I want them to feel the way I did --

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.200

they want to do in life.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.656

as I've travelled the last decade
for the foundation around the world
