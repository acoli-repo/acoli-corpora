00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400
they're uncomfortable with the topic
because it's about sex.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.056
Some people worry

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.440

is to control populations.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.536

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
should be able to decide
when they want to have a child.
