00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.816
And as a result, birth control has
almost completely and totally disappeared

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.440
from the global health agenda.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.496
The victims of this paralysis
are the people of sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.720
and South Asia.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.416
Here in Germany, the proportion of people
that use contraception

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.176
is about 66 percent.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320
That's about what you'd expect.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.360
In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.
