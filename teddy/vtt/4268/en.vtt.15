And one of the teachings that we girls
and my peers questioned

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.040
was is birth control really a sin?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.136
Because I think one of the reasons

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.496
we have this huge discomfort
talking about contraception

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.496
is this lingering concern

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.840
that if we separate sex from reproduction,
we're going to promote promiscuity.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.816
And I think that's a reasonable question
to be asked about contraception --

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.640
what is its impact on sexual morality?
