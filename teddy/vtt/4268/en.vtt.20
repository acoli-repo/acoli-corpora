00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680
as I've travelled the last decade
for the foundation around the world

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.240
is that all women want that same thing.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.456
Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums,
in one called Korogocho --

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.040
which literally means when translated,
"standing shoulder to shoulder."

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.896
And I spoke with this women's group
that's pictured here.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.056
And the women talked very openly
about their family life in the slums,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.496
what it was like.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.120
And they talked quite intimately
about what they did for birth control.
