00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.136
For 250 years, parents around the world

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.920
have been deciding
to have smaller families.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.136
This trend has been steady
for a quarter of a millennium,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.000
across cultures and across geographies,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.280
with the glaring exception
of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.376
The French started bringing down
their family size in the mid-1700s.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.320
And over the next 150 years,
this trend spread all across Europe.
