00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:31.944
I heard you were doing
a "Ra.One" sequel audition.

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:33.714
That's why I'm here.

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.384
(Laughter)

00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:40.424
SRK: Before I start talking with
this wonderful innovator

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:41.424
and one of the greatest people
from our country,

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:43.834
I'd like to thank you,

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.584
personally, on behalf of all of us
who'd come to your office. And please --

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:51.374
Is everyone OK there, all the boys and 
girls who were so warm and nice to us?

00:01:51.374 --> 00:01:55.154
SP: Everyone is okay. They are still 
screaming for you, but I have never seen

00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:57.864
anything like that, when you came here.
They are all OK.

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:00.464
SRK: Like people are screaming 
in your office for me,
