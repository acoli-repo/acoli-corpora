Shah Rukh Khan: Some time ago,
when I was invited to the headquarters

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.030
of the world's biggest internet-based
company, Google,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.240
I was really proud to know that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.470
a lot of people working there 
are of Indian origin.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.910
And now, I'm also proud, 
very, very proud that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.460
the company that is going to 
lead the world

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.970
is lead by an Indian engineer, 
Sundar Pichai.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.860
(Cheers and applause)
