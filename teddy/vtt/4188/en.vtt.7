One is Bollywood.

00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:32.384
(Laughter)

00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:35.504
In fact, when I did my 
interview with Shah Rukh,

00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:39.504
more people knew me after that 
than anything I had ever done.

00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:43.504
(Cheers and applause)

00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:46.094
The second, I have to say is traffic.

00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:50.094
We have this YouTube video which shows
the traffic in India, and people who have

00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:54.094
never been to India see that and ask me,
"Hey, how are your self-driven cars

00:03:54.094 --> 00:03:57.074
ever going to move around in India?


00:03:57.074 --> 00:04:00.004
And I tell them: that's a 
really hard problem.
