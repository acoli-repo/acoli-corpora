How does the world sees our country,
in terms of people, resources,

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:02.504
technology, future, everything?

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:06.084
SP: People have always had 
this promise of India.

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:09.614
But I think now India is 
living up to its promise,

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:13.614
and it's really exciting time. 
The fact it's a vibrant democracy,

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:17.614
the fact that people value education.


00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.534
Indians are very, very entrepreneurial.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:24.094
All of that really gives hope for India


00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:26.374
and it's really, really respected.

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:29.164
I would say two things though,
outside of all of this.

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:30.714
One is Bollywood.
