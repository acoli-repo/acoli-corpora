SP: One of the things which I'm 
really excited by is

00:04:33.264 --> 00:04:37.404
giving everyone in India, one day, 
a chance to carry a smartphone

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:40.014
with full connectivity.

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:43.854
And I think doing that can make a really
big difference in people's life,

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:47.464
and -- so we're working very 
hard to make smartphones cheaper

00:04:47.464 --> 00:04:48.934
and more affordable.

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.124
We want to get it to rural India 
as much as possible.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:54.664
So we have this program called 
"Internet Saathi,"

00:04:54.664 --> 00:05:00.064
where we work with TATA Trust, and we
train women in rural Indian villages.
