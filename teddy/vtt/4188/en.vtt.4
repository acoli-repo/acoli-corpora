SRK: Like people are screaming 
in your office for me,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.614
they are screaming here for you.

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:05.604
(Cheers and applause)

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:09.144
SRK: Could you tell us more about
this technology via which we're able

00:02:09.144 --> 00:02:12.404
to see you so clearly
and without any delay?

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.904
SP: This is great, it's called Beam.

00:02:15.904 --> 00:02:19.904
It allows me to use the robot 
move around and see all of you.

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:24.614
As you can see, technology keep,s getting 
better and hopefully, over time, we can

00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:28.614
we can make it easy so that it doesn't 
matter where you physically are

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.664
and you can really be there
any place you want to.
