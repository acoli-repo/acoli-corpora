00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.952
The lightbulb comes from this idea
that you have an energy system

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:37.800
that's made up of the ideas of Tesla

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:40.266
and the ideas of Thomas Edison.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.436
There was an evolution that said
it's not just about the lightbulb,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.795
it's about the whole system,

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.353
the whole energy system
that goes with that lightbulb,

00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:50.781
and what happened in that gilded age

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:53.051
was the creation of an industrial system

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.028
that every country around the world
has now started to emulate.

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:59.131
So to get to the appliances,
you need to have power stations.

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:01.639
From power stations,
you need to have infrastructure,
