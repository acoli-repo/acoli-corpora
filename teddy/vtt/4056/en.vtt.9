00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:32.030
So this is an incredible change
in the economy that's happening,

00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:35.348
and it's really opened up
something very, very innovative.

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:38.583
So I'm going to introduce you
to a lady I met with last week.

00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:39.758
Her name's Susan.

00:04:39.782 --> 00:04:41.275
It may not look like it,

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:45.718
but Susan is a representative
of a $27 billion market.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:50.559
27 billion dollars is what people
like Susan spend every year

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:53.622
on cell phone charging,

00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:58.286
flashlight batteries and kerosene
to light their homes.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.522
So Susan is a proud owner
of a small solar system.
