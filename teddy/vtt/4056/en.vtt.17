00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:32.123
it takes us out to two really big goals.

00:08:32.147 --> 00:08:35.664
We aspire towards
energy access for everybody,

00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:42.011
and we aspire towards
a fully-functioning low-carbon economy.

00:08:42.035 --> 00:08:44.336
And we're getting to the point
where we're seeing

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.266
the fully-functioning low-carbon economy

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.276
is not just about
getting people onto the grid,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.180
it's about getting people onto electricity

00:08:54.204 --> 00:08:56.942
and doing it in a way
that's really dignified.
