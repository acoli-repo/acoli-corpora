00:05:56.913 --> 00:06:02.754
I'd like to entertain,
educate me and my kids.

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:05.690
And then I would like to have
some hair clippers for my kids,

00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:08.652
you know, to cut my kids' hair,
and I'd love to have a fridge.

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.645
And she's coined something

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.082
that the energy world
is really hungry to do.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:17.714
The idea that she's coined
is the energy ladder.

00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:20.047
It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right?

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:25.477
And the lightbulb is an idea
that we can get our kids to do homework,

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.056
and very cheap, about five dollars,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.906
and we can get it distributed.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.613
But then let's go up from there.
