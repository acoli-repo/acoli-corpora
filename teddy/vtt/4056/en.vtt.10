00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.522
So Susan is a proud owner
of a small solar system.

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:04.889
It's a kit rather than a planetary thing,

00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:06.470
so a small solar system,

00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:10.382
and her small solar system
allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs,

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:14.629
and she's made this transition,
this jump, from kerosene into light.

00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:16.559
She has four or five lights and a radio.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.483
It's fantastic, and she talks about it.

00:05:18.507 --> 00:05:22.225
She talks about her kids doing homework
at night because she has light.

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.249
I'm not sure what
the kids feel about that.

00:05:24.273 --> 00:05:29.808
She talks about the fact that she can
go out at 4am and look after the cows,

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:31.083
and she's not so worried,
