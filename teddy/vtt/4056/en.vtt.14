00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.733
Is this headed here,

00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:04.430
where we can have distributed systems

00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:06.783
with the right infrastructure
to provide power

00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:08.656
for our hospitals and our schools?

00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:11.531
And really how far can this go?

00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:15.293
And this is the mindset shift
that I think is really exciting.

00:07:15.317 --> 00:07:16.467
How far can we go?

00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:19.132
Could it get up to here?

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:23.703
You know, this is the conceptual design
for one of the world's biggest factories,

00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:26.869
designed to be fully solar-powered
and fully off grid.

00:07:28.032 --> 00:07:29.223
Maybe we can get that.
