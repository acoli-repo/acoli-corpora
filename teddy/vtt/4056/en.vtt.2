From power stations,
you need to have infrastructure,

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:04.946
and that infrastructure takes you
to the point of having electricity,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.209
and you get to the lightbulbs
and the appliances

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.973
that we all take for granted.

00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:12.979
But the amazing thing, in a way,
is that there's a revolution happening

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.052
in the villages and towns
all around us here in East Africa.

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:21.449
And the revolution is an echo
of the cell phone revolution.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.022
It's wireless,

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:27.610
and that revolution is about solar
and it's about distributed solar.

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:28.912
Photons are wireless,

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:30.972
they fall on every rooftop,
