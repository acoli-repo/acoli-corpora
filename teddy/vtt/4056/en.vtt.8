00:03:55.293 --> 00:04:00.881
and their efficiency, when you
compare them to an incandescent bulb,

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:04.170
like the lightbulb I showed
in the previous slide,

00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:05.360
is incredible.

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:08.572
They give you 10 times
the amount of light,

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:10.431
and they last 30 times as long.

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:14.192
And then the last thing that's happened
is of course the cell phone revolution,

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:16.669
so we're piggybacking
off the cell phone revolution,

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:20.248
and we can now make decentralized
customers make small payments

00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:23.328
for bits of equipment and appliances

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:26.024
where actually they're now affordable.

00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.968
We can pay them off
over a daily or a weekly schedule.

00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:32.030
So this is an incredible change
in the economy that's happening,
