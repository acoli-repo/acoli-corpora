00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:02.937
There's something
really incredible happening.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.595
So there's over a billion people

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:08.809
who have no access to energy
whatsoever across the world,

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.710
620 million of them here in Africa.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:15.999
It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect
each household up to the grid.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:19.997
If you are going to wait for it,
it takes about nine years, on average,

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.307
and that feels like a lifetime
when you're trying to make that happen.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.736
That's kind of unbelievable,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.061
and it's also unacceptable.

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:29.236
So let's do something about it.
