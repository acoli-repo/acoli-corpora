up there in the sky,

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:06.114
and that Africa is more endowed
with that solar power

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:08.741
that comes from the sky, the sun,

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.633
than almost any other continent.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:15.448
So the opportunity has come
to convert some of that solar power,

00:03:15.472 --> 00:03:19.620
wireless power, into energy
at the household level.

00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:22.129
And three things have happened
at the same time.

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:25.398
First, the costs of solar
productivity have come down.

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:28.338
So putting a panel on your roof
and generating power from it,

00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:31.417
that cost has absolutely collapsed
over the last 30 years,
