00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.359
I mean, there's plenty of demand there.

00:13:31.383 --> 00:13:34.302
What's holding them back
from supplying that demand?

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.850
I mean, some of them talk about,

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:38.625
they would like to sell 10x
what they can currently sell.

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:41.367
AI: Exactly. So for many
of these capitals,

00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.660
it's that markets don't price
consumer risk very well,

00:13:44.684 --> 00:13:46.916
and particularly in markets like ours,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.046
in emerging markets and here in Africa.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.510
So there's not enough working capital
coming into this space

00:13:53.534 --> 00:13:56.135
because the big financiers
look at this space and say,

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:59.643
"I don't know how to price that risk,
so I'm going to stay away from it."

00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:02.028
And that's holding
a lot of these companies back.
