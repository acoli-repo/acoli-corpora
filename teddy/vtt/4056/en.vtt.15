So there's a generation of these companies

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:40.637
that are out there doing this work
and creating thousands of jobs,

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:44.515
creating, selling, tens of thousands
of these solar systems,

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:47.462
so bringing tens of thousands
of families into light,

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:51.246
and tackling that big $1 billion problem
that I talked about at the beginning,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.651
and really innovating.

00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:57.635
And what they're doing is,
they're not only energy companies,

00:07:57.659 --> 00:07:59.588
they're also credit finance companies,

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.682
so they're bringing
people into an economy.
