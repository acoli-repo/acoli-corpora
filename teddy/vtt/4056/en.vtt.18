00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:04.370
So I want us all
to picture it for a moment,

00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:06.700
really picture what this could mean:

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:08.959
[New energy ecosystem]

00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:11.948
an energy system that's not
just about subsistence power,

00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:14.649
getting the family off the kerosene,

00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:21.180
but it's actually the full suite
of appliances and tools

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:24.514
and productivity
that we've all gotten used to,

00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:28.267
so actually energy at a scale
that can drive industrial development.

00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:35.386
And it's the ability to have
powerful tools.
