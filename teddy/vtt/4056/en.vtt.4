00:01:57.243 --> 00:02:00.601
So we've gotten ourselves to the point

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.659
where actually the costs
of building these grids

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:05.641
and following that pattern of development

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.204
are really unsustainable.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:13.959
If you add up the deficits
that all of the utilities run in Africa,

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:16.359
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:20.336
you get to a number
of 21 billion dollars every year

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.192
to maintain that system and keep it going.

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:25.899
So an extraordinary amount of resources

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:28.201
that's been put in to creating a system

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:32.432
that ultimately we will have
to wait a very long time for,
