00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:30.973
Like, what could make this go faster?

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.500
AI: So the first one, I think, is really
the intermittency of solar power.

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:39.254
So the problem is that the sun
only shines for 12 hours a day,

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:42.014
so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day,

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:44.174
and we need to have storage solutions

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:46.575
that are better to help us
take us down that path.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.249
So storage is really one.

00:12:48.273 --> 00:12:50.079
CA: And those prices are coming down.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.453
AI: And those prices
are coming down very quickly.

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:54.250
Second, the appliance set.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.981
So it needs to get more efficient,

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.941
and it needs to get more diverse.

00:12:57.965 --> 00:12:59.520
We need to do more of the things

00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:01.778
we in Africa want to do
with the appliance set.
