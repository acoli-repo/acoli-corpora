00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.613
But then let's go up from there.

00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:33.879
This is the kit that Susan has:

00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:37.505
four lightbulbs, radio,
maybe a little flashlight,

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.554
a little solar panel on the roof.

00:06:39.578 --> 00:06:40.998
And then let's go up again.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.994
We can get maybe at about 500 dollars,

00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:49.010
the previous kit was maybe $150,

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.986
again, paid for over time,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.495
two years to pay it all off,

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:53.844
you can get the TV,

00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:56.241
so the lightbulbs and the TV.

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:59.374
And you start to ask yourself,
"So where is this headed?"

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.733
Is this headed here,
