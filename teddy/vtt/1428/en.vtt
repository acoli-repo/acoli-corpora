00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As technology progresses,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and as it advances,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
many of us assume that these advances

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
make us more intelligent,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
make us smarter and more connected to the world.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And what I'd like to argue

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is that that's not necessarily the case,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as progress is simply a word for change,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and with change you gain something,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but you also lose something.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is to show you how technology has dealt with

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
