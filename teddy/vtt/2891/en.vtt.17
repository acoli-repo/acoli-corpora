00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:30.818
But here's something else unfortunate:

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:33.513
clouds are really hard to see.

00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:36.480
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest

00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:38.703
is like, "I have some
suggestions for you."

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.751
(Laughter)

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:42.371
And you guys, we have tried looking up.

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:43.446
(Laughter)

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.489
But in order to do climate science,

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:51.646
we need to see all of the clouds,
everywhere, for a very long time.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.415
And that's what makes it hard.

00:08:54.097 --> 00:08:58.871
Now, nothing sees more clouds
than a satellite --

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:00.815
not even a British person.
