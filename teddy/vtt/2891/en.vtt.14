00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:02.448
which, for the record,
I am not advocating,

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.302
our planet would get warmer.

00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:08.786
So clearly, all of the clouds
are not going away.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.082
But climate change is change.

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:12.938
So we can ask:

00:07:12.962 --> 00:07:16.050
How will global warming change clouds?

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:19.690
But remember, clouds are so important

00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:21.812
in regulating the earth's temperature,

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:24.547
and they both warm and cool the planet.

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.651
So even small changes to cloud cover

00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:29.756
could have profound consequences.
