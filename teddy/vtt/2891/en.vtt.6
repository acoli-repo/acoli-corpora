00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.539
But some of them project catastrophe --

00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:03.414
more than five times the warming
we've seen already.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:06.341
And others are literally more chill.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.843
So why don't climate models agree
on how warm it's going to get?

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.481
Well, to a large extent,

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:18.085
it's because they don't agree
on what clouds will do in the future.

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:21.523
And that is because, just like me,

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:23.383
computers hate clouds.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.009
Computers hate clouds because
they're simultaneously very large

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.279
and very small.

00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:30.962
Clouds are formed
