that project relatively muted warming.

00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.757
But climate models struggle with clouds,

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:07.935
and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.

00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:10.921
Clouds could help us out
with global warming.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:13.432
They could also make it worse.

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:17.019
Now, we know that
climate change is happening

00:08:17.043 --> 00:08:18.808
because we can see it:

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:24.404
rising temperatures, melting icecaps,
shifts in rainfall patterns.

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.278
And you might think that we
could also see it in the clouds.

00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:30.818
But here's something else unfortunate:
