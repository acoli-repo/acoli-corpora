00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:00.098
it's giving off heat.

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.975
We are radiating thermal energy
away into space,

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.844
and we can see this in the infrared.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.979
Once again, clouds are blocking the view.

00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:14.190
That's because high clouds live
in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:15.587
where it's very cold.

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:19.689
And this means that they lose
very little heat to space themselves.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:24.104
But at the same time, they block
the heat coming up from the planet below.

00:06:24.128 --> 00:06:27.003
The earth is trying to cool itself off,

00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:29.536
and high clouds are getting in the way.
