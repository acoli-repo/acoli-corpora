00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.200
So we might also ask:

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:35.333
How will clouds change global warming?

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.027
And that is where there might
be space for hope.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:42.889
If global warming triggers cloud changes

00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:48.065
that make for a less powerful greenhouse
or a more effective sunshade,

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.779
then that would enhance
the cooling power of clouds.

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:55.330
It would act in opposition
to global warming,

00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:58.324
and that's what's happening
in those climate models

00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.841
that project relatively muted warming.
