00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.513
but we can't see all of it.

00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:33.758
Clouds are blocking the view.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.665
That's what they do.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.375
These low, thick clouds
are extremely effective sunshades.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.963
They turn back about 20 percent
of everything the sun sends us.

00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:47.178
That is a lot of wasted solar power.

00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:50.184
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.048
making the planet cooler.

00:05:52.072 --> 00:05:54.241
But that's not the only effect of clouds.

00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:56.518
Our planet has a temperature,

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:58.729
and like anything with a temperature,

00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:00.098
it's giving off heat.
