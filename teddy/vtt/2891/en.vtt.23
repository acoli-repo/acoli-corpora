00:11:29.476 --> 00:11:31.131
what the future holds.

00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:34.377
But we are sending our kids there,

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:36.980
and they are never coming back.

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:41.564
I want them to be prepared
for what they'll face,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.543
and that is why it is so important

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:48.818
to keep our earth-observing
satellites up there

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.638
and to hire diverse and smart
and talented people

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:54.929
who do not hate clouds

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:56.888
to improve the climate models.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.093
But uncertainty is not ignorance.
