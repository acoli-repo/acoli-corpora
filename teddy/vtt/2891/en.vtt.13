00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:34.237
The result is a very
powerful greenhouse effect.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.853
So, clouds play this very
large and dual role

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:40.448
in the climate system.

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.263
We've got low clouds that act
like a sunshade,

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:44.656
cooling the planet,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.599
and high clouds which act
like a greenhouse,

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:48.809
warming the planet.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:52.666
Right now, these two effects --
they don't cancel out.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.108
That sunshade -- it's a little
bit more powerful.

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:59.210
So if we got rid
of all the clouds tomorrow,

00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:02.448
which, for the record,
I am not advocating,
