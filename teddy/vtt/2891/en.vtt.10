00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:01.811
and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.056
largely let that sunlight stream through.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.013
Every sunny day is the same,

00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:09.520
but every cloudy day
is cloudy in its own way.

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:11.995
And it's this diversity

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:15.824
that can make the global impact of clouds
very hard to understand.

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.280
So to see this global effect of clouds,

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:21.947
it really helps to take a selfie.

00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:26.639
It will never cease to blow my mind

00:05:26.663 --> 00:05:29.211
that we can see our planet
from outer space,

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.513
but we can't see all of it.
