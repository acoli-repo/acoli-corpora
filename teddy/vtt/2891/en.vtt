I am a climate scientist,

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:05.977
and I hate weather.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.407
I have spent too much time in California,

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.096
and I strongly feel that weather
should be optional.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.254
(Laughter)

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:16.319
So I don't want to experience clouds,

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:17.716
let alone study them.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.063
But clouds seem to follow me
wherever I go.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.303
The thing is, clouds are a real
challenge for climate science.

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:31.792
We don't know how they're going to react
as the planet heats up,
