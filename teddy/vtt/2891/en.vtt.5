00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:32.434
So, models are not crystal balls.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.149
They're research tools,

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:38.423
and the ways in which they're wrong
can actually teach us a lot.

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.346
For example:

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.364
different climate models
are largely able to capture

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:45.512
the warming that we've seen so far.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.304
But fast-forward to the end of the century

00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:50.657
under a business-as-usual scenario,

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.207
and climate models
don't really agree anymore.

00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:56.979
Yeah, they're all warming;
that's just basic physics.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.539
But some of them project catastrophe --
