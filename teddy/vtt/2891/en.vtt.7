00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:30.962
Clouds are formed

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:35.611
when microscopic water droplets
or ice crystals coalesce

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.221
around tiny particles.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:41.414
But at the same time, they cover
two-thirds of the earth's surface.

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.915
In order to really
accurately model clouds,

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.463
we'd need to track the behavior
of every water droplet and dust grain

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:50.929
in the entire atmosphere,

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:53.454
and there's no computer
powerful enough to do that.

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:56.617
So instead, we have to make a trade-off:

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.023
we can zoom in and get the details right,
