00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.023
we can zoom in and get the details right,

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:03.025
but have no idea
what's going on worldwide;

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.972
or, we could sacrifice
realism at small scales

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:09.918
in order to see the bigger picture.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.539
Now, there's no one right answer,

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:14.118
no perfect way to do this,

00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:17.544
and different climate models
make different choices.

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:20.808
Now, it is unfortunate

00:04:20.832 --> 00:04:23.170
that computers struggle with clouds,

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:25.892
because clouds are crucially important

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.268
in regulating the temperature
of the planet.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:31.205
In fact, if all the clouds went away,
