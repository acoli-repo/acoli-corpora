Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.640
we're emitting a lot of it,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.210
and the planet is heating up.

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:06.846
Case closed.

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.362
But I still go to work every day.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.670
It turns out that there is a lot
that we don't understand

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.161
about climate change.

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.078
In particular, we haven't answered

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.986
what seems to be a very
fundamental question.

00:01:21.584 --> 00:01:23.175
We know it's going to get hot,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.918
but we don't know exactly
how hot it's going to get.

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.611
Now, this is a really
easy question to answer
