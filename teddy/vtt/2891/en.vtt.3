00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.611
Now, this is a really
easy question to answer

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.609
if one of you would like
to give me a time machine.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.094
But I'm going to be honest with you:

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:38.173
if I had a time machine,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.483
I would not be hanging out
at this particular point in history.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.282
So in order to see the future,

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.920
we have to rely on the output
of computer simulations --

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:50.907
climate models, like this one.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:53.358
Now, in my line of work,

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:57.083
I encounter many very charming
people on the internet

00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:01.243
who like to tell me
that climate models are all wrong.
