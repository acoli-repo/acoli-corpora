We don't know how they're going to react
as the planet heats up,

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:35.537
and hidden in that uncertainty

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.847
might be hope.

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.064
Maybe, just maybe,

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.769
clouds could slow down global warming,

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:46.440
and buy us a little bit more time
to get our act together,

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.180
which would be very convenient right now.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.277
Now, we are sure about some things.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:02.220
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,
