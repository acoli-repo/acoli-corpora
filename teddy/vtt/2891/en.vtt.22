00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.142
So if this keeps up,

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:04.263
this will also make global warming worse.

00:11:04.287 --> 00:11:06.608
And what we have not found,

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.910
despite years of looking,

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.512
is any indication of the opposite.

00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:14.977
There is no observational evidence

00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.736
that clouds will substantially
slow down global warming.

00:11:20.141 --> 00:11:23.478
The earth is not going
to break its own fever.

00:11:24.193 --> 00:11:26.629
Now, there are still uncertainties here.

00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:29.452
We don't know for sure

00:11:29.476 --> 00:11:31.131
what the future holds.
