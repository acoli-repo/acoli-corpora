00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:01.243
who like to tell me
that climate models are all wrong.

00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:04.258
And I would just like to say:

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:05.466
no kidding!

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.967
Seriously? I get paid to complain
about climate models.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:13.352
But we don't want models to be perfect.

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.320
We want them to be useful.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:17.577
I mean, think about it:

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.659
a computer simulation

00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:23.569
that's able to exactly
reproduce all of reality.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.955
That's not a climate model;

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.067
That's "The Matrix."

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:32.434
So, models are not crystal balls.
