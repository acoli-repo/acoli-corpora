00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.756
I've got to start by admitting
that in many ways

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.730
me giving a talk about how climate action
can help Black communities is surprising.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.806
I grew up poor and Black
with a single mother in Tottenham,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.816
one of the most deprived areas in London,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.104
in the 1970s and '80s.

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:20.922
Climate change was the last
thing on my mind.

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:25.812
And representing Tottenham as its member
of Parliament for the past 20 years,

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:30.246
my focus has been on trying to reduce
the deprivation I grew up around.
