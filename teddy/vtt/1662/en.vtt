00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.178
This is an image of the planet Earth.

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:06.271
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures

00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:07.882
that are very well known.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.952

you can click on it,

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.597
and if you click on it,

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.669

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:20.334
of the EPFL campus.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.442
In many cases, you can also see

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.182
how a building looks from a nearby street.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:27.604
This is pretty amazing.

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:31.031
But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:
