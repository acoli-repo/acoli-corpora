00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:03.664
I live in South Central.

00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:05.807
This is South Central:

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:08.677
liquor stores,

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:11.052
fast food,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.396
vacant lots.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.078
So the city planners, they get together and they figure

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:18.324
they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.492
so they change it to South Los Angeles,

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.374
like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.084
This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:31.252
Liquor stores,
