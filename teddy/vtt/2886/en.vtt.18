Design is a way in which
we can feel included in the world,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.336
but it is also a way in which
we can uphold a person's dignity

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.720
and their human rights.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.296
Design can also inflict vulnerability

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.800

How can we amplify their voices

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.440
and their experiences?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.400
What is the next step?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.976
Design is an enormous privilege,
