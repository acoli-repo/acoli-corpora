00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.320
I want shoes that affect my maturity,
professionalism and sophistication.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400
Instead, I'm offered sneakers
with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.976
Now, I'm not totally opposed
to light-up shoes.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.200
(Laughter)

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.496
But design also impacts
on such simple things,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.960
like sitting on a chair.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.440
I cannot go from a standing
to a seating position with grace.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.576
Due to the standards
of design heights of chairs,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.296
I have to crawl on my hands and knees

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.936
just to get on top of it,
