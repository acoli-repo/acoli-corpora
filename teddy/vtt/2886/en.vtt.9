00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.920
Now, think just for a second.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
Where do they put it?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.800
Up high and without a lid.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.376
Reaching up to collect a coffee
that I have paid for

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.840
is an incredibly dangerous experience.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.896
But design also impinges
on the clothes that I want to wear.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.560
I want garments
that reflect my personality.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.000
It's difficult to find
in the childrenswear department.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.920
And often womenswear
requires far too many alterations.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.320
I want shoes that affect my maturity,
professionalism and sophistication.
