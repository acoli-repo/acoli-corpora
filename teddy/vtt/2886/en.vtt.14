00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.840
But I am most proud to be Sinead.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.720
Achondroplasia is
the most common form of dwarfism.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.960
Achondroplasia translates
as "without cartilage formation."

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.496
I have short limbs
and achondroplastic facial features,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.840
my forehead and my nose.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.176
My arms do not straighten fully,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.080
but I can lick my elbow.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.021
I'm not showing you that one.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.680
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately
one in every 20,000 births.
