00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.640
but I'm trying
to wean myself off the syrup.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.536
But the coffee shop,
it's not designed well,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.760
at least not for me.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.296
Queuing, I'm standing
beside the pastry cabinet

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.360
and the barista calls for the next order.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.400
"Next, please!" they shout.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.640
They can't see me.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.456
The person next to me in the queue
points to my existence

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.720
and everyone is embarrassed.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.520
I order as quick as I can
and I move along to collect my coffee.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.920
Now, think just for a second.
