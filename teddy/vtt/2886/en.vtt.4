00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.240
Not really.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.960
Is it hygienic and sanitary?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640
Definitely not.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.380
But the alternative is much worse.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
If that doesn't work, I use my phone.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.216
It gives me an additional
four- to six-inch reach,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.920
and I try to jam the lock closed
with my iPhone.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.136
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive
had in mind when he designed the iPhone,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.360
but it works.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440
The alternative
is that I approach a stranger.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.736
I apologize profusely
