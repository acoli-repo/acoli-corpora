00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:03.040
I want to give you a new perspective.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840
That sounds grandiose, and it is.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280
I left Ireland yesterday morning.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.336
I traveled from Dublin to New York

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.560
independently.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.976
But the design of an airport,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.536
plane and terminal

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.480
offers little independence when
you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.440
For Americans, that's 3' 5".

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400
I was whisked through the airport
by airline assistants in a wheelchair.
