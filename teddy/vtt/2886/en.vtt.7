00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.880
what does that mean?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
Who is it accessible to?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.600
And whose needs
are not being accommodated for?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.496
Now, the bathroom is an example

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.040
of where design impinges upon my dignity,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.440
but the physical environment impacts
upon me in much more casual ways too,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480
something as simple
as ordering a cup of coffee.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.680
Now, I'll admit it.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.040
I drink far too much coffee.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.056
My order is a skinny vanilla latte,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.640
but I'm trying
to wean myself off the syrup.
