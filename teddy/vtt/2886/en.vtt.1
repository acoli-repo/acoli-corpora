00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400
I was whisked through the airport
by airline assistants in a wheelchair.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.776
but the design of an airport

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.056
and its lack of accessibility

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.160
means that it's my only way
to get through.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.016
With my carry-on bag between my feet,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.416
I was wheeled through
security, preclearance

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
and I arrived at my boarding gate.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.736
I use the accessibility
services in the airport

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
because most of the terminal
is just not designed with me in mind.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.640
Take security, for example.
