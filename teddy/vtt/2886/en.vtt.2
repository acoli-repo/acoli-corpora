00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.640
Take security, for example.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.416
I'm not strong enough
to lift my carry-on bag

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.480
from the ground to the carousel.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.080
I stand at eye level with it.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.496
And those who work in that space
for safety purposes cannot help me

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200
and cannot do it for me.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.960
Design inhibits my autonomy
and my independence.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480
But traveling at this size,
it isn't all bad.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.736
The leg room in economy
is like business class.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.640
