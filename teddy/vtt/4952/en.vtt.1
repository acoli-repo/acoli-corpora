00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.406
None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:35.183
– a man named Bayard Rustin.

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:37.035
Rustin grew up in a Quaker household,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.803
and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school.

00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:43.390
He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.809
and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.432
During his two-year imprisonment,

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:54.182
he protested the segregated 
facilities from within.

00:00:54.182 --> 00:00:55.713
Wherever Rustin went,

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.586
he organized and advocated, 


00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.943
and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people
