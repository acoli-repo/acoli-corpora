00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:01.009
when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.778
The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:07.715
and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.071
Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare,

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:15.841
but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals.

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:17.901
In spite of his deft management,

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.137
some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:24.962
with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality.

00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:26.321
Despite these slights,

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.268
Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.889
he delivered the
marchers' demands
