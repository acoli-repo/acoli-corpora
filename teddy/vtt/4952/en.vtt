00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.497
On August 28th, 1963,

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:13.050
Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.031
at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom.

00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:16.953
That day,


00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.343
nearly a quarter million people

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:19.912
gathered on the national mall

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:23.892
to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence,

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:26.740
and economic exclusion 
black people still faced

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.846
across the United States.

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.406
None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer
