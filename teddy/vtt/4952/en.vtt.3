00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:30.525
He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955,

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:32.536
and shared these ideas with him.

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:34.439
As King’s prominence increased,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.514
Rustin became his main advisor,

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:39.966
as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.821
He brought his organizing expertise 


00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.618
to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:46.366
—in fact,

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.579
he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.568
that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:57.526
His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963,

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:01.009
when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington.
