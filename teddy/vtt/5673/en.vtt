MarÃ­a Teresa Kumar: Much has been made
of the 2020 US election.

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:06.980
Right now, just over a week later,

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.068
pollsters are issuing mea culpas,

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.161
Democrats are tentatively celebrating,

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:14.228
Republicans are blowing
their collective tops,

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:16.103
lawyers are busier than ever,

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:18.236
ballot-counters are still hard at it,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.540
and demographers are desperately
trying to understand

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:24.420
who voted, for whom, where and why.

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:27.537
Much has been said
of the Latino vote in this election,

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.675
which is something
I know a little bit about,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.750
having been working obsessively over it
for the last 16 years.
