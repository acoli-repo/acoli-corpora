00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.200
And that's already
over 900 million options.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.496
If you considered each option
for a single second,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.856
that would take you
over 28 years to get through.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.400
900 million options.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.616
So we created a tool
that allowed decisionmakers

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.256
to weed through all 900 million options

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.640
in just a matter of days.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.800
It turned out to be incredibly successful.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.656
In an operation in Iraq,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.216
we saved 17 percent of the costs,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.376
and this meant that you had the ability
to feed an additional 80,000 people.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.800
It's all thanks to the use of data
and modeling complex systems.
