00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.096
across all of the major facets
of a humanitarian operation,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.720
we could feed, clothe and shelter
hundreds of thousands more people,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.696
and companies need to step up
and play the role that I know they can

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.600
in bringing about this revolution.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.656
You've probably heard of the saying
"food for thought."

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.920
Well, this is literally thought for food.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.696
It finally is the right idea
at the right time.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.936
(Laughter)

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.536
Très magnifique.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.776
Thank you.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.651
(Applause)
