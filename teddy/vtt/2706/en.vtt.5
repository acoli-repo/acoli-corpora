00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.682
Well, what should you do?
What's the best way to handle it?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.040
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.976
How much?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.136
It sounds simple. It's not.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.376
You have 30 possible foods,
and you have to pick five of them.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.816
That's already over 140,000
different combinations.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.536
Then for each food that you pick,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.536
you need to decide how much you'll buy,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.256
where you're going to get it from,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.760
where you're going to store it,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.736
how long it's going to take to get there.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.096
You need to look at all of the different
transportation routes as well.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.200
And that's already
over 900 million options.
