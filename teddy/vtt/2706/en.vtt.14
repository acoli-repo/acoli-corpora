00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.720
like in the operations in Iraq
and other countries.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.616
I don't think that's
an unrealistic timeline

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.376
when it comes to using data
to make operational changes.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.800
It's an investment. It requires patience.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.256
But the types of results
that can be produced are undeniable.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.840
In our case, it was the ability
to feed tens of thousands more people.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.776
So we have donating data,
we have donating decision scientists,
