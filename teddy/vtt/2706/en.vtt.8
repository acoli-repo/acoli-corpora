00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.296
And there's one group that's not being
leveraged in the way that it should be.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.416
Did you guess it? Companies.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.040
Companies have a major role to play
in fixing the big problems in our world.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.296
I've been in the private sector
for two years now.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.896
I've seen what companies can do,
and I've seen what companies aren't doing,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.296
and I think there's three main ways
that we can fill that gap:

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.416
by donating data,
by donating decision scientists

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.920
and by donating technology
to gather new sources of data.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.496
This is data philanthropy,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.360
and it's the future of corporate
social responsibility.
