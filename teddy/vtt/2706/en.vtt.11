00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.696
But even if the floodgates opened up,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.256
and even if all companies
donated their data

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.536
to academics, to NGOs,
to humanitarian organizations,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.536
it wouldn't be enough
to harness that full impact of data

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.080
for humanitarian goals.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.776
Why?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.040
To unlock insights in data,
you need decision scientists.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.336
Decision scientists are people like me.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.176
They take the data, they clean it up,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.456
transform it and put it
into a useful algorithm

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.320
that's the best choice
to address the business need at hand.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.496
In the world of humanitarian aid,
there are very few decision scientists.
