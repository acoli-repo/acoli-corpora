on the hot seat to step up
and play the role that I know they can.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.336
My experiences back in Rome prove

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.440
using data you can save lives.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.896
OK, not that first attempt,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.496
but eventually we got there.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.256
Let me paint the picture for you.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.016
Imagine that you have to plan
breakfast, lunch and dinner

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.656
for 500,000 people,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.816
and you only have
a certain budget to do it,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080
say 6.5 million dollars per month.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.682
Well, what should you do?
What's the best way to handle it?
