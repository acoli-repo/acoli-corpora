00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.256
That's all going to change
in the next few weeks,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.160
thanks to private sector collaboration.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.496
There's going to be a new system based
on donated package tracking technology

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.560
from the logistics company
that I work for.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.456
With this new system,
there will be a data trail,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.936
so you know exactly the moment

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.456
when that mother and her children
walk into the camp.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.096
And even more, you know
if she's going to have supplies

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.376
this month and the next.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.416
Information visibility drives efficiency.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.696
For companies, using technology
to gather important data,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.176
it's like bread and butter.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.776
They've been doing it for years,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.056
and it's led to major
operational efficiency improvements.
