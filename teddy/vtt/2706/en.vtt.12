00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.496
In the world of humanitarian aid,
there are very few decision scientists.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.160
Most of them work for companies.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.976
So that's the second thing
that companies need to do.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.696
In addition to donating their data,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.880
they need to donate
their decision scientists.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.256
Now, companies will say, "Ah! Don't take
our decision scientists from us.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.320
We need every spare second of their time."

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.560
But there's a way.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.616
If a company was going to donate
a block of a decision scientist's time,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.776
it would actually make more sense
to spread out that block of time

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000
over a long period,
say for example five years.
