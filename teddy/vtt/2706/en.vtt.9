00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.360
and it's the future of corporate
social responsibility.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.760
Bonus, it also makes good business sense.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.136
Companies today,
they collect mountains of data,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.922
so the first thing they can do
is start donating that data.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.136
Some companies are already doing it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.576
Take, for example,
a major telecom company.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.376
They opened up their data
in Senegal and the Ivory Coast

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.376
and researchers discovered

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.734
that if you look at the patterns
in the pings to the cell phone towers,

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:55.696
you can see where people are traveling.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.896
And that can tell you things like

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.016
where malaria might spread,
and you can make predictions with it.
