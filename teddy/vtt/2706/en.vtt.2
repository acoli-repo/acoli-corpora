00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.136
and bottom line,
we're going to save lives.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.376
You're welcome.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.096
(Laughter)

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.096
I thought it was going to take 12 months,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.680
OK, maybe even 13.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.080
This is not quite how it panned out.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.376
Just a couple of months into the project,
my French boss, he told me,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.216
"You know, Mallory,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.896
it's a good idea,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.256
but the data you need
for your algorithms is not there.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.816
It's the right idea but at the wrong time,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.136
and the right idea at the wrong time

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.536
is the wrong idea."

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.880
(Laughter)
