00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.800
It's all thanks to the use of data
and modeling complex systems.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.080
But we didn't do it alone.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.576
The unit that I worked with in Rome,
they were unique.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.336
They believed in collaboration.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.056
They brought in the academic world.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.360
They brought in companies.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.816
And if we really want to make big changes
in big problems like world hunger,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.400
we need everybody to the table.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.976
We need the data people
from humanitarian organizations

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.256
leading the way,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.856
and orchestrating
just the right types of engagements

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.576
with academics, with governments.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.296
And there's one group that's not being
leveraged in the way that it should be.
