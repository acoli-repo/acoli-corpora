00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.416
and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.400
and I smiled as I thought to myself,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.456
"The engineer is here."

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.696
(Laughter)

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.496
Give me your data.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.696
I'm going to optimize everything.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.456
(Laughter)

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.376
Tell me the food that you've purchased,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.016
tell me where it's going
and when it needs to be there,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.776
and I'm going to tell you
the shortest, fastest, cheapest,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.736
best set of routes to take for the food.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.256
We're going to save money,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.376
we're going to avoid
delays and disruptions,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.136
and bottom line,
we're going to save lives.
