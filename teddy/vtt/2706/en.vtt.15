00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.776
So we have donating data,
we have donating decision scientists,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.496
and there's actually a third way
that companies can help:

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.496
donating technology
to capture new sources of data.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.360
You see, there's a lot of things
we just don't have data on.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.680
Right now, Syrian refugees
are flooding into Greece,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.680
and the UN refugee agency,
they have their hands full.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.056
The current system for tracking people
is paper and pencil,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.336
and what that means is

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.216
that when a mother and her five children
walk into the camp,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.896
headquarters is essentially
blind to this moment.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.256
That's all going to change
in the next few weeks,
