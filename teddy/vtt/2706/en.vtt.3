00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240
Project over.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.320
I was crushed.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.456
When I look back now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.136
on that first summer in Rome

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.816
and I see how much has changed
over the past six years,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080
it is an absolute transformation.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.040
It's a coming of age for bringing data
into the humanitarian world.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.816
It's exciting. It's inspiring.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.040
But we're not there yet.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.616
And brace yourself, executives,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.616
because I'm going to be putting companies

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.760
on the hot seat to step up
and play the role that I know they can.
