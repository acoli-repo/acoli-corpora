00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:30.902
And it would be the size
of a small marble.

00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.677
And there's more, if I haven't
blown your mind by now.

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.321
Let's consider the atom some more.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.542
It contains protons,
neutrons and electrons.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.995
The protons and neutrons
live inside of the nucleus,

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.210
and contain almost
all of the mass of the atom.

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:44.976
Way on the edge are the electrons.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.976
So if an atom is like a ball
the size of a football stadium,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.905
with the nucleus in the center,
and the electrons on the edge,

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.215
what is in between the nucleus
and the electrons?

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:57.111
Surprisingly, the answer is empty space.
