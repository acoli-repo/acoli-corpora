You probably already know

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.723
everything is made up
of little tiny things called atoms

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.708
or even that each atom
is made up of even smaller particles

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:22.854
called protons, neutrons and electrons.

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:25.165
And you've probably heard
that atoms are small.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.349
But I bet you haven't ever thought
about how small atoms really are.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:33.089
Well, the answer is
that they are really, really small.
