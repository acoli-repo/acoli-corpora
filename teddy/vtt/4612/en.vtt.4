00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:00.720
OK. Let's blow up the atom --
the blueberry --

00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:01.976
to the size of a house.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.738
So imagine a ball that is as tall
as a two-story house.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:08.239
Let's look for the nucleus
in the center of the atom.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:11.558
And do you know what?
It would just barely be visible.

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.962
So to get our minds wrapped
around how big the nucleus is,

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:18.976
we need to blow up the blueberry,
up to the size of a football stadium.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
So imagine a ball the size
of a football stadium,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
and right smack dab
in the center of the atom,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.334
you would find the nucleus,
and you could see it!

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:30.902
And it would be the size
of a small marble.
