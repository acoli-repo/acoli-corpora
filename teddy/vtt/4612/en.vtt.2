00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.949
It would have to be the same size of
-- well, actually, the Earth.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:02.989
That's crazy!

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:05.834
You mean to say that if I filled
the Earth with blueberries,

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:08.835
I would have the same number
of nitrogen atoms as a grapefruit?

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:09.859
That's right!

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.791
So how big is the atom?

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:14.502
Well, it's really, really small!

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.976
And you know what?
It gets even more crazy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.773
Let's now look inside of each atom
-- and thus the blueberry, right? --

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:22.910
What do you see there?

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.655
In the center of the atom
is something called the nucleus,

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.406
which contains protons and neutrons,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.491
and on the outside, you'd see electrons.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.976
So how big is the nucleus?
