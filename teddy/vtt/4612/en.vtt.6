(Wind noise)

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.976
That's right. Empty!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.305
Between the nucleus and the electrons,
there are vast regions of empty space.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.901
Now, technically there are
some electromagnetic fields,

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:11.836
but in terms of stuff,
matter, it is empty.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.383
Remember this vast region of empty space
is inside the blueberry,

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:17.302
which is inside the Earth,

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.511
which really are the atoms
in the grapefruit.

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:22.976
OK, one more thing,
if I can even get more bizarre.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.355
Since virtually all the mass
of an atom is in the nucleus --

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.028
now, there is some amount
of mass in the electrons,
