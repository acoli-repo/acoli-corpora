00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.028
now, there is some amount
of mass in the electrons,

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.073
but most of it is in the nucleus --

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:33.869
how dense is the nucleus?

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:35.812
Well, the answer is crazy.

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.726
The density of a typical nucleus

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.976
is four times 10 to the 17th
kilograms per meter cubed.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.944
But that's hard to visualize.
OK, I'll put it in English units.

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.976
2.5 times 10 to the 16th pounds
per cubic feet.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:51.769
OK, that's still kind of hard to figure.

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:53.894
OK, here's what I want you to do.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.442
Make a box that is one foot
by one foot by one foot.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.153
Now let's go and grab
all of the nuclei from a typical car.
