00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.976
So how big is the nucleus?

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.516
If atoms are like blueberries
in the Earth,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.317
how big would the nucleus be?

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.558
You might remember the old pictures
of the atom from science class,

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:42.345
where you saw this tiny dot on the page
with an arrow pointing to the nucleus.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.764
Well, those pictures,
they're not drawn to scale,

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.403
so they're kind of wrong.

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:47.983
So how big is the nucleus?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.976
So if you popped open the blueberry
and were searching for the nucleus ...

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.482
You know what? It would be invisible.

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.148
It's too small to see!

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:00.720
OK. Let's blow up the atom --
the blueberry --
