00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.153
Now let's go and grab
all of the nuclei from a typical car.

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:03.511
Now, cars on average weigh two tons.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:07.071
How many cars' nuclei would you
have to put into the box

00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:10.048
to have your one-foot-box have
the same density of the nucleus?

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:11.400
Is it one car? Two?

00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:12.424
How about 100?

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.148
Nope, nope and nope.

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:17.064
The answer is much bigger.

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:20.497
It is 6.2 billion.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:24.196
That is almost equal to the number
of people in the Earth.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.554
So if everyone in the Earth
owned their own car --

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:27.909
and they don't --

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.148
(Cars honking)

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:31.372
and we put all of those
cars into your box ...
