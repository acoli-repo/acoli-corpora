00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:31.372
and we put all of those
cars into your box ...

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.634
That would be about
the density of a nucleus.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.453
So I'm saying that if you took
every car in the world

00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:41.808
and put it into your one-foot box,

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.976
you would have the density of one nucleus.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.212
OK, let's review.

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:46.896
The atom is really,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.218
really, really small.

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:52.608
Think atoms in a grapefruit
like blueberries in the Earth.

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:56.024
The nucleus is crazy small.

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:57.717
Now look inside the blueberry,

00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:00.156
and blow it up to the size
of a football stadium,
