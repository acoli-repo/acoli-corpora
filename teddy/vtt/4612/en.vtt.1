00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:33.089
Well, the answer is
that they are really, really small.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.947
So you ask, just how small are atoms?

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:40.044
To understand this,
let's ask this question:

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:41.976
How many atoms are in a grapefruit?

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.150
Well, let's assume that the grapefruit
is made up of only nitrogen atoms,

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:49.832
which isn't at all true, but there
are nitrogen atoms in a grapefruit.

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:52.887
To help you visualize this,
let's blow up each of the atoms

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.724
to the size of a blueberry.

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.896
And then how big
would the grapefruit have to be?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.949
It would have to be the same size of
-- well, actually, the Earth.
