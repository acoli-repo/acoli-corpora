daughters' school tuition

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:32.886
and uniforms.

00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:36.061

00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:38.363
we sell.

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:44.196
We sell it to suppliers of great brands

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.958
like Marks and Spencer,

00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:48.601
who have commissioned
the use of social plastic

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.015
in their products.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.148
Or like Henkel,

00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:56.020
the German consumer-goods company,

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:01.353
who are using social plastic
directly into their manufacturing.
