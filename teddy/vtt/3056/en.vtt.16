00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:07.053
allowing them to serve more people

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.417
and have their own greater social impact.

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:14.734
And what's common here

00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:19.022

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:31.580
alleviates poverty
and cleans the environment
