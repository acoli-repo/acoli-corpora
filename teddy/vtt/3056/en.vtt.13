00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:30.950
is completely replicable.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:33.529
In São Paulo,

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:36.410
a church sermon encourages parishioners

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:38.656
to not just bring offering on Sunday,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.102
but the recycling, too.

00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:43.616
We then match the church with the poor.

00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:46.029
Or, I believe more powerfully,

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:49.541
we could match a mosque in London
with an impoverished church in Cairo.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.192
Or like in Vancouver,

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.823
with our bottle-deposit program:

00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:56.595
now any individual

00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:58.632
or any group

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.534
can now return
