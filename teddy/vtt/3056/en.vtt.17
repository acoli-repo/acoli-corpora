It's not recycled plastic,
it's social plastic,

00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:44.116
a material whose value is transferred

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.824
through the lives
of the people who encounter it,

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:49.398
rich and poor.

00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:53.680
Humans have produced

00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:56.848
over eight trillion kilograms of plastic,

00:08:56.872 --> 00:08:59.304
most of it still here as waste.
