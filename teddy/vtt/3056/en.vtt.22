00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.268
That alone will put
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.025
into the hands of the poor

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:04.950
in the emerging economies.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:09.909
And so now,

00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:11.901
we can all

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:14.903
be a part of the solution

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.040
and not the pollution.

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.783
And so, OK, maybe
cleaning the ocean is futile.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:24.557
It might be.

00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:27.766
But preventing ocean plastic

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.160
could be humanity's richest opportunity.
