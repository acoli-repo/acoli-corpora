WEBVTT

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.534
can now return

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:02.933
their deposit-refundable recyclables,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.355
and instead of taking back the cash,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.410
they have the opportunity
to deposit that value

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:11.355
into the account of the poor
around the world.

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:14.642
We can now use our recycling

00:07:15.093 --> 00:07:17.355
to support and create recyclers.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.711
One bottle deposited at home

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.228
could help extract
hundreds around the world.

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:27.089
Or, like Shell,

00:07:27.518 --> 00:07:28.785
the energy company,

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:32.549
who's invested in our
plastic-neutral program.
