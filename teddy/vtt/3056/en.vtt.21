00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:30.191
And this year, we're committing
to India and Ethiopia.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.865
We're collecting hundreds

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:36.666
and hundreds of tons of material.

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.061
We continue to add partners

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:41.094
and customers,

00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:46.195
and we increase our collection
volumes every day.

00:10:47.007 --> 00:10:49.292
Now as a result
of our program with Henkel,

00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:54.332
they've committed to use
over 100 million kilograms

00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:56.915
of material every year.

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.268
That alone will put
hundreds of millions of dollars
