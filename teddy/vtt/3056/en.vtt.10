00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.767
Now, it's no different
than walking over acres of diamonds.

00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:07.776
If Lise was to walk over acres of diamonds

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.831
but there was no store, no bank,

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:12.820
no way to use the diamonds,
no way to exchange them,

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.283
they'd be worthless, too.

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:20.133
And Lise was widowed

00:05:20.157 --> 00:05:22.164
after the 2010 Haitian earthquake,

00:05:23.768 --> 00:05:25.315
left homeless without an income.

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.339
And as a result of the program,

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:30.680
Lise can afford her two
daughters' school tuition
