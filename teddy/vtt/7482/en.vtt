00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:01.506
We think of a great leader

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.446
as the unwavering captain
who guides us forward

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.336
through challenge and complexity.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.786
Confident, unwavering leaders,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.201
armed with data and past experience

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:14.908
have long been celebrated
in business and politics alike.

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.138
But sometimes and certainly now,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.289

that is so new and so urgent

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.607
that it upends everything
we thought we knew.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.518
One thing we know for sure

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.327
is that more upheavals are coming.
