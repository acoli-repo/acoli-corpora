00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.659
This is me in 1979,

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:34.428
a kid from California backpacking
his way through the Ituri Forest of Zaire.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.864
I was on a yearlong hitchhiking trip.

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:39.032
I had just dropped out
of Stanford University,

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:41.863
and I went from Tunis
to Kisangani to Cairo

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:44.283
and learned how to live
on 10 dollars a day.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.959
It was an amazing experience for me.

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:49.610
I spent about a week
in this Dinka cattle camp

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:51.618
on the banks of the Nile in South Sudan.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.063
The Dinka taught me
how to tie papyrus into a shelter,

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:59.516
and also I observed
how they had adapted their way of life

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.975
around the migratory needs
of their beloved cattle.
