00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.216
like a bird?

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.792
Well, that notion stayed with me,

00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:35.625
and 20 years later,

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.674
after becoming
a professional photographer,

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.610
I was able to talk National Geographic

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.801
into doing a big story
in the central Sahara,

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:44.261
and I came back with a new kind
of flying machine.

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:48.645
This is me piloting the world's lightest
and slowest aircraft.

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:49.700
(Laughter)

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:51.945
It's called a motorized paraglider.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.088
It consists of a backpack motor
and a parachute-style wing,

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:58.533
and it flies at about 30 miles an hour.

00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:01.970
With 10 liters of fuel,
I can fly for about two hours,
