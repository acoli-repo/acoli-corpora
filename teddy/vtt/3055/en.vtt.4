00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:01.970
With 10 liters of fuel,
I can fly for about two hours,

00:02:01.994 --> 00:02:05.745
but what's really amazing about it
is it gives me an unobstructed view,

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:07.510
both horizontally and vertically,

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:09.113
like a flying lawn chair.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.340
My hitchhiker's dream
of flying over Africa came true

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.296
when I spotted these two camel caravans
passing out in the middle of the Sahara.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.226
The one in the foreground
is carrying salt out of the desert,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.646
while the one in the background
is carrying fodder

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.256
for the animals heading back in.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.644
I realized you couldn't take
this kind of picture

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:27.113
with a conventional aircraft.

00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:28.582
An airplane moves too fast,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.225
a helicopter would be too loud
with too much downdraft,
