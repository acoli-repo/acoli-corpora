00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.975
around the migratory needs
of their beloved cattle.

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:05.714
It was a like a graduate course
in ecological ethnography,

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:07.784
and I got busy taking notes with a camera.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.134
With no money for rides,

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:13.119
they often made the Mzungu
ride on the roof of the trucks,

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:16.396
or in this case, on the top of the train
going across South Sudan.

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:20.630
I felt like I was riding
on the back of an insect

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:23.154
going across the enormous
tapestry of Africa.

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:25.211
It was an incredible view from up there,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:26.721
but I couldn't help but think,

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:29.920
wouldn't it be even more amazing
if I could fly over that landscape

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.216
like a bird?
