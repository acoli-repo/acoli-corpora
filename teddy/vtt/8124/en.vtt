What if our efforts
to build a better planet

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:07.795
benefited half of this room more?

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:11.799
What if we reduced our emissions

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.719
but increased the gap
between men and women?

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:18.890
What if by 2050 we reach net zero,

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:23.144
but women had a lower chance
than men to find a decent job?

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.521
Disturbing, right?

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:29.692
And yet, this is exactly
what my colleagues and I found

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.195
while studying the links
between women and climate
