00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:05.263
So, we used to solve big problems.

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:08.783
On July 21st, 1969,

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:12.370
Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.927
and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.657
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:20.943
but their presence on the moon's gray surface

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:26.074
was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:28.118
The Apollo program was the greatest

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.855
peacetime mobilization

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:31.793
in the history of the United States.
