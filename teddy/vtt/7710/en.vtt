00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, a big question that we're facing now

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and have been for quite a number of years now:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
are we at risk of a nuclear attack?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, there's a bigger question

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that's probably actually more important than that,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is the notion of permanently eliminating

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the possibility of a nuclear attack,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
eliminating the threat altogether.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I would like to make a case to you that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
until this very moment,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world
