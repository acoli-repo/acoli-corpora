As you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:04.194
about dance. I'm passionate about making it,

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:06.798
about watching it, about encouraging others

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.667

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:20.053

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.488

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:26.400
your own cognitive habits, and use that as

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.852
a point of departure to misbehave beautifully.

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:34.255
I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big
