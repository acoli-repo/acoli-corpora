00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
some sort of will to fight --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that iron will that we all have,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that this elephant has,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that conservation has, that big cats have.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Everything has that will to survive,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to fight, to push through that mental barrier

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and to keep going.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And for us, in many ways,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
this elephant has become

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
a symbol of inspiration for us,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
