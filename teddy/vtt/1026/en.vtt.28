no more so than the lions do, the male lions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is actually a red herring,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and they all are actually

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
infected with the same disease.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I call it complacency --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
our complacency.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that we're all aware of, that we condone.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And that's probably because we haven't seen it

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
like we are today.
