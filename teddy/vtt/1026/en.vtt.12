is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,

This sort of behavior has been going on

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Sleep deprivation is extreme.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We're on the edge
