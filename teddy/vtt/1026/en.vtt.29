BJ: And you have to know

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that, when a male lion is killed,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
it completely disrupts the whole pride.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A new male comes into the area

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and takes over the pride,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we've estimated

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
when one lion is hanging on a wall

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
somewhere in a far-off place.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
DJ: So what our investigations have shown

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
is that these lions are essential.
