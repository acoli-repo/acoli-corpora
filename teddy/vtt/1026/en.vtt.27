00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And of course, looking at this lion paw

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that has been skinned,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it eerily reminds me

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of a human hand,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
is going to wipe out all the tigers.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So we have a real problem here,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
no more so than the lions do, the male lions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw
