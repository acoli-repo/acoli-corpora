00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Well then we hit a deep depression,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we seriously submerged the vehicle.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We actually managed to drown

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
two million dollars' worth of camera gear.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We drowned our pride, I must tell you,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which was really serious,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and we seized the engine.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is that he who drowns the vehicle

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
gets to swim with the crocodiles.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(Laughter)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You will notice also that all of these images here

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
are taken from the top angle by Beverly --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the dry top angle, by the way.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)
