(Applause)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now back to the leopard.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We were spending so much time with this leopard

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and getting to understand her individualism,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
her personal character,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We were perhaps taking her for granted,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and maybe she didn't like that that much.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This is about couples working together,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and so I do need to say that within the vehicle

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Beverly sits on the one side
