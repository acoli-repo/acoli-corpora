This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"he who greets with fire,"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But only by getting up close to these animals

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and spending time with them

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
can we actually even reach out

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and dig out these personal characters that they have.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000

And right now this is in the Okavango Delta

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in Botswana.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But also, our hearts are in our throats

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a huge amount of the time,
