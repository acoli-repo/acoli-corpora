00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And we can only work that out

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
as people were seeing parallels

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
between the thuggish side of nature

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and gang warfare.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is doing exactly what his name,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Eetwidomayloh, represents.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He's focused on this hyena,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and he is going to get it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Animal sounds)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But that's, I think, what this is all about,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
