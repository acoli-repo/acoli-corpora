00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this leopard.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
like a super long episode of "CSI" --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
something like 28 years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In essence, what we've done

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we've seen over 2,000 kills

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by these amazing animals.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But one of the things that science really lets us down on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is that personality,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that individual personality that these animals have.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And here's a prime example.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old
