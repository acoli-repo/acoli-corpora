00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the dry top angle, by the way.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
BJ: But we truly do

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
spend day and night

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
trying to capture unique footage.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And 20 years ago,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
we did a film called "Eternal Enemies"

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
where we managed to capture

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
lions and hyenas.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
