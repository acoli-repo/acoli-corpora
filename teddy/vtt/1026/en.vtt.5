00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, we needn't have worried.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
sat next to us, shivering,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And actually from that day on,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
she's been comfortable with us.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So we felt that that day

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
was the day that she really earned her name.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We called her Legadema,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which means, "light from the sky."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in all sorts of animals,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in particular in the cats.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"he who greets with fire,"
