Beverly sits on the one side

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
where all her camera gear is,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and I'm on the other side where my space is.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
These are precious to us, these divides.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
BJ: But when this little cub saw

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that I had vacated my seat

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
she came in like a curious cat

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to come and investigate.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that she trusted us to that extent.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But at the same time, we were concerned

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
that if she created this as a habit

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and jumped into somebody else's car,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
it might not turn out the same way --
