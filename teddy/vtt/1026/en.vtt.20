00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
this little leopard was displaying

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
her individual personality.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But nothing prepared us

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for what happened next in our relationship with her,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
when she started hunting.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.

And of course, we knew now

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that she was going to survive.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
clinging to the mother's fur

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
did we realize that something very unique

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was taking place here with Legadema.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,
