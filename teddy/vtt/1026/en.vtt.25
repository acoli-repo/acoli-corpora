00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and today there are 20,000.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Tigers haven't fared any better --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
45,000

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
down to maybe 3,000.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
all the way down to 12,000.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Leopards have plummeted

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
from 700,000

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
down to a mere 50,000.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Now in the extraordinary time

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
that we have worked with Legadema --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
which is really over a five-year period --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
10,000 leopards were legally shot

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
by safari hunters.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And that's not the only leopards
