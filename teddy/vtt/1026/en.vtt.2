00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
baobab tree in Africa,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the same tree that we found her mother in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and her grandmother.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And she took us on a journey

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and revealed something very special to us --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
her own daughter, eight days old.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And the minute we found this leopard,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we realized that we needed to move in,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and so we basically stayed with this leopard

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for the next four-and-a-half years --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
following her every day,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
getting to know her,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that individual personality of hers,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and really coming to know her.
