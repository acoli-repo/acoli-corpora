Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the African wilderness

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and protecting the African wilderness,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and so what we've done

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is we've focused on iconic cats.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I know,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the light of human suffering and poverty

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and even climate change,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
one would wonder,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
why worry about a few cats?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well today we're here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to share with you a message that we have learned

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from a very important and special character --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this leopard.
