00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.094
the seawater pH goes down.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.697
And this basically means that there
is an increase in ocean acidity.

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:40.470
And this whole process
is called ocean acidification.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:43.630
And it's happening
alongside climate change.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:48.459
Scientists have been monitoring
ocean acidification for over two decades.

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:51.671
This figure is an important
time series in Hawaii,

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:56.591
and the top line shows steadily increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide,

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.131
or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:02.488
And this is directly as a result
of human activities.
