I dread to think what our oceans
will look like when he's a grown man.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.668
We will see acidification.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.070
We have already put too much
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.712
But we can slow this down.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:18.472
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.934
The only way of doing that

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:24.317
is by reducing our
carbon dioxide emissions.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.416
This is important for both you and I,
for industry, for governments.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.371
We need to work together,
slow down global warming
