00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:02.478
So is that what we're headed for?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.420
Well, maybe.

00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:08.523
Studies are showing
some species are actually doing quite well

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:11.538
but many are showing a negative response.

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:17.133
One of the big concerns is
as ocean acidity increases,

00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:21.681
the concentration of carbonate
ions in seawater decrease.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.401
Now these ions are basically
the building blocks

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:28.227
for many marine species
to make their shells,

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.314
for example crabs or mussels, oysters.
