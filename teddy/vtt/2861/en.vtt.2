00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.283
that's causing climate change.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.346
But as we keep pumping
more and more and more

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:07.864
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.483
more is dissolving into the oceans.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.723
And this is what's changing
our ocean chemistry.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.738
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:20.001
it undergoes a number
of chemical reactions.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.585
Now lucky for you,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.895
I don't have time to get into
the details of the chemistry for today.

00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:28.712
But I'll tell you as more
carbon dioxide enters the ocean,

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.094
the seawater pH goes down.
