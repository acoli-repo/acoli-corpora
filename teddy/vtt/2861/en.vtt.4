00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:02.488
And this is directly as a result
of human activities.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.371
The line underneath shows the increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:10.332
that is dissolved
in the surface of the ocean

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:13.537
which you can see is increasing
at the same rate

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.736
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
since measurements began.

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.934
The line on the bottom shows
then shows the change in chemistry.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.785
As more carbon dioxide
has entered the ocean,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.056
the seawater pH has gone down,

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.598
which basically means there has been
an increase in ocean acidity.
