00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.408
So as you can imagine,
in the North Atlantic

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.038
we get hit with some seriously
stormy conditions --

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.782
so not for any of you
who get a little motion sickness,

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.235
but we are collecting
some very valuable data.

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:11.471
So we lower this instrument
over the side of the ship,

00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:13.932
and there are sensors
that are mounted on the bottom

00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:16.630
that can tell us information about
the surrounding water,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.075
such as temperature
or dissolved oxygen.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.265
And then we can collect our seawater
samples in these large bottles.

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.684
So we start at the bottom,
which can be over four kilometers deep

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.566
just off our continental shelf,

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:32.478
and we take samples at regular intervals
right up to the surface.
