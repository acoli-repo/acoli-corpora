00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:02.611
since pre-industrial times,
which is directly due to human activities.

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:07.738
Unless we can start slowing down
our carbon dioxide emissions,

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:13.968
we're expecting an increase
in ocean acidity of 170 percent

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:16.737
by the end of this century.

00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:20.046
I mean this is within
our children's lifetime.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:27.123
This rate of acidification
is 10 times faster

00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:33.569
than any acidification in our oceans
for over 55 million years.
