Now in Ireland, scientists are also
monitoring ocean acidification --

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.073
scientists at the Marine
Institute and NUI Galway.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:42.373
And we, too, are seeing
acidification at the same rate

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:45.405
as these main ocean time-series
sites around the world.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.739
So it's happening right at our doorstep.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.728
Now I'd like to give you an example
of just how we collect our data

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:55.006
to monitor a changing ocean.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.244

in the middle of winter.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.408
So as you can imagine,
