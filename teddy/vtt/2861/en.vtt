00:00:01.627 --> 00:00:05.960
Do you ever think about how important
the oceans are in our daily lives?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.576
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.591
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.690
They moderate our climate.

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:19.832
And they provide jobs
and medicine and food

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:25.125
including 20 percent of protein
to feed the entire world population.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.847
People used to think
that the oceans were so vast

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:31.332
that they wouldn't be affected
by human activities.
