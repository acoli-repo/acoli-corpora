This here is a pteropod,
it's called a sea butterfly.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:06.690
And it's an important food source
in the ocean for many species,

00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:10.475
from krill to salmon right up to whales.

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:14.902
The shell of the pteropod
was placed into seawater

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:18.347
at a pH that we're expecting
by the end of this century.

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:24.696
After only 45 days
at this very realistic pH,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.182
you can see the shell
has almost completely dissolved.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.689
So ocean acidification could affect
right up through the food chain --
