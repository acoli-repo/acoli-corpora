00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:32.478
and we take samples at regular intervals
right up to the surface.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:35.136
We take the seawater back on the deck,

00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:37.650
and then we can either
analyze them on the ship

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.810
or back in the laboratory
for the different chemicals parameters.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.453
But why should we care?

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:47.095
How is ocean acidification
going to affect all of us?

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:51.666
Well, here are the worrying facts.

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:58.579
There has already been an increase
in ocean acidity of 26 percent

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:02.611
since pre-industrial times,
which is directly due to human activities.
