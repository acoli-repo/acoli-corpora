than any acidification in our oceans
for over 55 million years.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.431
So our marine life have never,
ever experienced

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:41.225
such a fast rate of change before.

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:45.450
So we literally could not know
how they're going to cope.

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:51.621
Now there was a natural acidification
event millions of years ago,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.519
which was much slower
than what we're seeing today.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.621
And this coincided with a mass extinction
of many marine species.
