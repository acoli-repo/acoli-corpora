00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:31.332
that they wouldn't be affected
by human activities.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.491
Well today I'm going to tell you
about a serious reality

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:40.148
that is changing our oceans
called ocean acidification,

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.728
or the evil twin of climate change.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.322
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed
25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:51.590
that we have emitted to the atmosphere?

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.608
Now this is just another great service
provided by the oceans

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.502
since carbon dioxide
is one of the greenhouse gases

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.283
that's causing climate change.
