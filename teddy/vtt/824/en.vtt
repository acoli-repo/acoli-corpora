00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We are drowning in news.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Reuters alone puts out

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
three and a half million news stories a year.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's just one source.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My question is: How many of those stories

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are actually going to matter in the long run?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's the idea behind The Long News.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which was founded by TEDsters including

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
