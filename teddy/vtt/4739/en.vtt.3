00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.493
like disappearing disease,
spring dwindle disease

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.515
and autumn collapse.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:38.149
But when in 2006 such losses 
were found to affect

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.443
more than half of all hives in the US,

00:01:40.443 --> 00:01:42.524
the phenomenon got a new name:

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:45.441
colony collapse disorder.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.489
The most frightening thing 
about this mystery

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.994
isn't that we'll have to go back 
to using regular sugar in our tea.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:52.857
We farm bees for their honey,

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:56.118
but they also pollinate our crops 
on an industrial scale,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.962
generating over 1/3 of America's 
food production this way.
