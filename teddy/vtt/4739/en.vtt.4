00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.962
generating over 1/3 of America's 
food production this way.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.940
So, how can we find 
the culprit behind this calamity?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690
Here are three of the possible offenders.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.783
Exhibit A: Pests and Disease.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.710
Most infamous is the varroa mite,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.663
a minuscule red pest that not only 
invades colonies and feeds on bees,

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:19.877
but also transfers pathogens 
that stunt bee growth

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:21.917
and shortens their life span.

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.672
Exhibit B: Genetics.

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:26.924
The queen is the core of a healthy hive.

00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:29.794
But nowadays, the millions 
of queen bees distributed

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:33.795
in commercial hives are bred 
from just a few original queens,
