00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.209
So we have a file full of clues

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.751
but no clear leads.

00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.836
In reality, scientists, 
the actual detectives on this case,

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:08.710
face disagreement over what causes 
colony collapse disorder.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.213
For now, we assume that 
several factors are the cause.

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.140
Honeybees aren't necessarily 
in danger of extinction,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.102
but fewer bees overall means
less pollination and higher food costs,

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:24.355
so it's crucial that scientists solve 
the case of the vanishing bees.

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:26.898
Because while having less honey 
might be a buzzkill,

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:30.319
crop shortages are something
that would truly sting.
