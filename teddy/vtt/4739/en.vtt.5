00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:33.795
in commercial hives are bred 
from just a few original queens,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.378
which raises the worry about 
a lack of genetic diversity

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:40.545
which could weaken bees' defenses 
against pathogens and pests.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:43.398
Exhibit C: Chemicals.

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.937
Pesticides used both
on commercial beehives

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:48.326
and agricultural crops 
to ward off parasites

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:51.796
could be getting into the food 
and water that honeybees consume.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.129
Researchers have even found
that some pesticides

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.295
damage the honeybees' homing abilities.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.209
So we have a file full of clues
