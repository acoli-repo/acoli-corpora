00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.685
But what's particularly eerie

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.569
is that there's no tell-tale mass
of dead or dying bees nearby.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.202
Either they have forgotten
their way back to the hive,

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.534
or they have simply disappeared.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.075
These mysterious
disappearances aren't new.

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:15.786
Humans have been collecting
honey for centuries.

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:18.853
But it wasn't until European settlers
in the 1600's

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:21.440
introduced the subspecies, 
Apis mellifera,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.809
that we domesticated bees.

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:25.160
Since the 19th century,

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.335
beekeepers have reported
occasional mass disappearances,

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:29.985
giving them enigmatic names

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.493
like disappearing disease,
spring dwindle disease
