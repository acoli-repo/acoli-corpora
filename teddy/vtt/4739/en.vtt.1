00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:30.951
The number of domesticated
honeybees in the US

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.799
has been decreasing at an alarming rate.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.666
This decline appears too big

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.824
to be explained by the usual causes
of bee death alone:

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.961
disease, parasites or starvation.

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.347
A typical crime scene
has almost no adult bees left in the hive,

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:50.085
except, perhaps, a lonely queen
and a few other survivors.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.013
It's full of untouched food stores
and a brood of unborn larvae,

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:58.759
suggesting that the adults vacated
without waiting for them to hatch.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.685
But what's particularly eerie
