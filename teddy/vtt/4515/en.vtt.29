We can all change the world.

00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:35.241
I gave you a very small example

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:38.742
of how one thing, the use of color,

00:14:38.742 --> 00:14:41.253
can make change happen.

00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:42.616
I want to make more change

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:45.404
as Prime Minister of my country,

00:14:45.404 --> 00:14:49.726
but every single one of you can make change happen

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.319
if you want to.

00:14:51.319 --> 00:14:54.444
President Roosevelt, he said,

00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:58.117
"Believe you can, and you are halfway there."

00:14:58.117 --> 00:15:01.184
