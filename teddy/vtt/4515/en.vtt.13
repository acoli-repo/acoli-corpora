00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.699
brought about a state of anarchy in the city,

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.610
while the barbarism of the '90s

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.092
brought about a loss of hope for the city.

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:43.362
The paint on the walls did not feed children,

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:47.426
nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:50.867
but it gave hope and light,

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:53.307
and helped to make people see

00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:56.410
there could be a different way of doing things,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.321
a different spirit, a different feel to our lives,
