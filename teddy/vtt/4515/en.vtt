00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.494
In my previous life, I was an artist.

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:06.967
I still paint. I love art.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:12.566
I love the joy that color can give to our lives

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.214
and to our communities,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:20.493
and I try to bring something of the artist in me

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.614
in my politics,

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:26.542
and I see

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:31.726
part of my job today, the reason for being here,
