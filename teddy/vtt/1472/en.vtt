00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But before I do that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which require huge amounts of energy to create

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and, because of their disposal issues,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are slowly poisoning our planet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I also want to tell you and share with you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how my team and I

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have been using mushrooms over the last three years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Not like that. (Laughter)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which perform a lot like plastics during their use,
