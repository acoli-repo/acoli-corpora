I'd say, "Actually, no.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.576
We don't know what you're talking about."

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.560
But here are some things that we do know.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.696
We know that when black women
embrace their love for their natural hair,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.176
it helps to undo generations of teaching

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.496
that black in its natural state
is not beautiful,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.440
or something to be hidden or covered up.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.736
We know that black women
express their individuality

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.856
and experience feelings of empowerment

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.920
by experimenting with different
hairstyles regularly.
