Garrett A. Morgan
and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.160
of the black hair-care and beauty

of chemically-based hair creams

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.016
and heat straightening tools

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.616
designed to permanently,
or semipermanently,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.280
alter the texture of black hair.
