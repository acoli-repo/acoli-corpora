00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.136
living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.040
she wasn't 100 percent sure
what a black person looked like.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.856
That's fair.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.256
But what was more surprising to me was,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.776
in all of this time I had spent
with Jenny and Rosie's family --

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.136
hanging out with them,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.416
playing with them,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.216
even physically interacting with them --

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.736
it was not until Rosie
put her hands in my hair

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.280
that she thought to ask me if I was black.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.256
That was the first time I would realize
