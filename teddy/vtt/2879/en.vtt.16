00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.696
who we still look to as leaders,
icons and role models,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.016
still opt for a straight-hair look.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.256
Now,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.976
maybe it's because they want to --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.296
this is authentically
how they feel best --

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.816
but maybe --

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.456
and I bet --

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.736
a part of them felt like they had to

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.240
in order to reach the level of success
that they have attained today.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.536
There is a natural hair movement
that is sweeping the country

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.840
and also in some places in Europe.
