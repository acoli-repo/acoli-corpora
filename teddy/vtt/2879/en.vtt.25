00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.176
and others like this

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.720
help us to rise above
the confines of the status quo.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.776
So when you see a woman with braids
or locks draping down her back,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.336
or you notice your colleague

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.440
who has stopped
straightening her hair to work,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.936
do not simply approach her and admire

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.776
and ask her if you can touch it --

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.056
(Laughter)

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.920
Really appreciate her.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.136
Applaud her.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.880
Heck, even high-five her
if that's what you feel so inclined to do.
