Heck, even high-five her
if that's what you feel so inclined to do.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.096
Because this --

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.880
this is more than about a hairstyle.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.800
It's about self-love and self-worth.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.816
It's about being brave enough

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.880
not to fold under the pressure
of others' expectations.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.376
And about knowing that making
the decision to stray from the norm

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.856
does not define who we are,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.200
but it simply reveals who we are.
