00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.400
that straighter and longer
hair meant better and more beautiful.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.936
We became culturally obsessed

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.160
with this idea of having
what we like to call ...

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.040
"good hair."

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.256
This essentially means:

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.840
the looser the curl pattern,
the better the hair.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.176
And we let these institutionalized ideas
form a false sense of hierarchy

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.776
that would determine
what was considered a good grade of hair

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.160
and what was not.
