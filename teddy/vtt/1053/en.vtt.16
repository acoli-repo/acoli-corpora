By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
had a plaque on his desk

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
inscribed with this inspirational slogan:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
"What would you attempt to do

Putting fear of failure out of your mind

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
can be a very good thing

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
if you're training for a triathlon

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
or preparing to give a TEDTalk,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but personally, I think people with the power
