00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The process requires a huge amount of water,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That's very bad news for local indigenous people

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
living downstream

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now looking at these images,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which can already be seen from space

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and could grow to an area the size of England.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I find it helps actually

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
the largest ever built.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
That's a person down there by the wheel.
