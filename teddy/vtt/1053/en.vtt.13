00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
this is pure fantasy,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and it's not coming from the climate scientists.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's coming from the economists

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
imposing their mechanistic thinking

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
on the science.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The fact is that we simply don't know

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
when the warming that we create

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
will be utterly overwhelmed

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
by feedback loops.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So once again,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
why do we take these crazy risks

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
with the precious?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
A range of explanations

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
may be popping into your mind by now,
