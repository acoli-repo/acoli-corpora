00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
telling themselves happy stories

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about cakewalks and welcome parades.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Then, it is years of deadly damage control,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Frankensteins of sieges and surges

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000

And when it inevitably does,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the best and the brightest

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --
