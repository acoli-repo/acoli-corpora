00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
than it does to produce conventional oil

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
in Canada.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
How else to describe this,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
This is where our story of endless growth

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
has taken us,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to this black hole at the center of my country --
