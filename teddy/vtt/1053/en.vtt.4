00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And I think what it is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is I don't think we have fully come to terms

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
with the meaning of this disaster,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with our lack of control,
