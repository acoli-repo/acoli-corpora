00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that you are gifted, chosen

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and born to rule

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
has distinct societal downsides.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
brings us closer, I think,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to the root of our collective recklessness.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because none of us -- at least in the global North --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
neither men nor women,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
are fully exempt from this message.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Here's what I'm talking about.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Whether we actively believe them

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or consciously reject them,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
our culture remains in the grips

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of certain archetypal stories

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
about our supremacy
