00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
not the birds.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But they forgot this:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the fact that birds dine on grubs,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that robins eat lots of worms

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
now saturated with DDT.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
songbirds died en masse,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
towns fell silent.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Thus the title "Silent Spring."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I've been trying to pinpoint

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because I'm Canadian,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I can draw no ancestral ties.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And I think what it is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is I don't think we have fully come to terms
