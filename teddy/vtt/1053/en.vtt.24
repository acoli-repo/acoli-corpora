00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
because it was the wealth from this land

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that gave birth to our economic system,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
one that cannot survive without perpetual growth

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and an unending supply

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
of new frontiers.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now the problem is

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that the story was always a lie.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The Earth always did have limits.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
They were just beyond our sights.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And now we are hitting those limits

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
on multiple fronts.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I believe that we know this,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
