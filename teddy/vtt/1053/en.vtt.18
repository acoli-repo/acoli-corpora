00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but studies do show that, as investors,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
women are much less prone

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to taking reckless risks than men,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
precisely because, as we've already heard,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
women tend not to suffer from overconfidence

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in the same way that men do.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So it turns out

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that being paid less and praised less

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
has its upsides --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
for society at least.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The flipside of this

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
is that constantly being told

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that you are gifted, chosen

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and born to rule
