00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but personally, I think people with the power

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
would do better having

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
because -- maybe not that one in particular --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
all of the time.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So we have greed,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
we've got overconfidence/hubris,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
but since we're here at TEDWomen,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
let's consider one other factor

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that could be contributing in some small way

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to societal recklessness.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,
