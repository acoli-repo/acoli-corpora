00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the best and the brightest

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in this case, throwing massive amounts

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of much-needed public money

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
down a very different kind of hole.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
As with BP, the hole does get plugged,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
at least temporarily,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
but not before

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
exacting a tremendous price.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We have to figure out

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
why we keep letting this happen,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because we are in the midst

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
deciding what to do, or not to do,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
about climate change.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now as you know,
