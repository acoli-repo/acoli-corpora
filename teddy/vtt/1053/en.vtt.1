00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're looking at the really little stuff

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what they're finding

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is very bad news,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because so much life depends on it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So contrary to what we heard a few months back

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about how 75 percent of that oil

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
sort of magically disappeared

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we didn't have to worry about it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this disaster is still unfolding.
