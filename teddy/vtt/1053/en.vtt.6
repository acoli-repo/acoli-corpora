00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the carelessness, the lack of planning

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that characterized the operation

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
from drilling to clean-up.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If there is one thing

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
BP's watery improv act made clear,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it is that, as a culture,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we have become far too willing to gamble

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and irreplaceable,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and to do so without a back-up plan,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
without an exit strategy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And BP was hardly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
our first experience of this in recent years.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Our leaders barrel into wars,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
telling themselves happy stories
