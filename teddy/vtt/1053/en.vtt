00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I just did something I've never done before.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I'm not a scientist,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the University of South Florida

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the boat we were on, by the way.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The scientists I was with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the birds, the turtles,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're looking at the really little stuff
