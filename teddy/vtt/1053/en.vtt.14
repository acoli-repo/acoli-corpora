00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
may be popping into your mind by now,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
like "greed."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
because taking big risks, as we all know,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
pays a lot of money.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is hubris.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And greed and hubris

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
are intimately intertwined

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
when it comes to recklessness.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
taking home 100 times more

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
than a brain surgeon,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
then you need a narrative,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you need a story
