00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Not only do we continue to tell and retell

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the same tired stories,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
because God put those resources into the ground

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in order for us to exploit them,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and on the other, glorying in the wilderness
