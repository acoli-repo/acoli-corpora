00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
about climate change.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now as you know,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a great deal of time is spent,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in this country and around the world,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
inside the climate debate,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
are all wrong?"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now a far more relevant question --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is, "What if those scientists are right?"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Given the stakes, the climate crisis

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
clearly calls for us to act

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
based on the precautionary principle --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the theory that holds
