00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the extent that such a thing exists --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is not based on precaution,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but rather on cost-benefit analysis --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
finding the course of action that economists believe

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
will have the least impact

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
on our GDP.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
what can we do as quickly as possible

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to avoid potential catastrophe,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
we ask bizarre questions like this:

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
"What is the latest possible moment we can wait

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Can we put this off till 2020,
