00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
based on the precautionary principle --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the theory that holds

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that when human health and the environment

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are significantly at risk

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and when the potential damage is irreversible,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we cannot afford to wait

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
for perfect scientific certainty.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Better to err on the side of caution.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
More overt, the burden of proving

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that a practice is safe

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
but rather on the industry that stands to profit.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But climate policy in the wealthy world --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the extent that such a thing exists --
