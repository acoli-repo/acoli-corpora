00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
about how that very same Mother Nature

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
is so nurturing and so resilient

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that we can never make a dent in her abundance.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is tiny in relation to the total water volume."

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
In other words, the ocean is big;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
she can take it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that makes it possible

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to take the reckless risks that we do.
