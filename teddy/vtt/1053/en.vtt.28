00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and massive strip-mining operations for coal,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the likes of which we haven't yet seen.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm always surprised by how little

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
people outside of Canada

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
know about the Alberta Tar Sands,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
which this year are projected to become

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the number one source of imported oil

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to the United States.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because I believe it speaks to recklessness

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and the path we're on

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
like little else.
