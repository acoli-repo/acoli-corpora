00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Can we put this off till 2020,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
2030, 2050?"

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Or we ask,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
"How much hotter can we let the planet get

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and still survive?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
where we're currently going --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
four degrees Celsius?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And by the way,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the assumption that we can safely control

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the Earth's awesomely complex climate system

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as if it had a thermostat,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
making the planet not too hot, not too cold,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --
