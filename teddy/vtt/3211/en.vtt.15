00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.576
less than one-one hundredth
the width of a human hair

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.416
that contain chlorophyl.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.800
That was Prochlorococcus.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.800
So remember this slide that I showed you?

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.296
If you shine blue light
on that same sample,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.520
this is what you see:

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.136
two tiny little red light-emitting cells.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.280
Those are Prochlorococcus.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.800
They are the smallest and most abundant
photosynthetic cell on the planet.

00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.976
At first, we didn't know what they were,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.776
so we called the "little greens."
