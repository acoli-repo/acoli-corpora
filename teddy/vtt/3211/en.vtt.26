00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.160
but even its evolutionary history.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.416
As we studied -- I said we've
sequenced hundreds of these cells,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.296
and we can now project

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.456
what is the total genetic size --

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.696
gene pool --

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.216
of the Prochlorococcus
federation, as we call it.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.896
It's like a superorganism.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.536
And it turns out that projections are

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.576
that the collective has 80,000 genes.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.536
That's four times the size
of the human genome.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.976
And it's that diversity of gene pools
