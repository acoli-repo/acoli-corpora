00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.696
that you don't need a weather app --
you just need an umbrella.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.936
So --

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.136
(Laughter)

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.856
(Applause)

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.816
So just as your smartphone tells us
something about how you live your life,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.136
your lifestyle,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.776
reading the genome
of a Prochlorococcus cell

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.840
tells us what the pressures are
in its environment.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.656
It's like reading its diary,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.456
not only telling us how it got
through its day or its week,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.160
but even its evolutionary history.
