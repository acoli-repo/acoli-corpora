00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.296
And about that time, it became
possible to sequence their genomes

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.920
and really look under the hood
and look at their genetic makeup.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.696
And we've been able to sequence
the genomes of cultures that we have,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.096
but also recently, using flow cytometry,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.976
we can isolate
individual cells from the wild

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.176
and sequence their individual genomes,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.080
and now we've sequenced
hundreds of Prochlorococcus.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.776
And although each cell
has roughly 2,000 genes --

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.376
that's one tenth the size
of the human genome --
