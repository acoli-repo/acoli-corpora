Your heart is beating
using the solar energy

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.016
that some plant processed for you,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.456
and the stuff your body is made out of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.096
is made out of CO2

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.560
that some plant processed for you.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.760
Basically, we're all made
out of sunlight and carbon dioxide.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.696
Fundamentally, we're just hot air.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040
(Laughter)

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.256
So as terrestrial beings,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.336
we're very familiar
with the plants on land:

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.976
the trees, the grasses,
the pastures, the crops.
