00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.376
that's one tenth the size
of the human genome --

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.856
as you sequence more and more,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.576
you find that they only have
a thousand of those in common

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.696
and the other thousand
for each individual strain

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.296
is drawn from an enormous gene pool,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.936
and it reflects the particular environment
that the cell might have thrived in,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.936
not just high or low light
or high or low temperature,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.736
but whether there are
nutrients that limit them

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.216
like nitrogen, phosphorus or iron.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.760
It reflects the habitat
that they come from.
