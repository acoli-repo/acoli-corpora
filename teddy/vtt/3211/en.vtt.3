00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.056
and use it to build sugars
and proteins and amino acids,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.480
all the things that life is made of.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.656
And as they evolved and grew more and more

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.736
over millions and millions of years,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.840
that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.976
Until about 500 million years ago,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.696
there was enough in the atmosphere
that larger organisms could evolve.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.656
There was an explosion of life-forms,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.240
and, ultimately, we appeared on the scene.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.320
While that was going on,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.656
some of those ancient
photosynthesizers died
