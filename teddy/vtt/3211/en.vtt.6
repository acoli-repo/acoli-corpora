the trees, the grasses,
the pastures, the crops.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.816
But the oceans are filled
with billions of tons of animals.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.200
Do you ever wonder what's feeding them?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.776
Well there's an invisible pasture

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.576
of microscopic photosynthesizers
called phytoplankton

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.240
that fill the upper
200 meters of the ocean,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.416
and they feed the entire
open ocean ecosystem.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.856
Some of the animals
live among them and eat them,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.416
and others swim up
to feed on them at night,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.416
while others sit in the deep
and wait for them to die and settle down
