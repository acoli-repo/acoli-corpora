00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.336
it could inspire designs

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.296
that could reduce
our dependency on fossil fuels,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.120
which brings my story full circle.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.056
The fossil fuels that are buried
that we're burning

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.896
took millions of years
for the earth to bury those,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.936
including those ancestors
of Prochlorococcus,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.856
and we're burning that now
in the blink of an eye

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.816
on geological timescales.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.736
Carbon dioxide is increasing
in the atmosphere.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.336
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.456
The oceans are starting to warm.
