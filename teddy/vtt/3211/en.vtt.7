00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.416
while others sit in the deep
and wait for them to die and settle down

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.964
and then they chow down on them.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.416
So these tiny phytoplankton,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.576
collectively, weigh less than
one percent of all the plants on land,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.896
but annually they photosynthesize
as much as all of the plants on land,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.336
including the Amazon rainforest

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.560
that we consider the lungs of the planet.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.256
Every year, they fix
50 billion tons of carbon

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.536
in the form of carbon dioxide
into their bodies

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.240
that feeds the ocean ecosystem.
