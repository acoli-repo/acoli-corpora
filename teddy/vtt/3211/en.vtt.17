00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.775
So over the years,
we and others, many others,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.176
have studied Prochlorococcus
across the oceans

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.776
and found that they're very abundant
over wide, wide ranges

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.440
in the open ocean ecosystem.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.776
They're particularly abundant
in what are called the open ocean gyres.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.536
These are sometimes referred to
as the deserts of the oceans,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.576
but they're not deserts at all.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.136
Their deep blue water is teeming
