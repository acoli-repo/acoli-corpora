00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.176
thinking about what
a masterpiece they are,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.096
finely tuned by millions
of years of evolution.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120
With 2,000 genes,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.416
they can do what
all of our human ingenuity

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.696
has not figured out how to do yet.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.696
They can take solar energy, CO2

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.216
and turn it into chemical energy
in the form of organic carbon,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.520
locking that sunlight
in those carbon bonds.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.296
If we could figure out
exactly how they do this,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.336
it could inspire designs
