But they're in there,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.840
and I'm going to reveal them
to you in a minute.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.120
But first I want to tell you
how they were discovered.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.216
About 38 years ago,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.016
we were playing around with a technology
in my lab called flow cytometry

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.520
that was developed for biomedical research

And here's how it works:
