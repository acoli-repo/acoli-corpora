00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.656
some of those ancient
photosynthesizers died

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.360
and were compressed and buried,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.256
and became fossil fuel

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.416
with sunlight buried
in their carbon bonds.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.120
They're basically buried sunlight
in the form of coal and oil.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.656
Today's photosynthesizers,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.336
their engines are descended
from those ancient microbes,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.600
and they feed basically
all of life on earth.
