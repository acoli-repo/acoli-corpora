00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.240
a large, powerful laser

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.976
with a money-back guarantee
from the company

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.936
that if it didn't work on a ship,
they would take it back.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.976
And so a young scientist
that I was working with at the time,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.576
Rob Olson, was able
to take this thing apart,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.456
put it on a ship, put it back together
and take it off to sea.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.816
And it worked like a charm.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.976
We didn't think it would,
because we thought the ship's vibrations

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.376
would get in the way
of the focusing of the laser,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.056
but it really worked like a charm.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.576
And so we mapped the phytoplankton
distributions across the ocean.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.216
For the first time, you could look at them
one cell at a time in real time
