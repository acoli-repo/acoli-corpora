00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.456
The oceans are starting to warm.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.216
So the question is,
what is that going to do

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.736
for my Prochlorococcus?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.696
And I'm sure you're expecting me to say
that my beloved microbes are doomed,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.040
but in fact they're not.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.616
Projections are that their populations
will expand as the ocean warms

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.520
to 30 percent larger by the year 2100.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.400
Does that make me happy?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.976
Well, it makes me happy
for Prochlorococcus of course --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.296
