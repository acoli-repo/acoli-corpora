I'd like to introduce you
to a tiny microorganism

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.616
that you've probably never heard of:

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.616
its name is Prochlorococcus,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840
and it's really an amazing little being.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.576
For one thing, its ancestors

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.416
changed the earth in ways
that made it possible for us to evolve,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.496
and hidden in its genetic code

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.296
is a blueprint

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.600
that may inspire ways to reduce
our dependency on fossil fuel.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.336
But the most amazing thing
