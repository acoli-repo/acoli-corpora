00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.496
And so we used this instrument
for several years

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.336
to study our phytoplankton cultures,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.976
species like those charismatic
ones that I showed you,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200
just studying their basic cell biology.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.096
But all that time, we thought,
well wouldn't it be really cool

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.936
if we could take an instrument
like this out on a ship

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.656
and just squirt seawater through it

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.416
and see what all those diversity
of phytoplankton would look like.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.536
So I managed to get my hands

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.776
on what we call a big rig
in flow cytometry,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.240
a large, powerful laser
