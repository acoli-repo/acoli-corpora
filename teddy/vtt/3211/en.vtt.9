00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.296
So there are thousands
of different species of phytoplankton,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.496
come in all different shapes and sizes,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.776
all roughly less than the width
of a human hair.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.376
Here, I'm showing you
some of the more beautiful ones,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.880
the textbook versions.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.880
I call them the charismatic
species of phytoplankton.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.120
And here is Prochlorococcus.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.656
I know,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.616
it just looks like a bunch
of schmutz on a microscope slide.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.216
(Laughter)

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.056
But they're in there,
