00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.776
so we called the "little greens."

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.776
It was a very affectionate name for them.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.416
Ultimately, we knew enough about them
to give them the name Prochlorococcus,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.656
which means "primitive green berry."

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.120
And it was about that time

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.256
that I became so smitten
by these little cells

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.400
that I redirected my entire lab
to study them and nothing else,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.776
and my loyalty to them
has really paid off.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.360
They've given me a tremendous amount,
including bringing me here.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.240
