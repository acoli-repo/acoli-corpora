00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.600
Think of it this way.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.296
If each cell is a smartphone

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.240
and the apps are the genes,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.536
when you get your smartphone,
it comes with these built-in apps.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.776
Those are the ones that you can't delete
if you're an iPhone person.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.856
You press on them and they don't jiggle
and they don't have x's.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.496
Even if you don't want them,
you can't get rid of them.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.096
(Laughter)

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.256
Those are like the core genes
of Prochlorococcus.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.336
They're the essence of the phone.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.336
But you have a huge pool
of apps to draw upon
