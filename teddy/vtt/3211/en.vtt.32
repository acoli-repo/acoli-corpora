So Prochlorococcus has been
my muse for the past 35 years,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.456
but there are legions
of other microbes out there

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.640
maintaining our planet for us.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.416
They're out there

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.696
ready and waiting for us to find them
so they can tell their stories, too.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.936
Thank you.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.560
