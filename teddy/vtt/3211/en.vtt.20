00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.616
and there are some that are adapted
to the low light in the deep ocean.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.216
In fact, those cells that live
in the bottom of the sunlit zone

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.016
are the most efficient
photosynthesizers of any known cell.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.376
And then we learned
that there are some strains

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.816
that grow optimally along the equator,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.576
where there are higher temperatures,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.976
and some that do better
at the cooler temperatures

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.256
as you go north and south.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.976
So as we studied these more and more
and kept finding more and more diversity,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.440
we thought, oh my God,
how diverse are these things?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.296
And about that time, it became
possible to sequence their genomes
