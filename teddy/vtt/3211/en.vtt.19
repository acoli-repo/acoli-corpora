00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.096
And collectively, they weigh
more than the human population

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.080
and they photosynthesize
as much as all of the crops on land.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.520
They're incredibly important
in the global ocean.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.616
So over the years,
as we were studying them

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.816
and found how abundant they were,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.776
we thought, hmm, this is really strange.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.640
How can a single species be so abundant
across so many different habitats?

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.656
And as we isolated more into culture,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.816
we learned that they
are different ecotypes.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.736
There are some that are adapted
to the high-light intensities

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.016
in the surface water,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.616
and there are some that are adapted
to the low light in the deep ocean.
