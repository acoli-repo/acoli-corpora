00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.816
teeming with life,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480
teeming with plants and animals?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.760
Well, in a word, photosynthesis.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.176
About two and a half billion years ago,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.136
some of these ancient ancestors
of Prochlorococcus evolved

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.496
so that they could use solar energy

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.816
and absorb it

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.856
and split water into its component parts
of oxygen and hydrogen.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.296
And they used the chemical energy produced

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.216
to draw CO2, carbon dioxide,
out of the atmosphere

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.056
and use it to build sugars
and proteins and amino acids,
