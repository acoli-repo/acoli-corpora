00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.336
But you have a huge pool
of apps to draw upon

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.096
to make your phone custom-designed
for your particular lifestyle and habitat.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.936
If you travel a lot,
you'll have a lot of travel apps,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.776
if you're into financial things,
you might have a lot of financial apps,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.336
or if you're like me,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.296
you probably have a lot of weather apps,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.936
hoping one of them will tell you
what you want to hear.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.296
(Laughter)

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.696
And I've learned the last
couple days in Vancouver

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.696
that you don't need a weather app --
you just need an umbrella.
