00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.296
(Laughter)

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.720
but not for the planet.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.856
There are winners and losers

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.136
in this global experiment
that we've undertaken,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.136
and it's projected that among the losers

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.216
will be some of those
larger phytoplankton,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.536
those charismatic ones

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.376

to be reduced in numbers,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.896
and they're the ones that feed
the zooplankton that feed the fish

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.320
that we like to harvest.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.056
So Prochlorococcus has been
my muse for the past 35 years,
