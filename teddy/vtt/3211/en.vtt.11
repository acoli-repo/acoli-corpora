00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.256
And here's how it works:

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.520
so you inject a sample
in this tiny little capillary tube,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.336
and the cells go single file by a laser,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.416
and as they do, they scatter light
according to their size

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.096
and they emit light according
to whatever pigments they might have,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.736
whether they're natural
or whether you stain them.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.120
And the chlorophyl of phytoplankton,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.496
which is green,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.256
emits red light
when you shine blue light on it.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.496
And so we used this instrument
for several years
