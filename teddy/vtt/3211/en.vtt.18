00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.136
Their deep blue water is teeming

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.560
with a hundred million
Prochlorococcus cells per liter.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.976
If you crowd them together
like we do in our cultures,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.536
you can see their beautiful
green chlorophyl.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.176
One of those test tubes
has a billion Prochlorococcus in it,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.656
and as I told you earlier,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.856
there are three billion billion billion
of them on the planet.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.096
That's three octillion,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.800
if you care to convert.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.176
(Laughter)

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.096
And collectively, they weigh
more than the human population
