00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.626
just to really describe
the challenge ahead,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.021
and why this technology is not just
going to improve health care

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.735

This is a child that's born, young girl.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:12.225
"Day of life zero," we call it,

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.548

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:29.179
And the reason for this
is displayed in this chest X-ray.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.514
That's called a babygram,
