00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.960
in the health care system
that I trained for over 20 years,

00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:32.169
what currently exists,

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:35.137
the model of training is called
the apprenticeship model.

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.076
It's been around for centuries.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.048
It's based on this idea that you see
a surgery maybe once,

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.600
maybe several times,

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:45.414
you then go do that surgery,

00:03:45.438 --> 00:03:48.996
and then ultimately you teach
that surgery to the next generation.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:53.192
And implicit in this model --

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.390
I don't need to tell you this --

00:03:55.414 --> 00:04:00.371
is that we practice on the very patients
that we are delivering care to.
