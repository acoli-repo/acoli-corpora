is that we practice on the very patients
that we are delivering care to.

00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:03.982
That's a problem.

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:09.473
I think there's a better approach.

00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:13.862
Medicine may very well be the last
high-stakes industry

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.608
that does not practice prior to game time.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.490
I want to describe to you a better
approach through medical simulation.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.696
Well, the first thing we did is we went
to other high-stakes industries

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.590
that had been using this type
of methodology for decades.
