00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:33.637
and cause a little hole in a membrane
that allows all that fluid to drain,

00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.709
much like it would in a sink.

00:08:35.733 --> 00:08:38.848
All of a sudden, the brain
is no longer under pressure,

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:40.329
can re-expand

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.232
and we cure the child
through a single-hole incision.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:46.073
But here's the problem:

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:48.241
hydrocephalus is relatively rare.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.320
And there are no good training methods

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:54.968
to get really good at getting
this scope to the right place.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:59.306
But surgeons have been quite creative
about this, even our own.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.338
And they've come up with training models.
