00:11:58.182 --> 00:12:02.651
What I'm about to show you
is a reproduction of this child.

00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:12.300
You'll notice here that every hair
on the child's head is reproduced.

00:12:12.324 --> 00:12:16.027
And in fact, this is also
that reproduced child --

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:19.244
and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,

00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:22.128
but that is a reproduction and simulation

00:12:22.152 --> 00:12:24.246
of the child they're about to operate on.

00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:28.931
Here's that membrane we had talked about,

00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:31.114
the inside of this child's brain.
