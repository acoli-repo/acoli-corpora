00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.999
we place catheters into the major
vessels of the neck --

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:34.717
and I can tell you that these vessels
are about the size of a pen,

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.646
the tip of a pen --

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.754
and then we have blood
drawn from the body,

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:41.186
we bring it through a machine,
it gets oxygenated,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.062
and it goes back into the body.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.662
We save her life,

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:47.210
and get her safely to the operating room.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.328
Here's the problem:

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.445
these disorders --

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.758
what is known is congenital
diaphragmatic hernia --

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:00.378
this hole in the diaphragm that has
allowed these intestines to sneak up --
