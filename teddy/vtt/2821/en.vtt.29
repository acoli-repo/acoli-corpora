00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:32.997
STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,
8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.

00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:35.422
STM 6: Great! Thank you.

00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:38.169
Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:40.285
The second step to this,
which is critical,

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.408
is we take these teams out
immediately and debrief them.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:44.896
We use the same technologies

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.608
that are used in Lean
and Six Sigma in the military,

00:14:49.632 --> 00:14:52.717
and we bring them out
and talk about what went right,

00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:54.386
but more importantly,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.877
we talk about what didn't go well,

00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:58.836
and how we're going to fix it.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.614
Then we bring them right back in
and do it again.
