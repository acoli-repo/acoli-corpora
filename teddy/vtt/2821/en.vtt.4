00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.711
The fix for this problem

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:03.389
is to take this child immediately
to the operating room,

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.544
bring those intestines
back into the abdomen,

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:06.983
let the lungs expand

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:08.888
and allow this child to breathe again.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:11.546
But before she can go
to the operating room,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.862
she must get whisked away
to the ICU, where I work.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.754
I work with surgical teams.

00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:18.080
We gather around her,

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:22.205
and we place this child
on heart-lung bypass.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.217
We put her to sleep,

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.837
we make a tiny
little incision in the neck,

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.999
we place catheters into the major
vessels of the neck --
