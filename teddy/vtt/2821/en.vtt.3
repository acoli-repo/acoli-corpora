00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.514
That's called a babygram,

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:33.812
a full X-ray of a child's body,
a little infant's body.

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:35.742
As you look on the top side of this,

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.249
that's where the heart and lungs
are supposed to be.

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:41.050
As you look at the bottom end,
that's where the abdomen is,

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:43.496
and that's where the intestines
are supposed to be.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.249
And you can see how
there's sort of that translucent area

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.444
that made its way up into the right side
of this child's chest.

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:53.476
And those are the intestines --
in the wrong place.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.670
As a result, they're pushing on the lungs

00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:58.665
and making it very difficult
for this poor baby to breathe.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.711
The fix for this problem
