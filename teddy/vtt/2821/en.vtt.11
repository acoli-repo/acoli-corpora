You think about a baseball team:
baseball players practice.

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:36.429
I think it's a beautiful example
of progressive training.

00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:39.213
The first thing they do
is go out to spring training.

00:05:39.237 --> 00:05:41.501
They go to a spring training camp,

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:44.044
perhaps a simulator in baseball.

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.614
They're not on the real field,
but they're on a simulated field,

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.671
and they're playing in the pregame season.

00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:53.192
Then they make their way to the field
during the season games,

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:56.314
and what's the first thing they do
before they start the game?

00:05:56.338 --> 00:06:00.769
They go into the batting cage
and do batting practice for hours,
