00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:02.253
and the reason for this problem is here --

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.927
it's called hydrocephalus.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.423
So, a quick study in neurosurgery.

00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:08.612
There's the brain,

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.184
and you can see the cranium
surrounding the brain.

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.993
What surrounds the brain,
between the brain and cranium,

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.235
is something called
cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.993
which acts as a shock absorber.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:21.908
In your heads right now,

00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:25.189
there is cerebrospinal fluid
just bathing your brains

00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:27.039
and making its way around.

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.689
It's produced in one area
and flows through,

00:07:29.713 --> 00:07:31.004
and then is re-exchanged.
