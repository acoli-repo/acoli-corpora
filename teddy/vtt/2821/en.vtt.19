00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:31.460
the rudimentary components
of doing this surgery.

00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:34.552
Then they head right into
the apprenticeship model,

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:37.448
seeing many of them
as they present themselves,

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:39.735
then doing it, and then teaching it --

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.776
waiting for these patients to arrive.

00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:44.066
We can do a lot better.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.817
We are manufacturing
reproductions of children

00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.747
in order for surgeons and surgical
teams to rehearse

00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:55.151
in the most relevant possible ways.

00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:56.550
Let me show you this.

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:58.654
Here's my team

00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:02.583
in what's called the SIM Engineering
Division of the Simulator Program.
