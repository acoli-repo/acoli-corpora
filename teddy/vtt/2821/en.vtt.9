00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.279
This is nuclear power.

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:36.344
Nuclear power runs scenarios
on a regular basis

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:39.585
in order to practice
what they hope will never occur.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.960
And as we're all very familiar,
the airline industry --

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:47.281
we all get on planes now,
comforted by the idea

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:53.101
that pilots and crews have trained
on simulators much like these,

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.686
training on scenarios
that we hope will never occur,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.890
but we know if they did,

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:00.427
they would be prepared for the worst.
