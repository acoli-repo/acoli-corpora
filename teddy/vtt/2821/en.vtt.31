00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.396
and brought that team
to the virtual bedside,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.007
to a simulated bedside --

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:36.572
the same team that's going to operate
on this child in the hours ahead --

00:15:36.596 --> 00:15:38.979
and we have them do the procedure.

00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:41.271
Let me show you a moment of this.

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:44.372
This is not a real incision.

00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:47.651
And the baby has not yet been born.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.481
Imagine this.

00:15:52.133 --> 00:15:56.021
So now the conversations
that I have with families

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.745
in the intensive care unit
at Boston Children's Hospital

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:00.157
are totally different.
