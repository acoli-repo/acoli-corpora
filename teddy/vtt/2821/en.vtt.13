The batter steps out of the box

00:06:32.277 --> 00:06:34.320
and takes a practice swing.

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:36.169
He wouldn't do it any other way.

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:40.807
I want to talk to you about how
we're building practice swings like this

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.986
in medicine.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.192

neurologic milestones,

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:02.253
and the reason for this problem is here --
