00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:31.433
depending on the surgery itself,

00:10:31.457 --> 00:10:35.348
and then take this digital data
and be able to output it

00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:39.120
on state-of-the-art,
three-dimensional printing devices

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:41.414
that allow us to print the components

00:10:41.438 --> 00:10:47.106
exactly to the micron detail of what
the child's anatomy will look like.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.434
You can see here,

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.892
the skull of this child being printed

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.402
in the hours before
we performed this surgery.

00:10:54.618 --> 00:10:57.194
But we could not do this work

00:10:57.218 --> 00:11:01.605
without our dear friends on the West Coast
in Hollywood, California.
