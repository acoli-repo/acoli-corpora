WEBVTT

00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:00.572
we've brought it into the operating room
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:14:00.596 --> 00:14:04.251
and these individuals --
these native teams, operative teams --

00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:07.798
are doing the surgery before the surgery.

00:14:07.822 --> 00:14:09.559
Operate twice;

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:10.789
cut once.

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:12.515
Let me show that to you.

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:16.530
(Video) Surgical team member 1:
You want the head down or head up?

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:18.258
STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?

00:14:18.282 --> 00:14:20.931
STM 3: And then lower
the whole table down a little bit?

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:22.209
STM 4: Table coming down.

00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:27.561
STM 3: All right, this
is behaving like a vessel.

00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:29.672
Could we have the scissors back, please?

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:32.997
STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,
8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.
