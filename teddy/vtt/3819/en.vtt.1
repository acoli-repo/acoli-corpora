00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:33.593
decided to broadcast live coverage
of a seven-hour train ride --

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:35.894
seven hours of simple footage,

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:38.123
a train rolling down the tracks.

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:41.985
Norwegians, more than a million of them
according to the ratings, loved it.

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:44.901
A new kind of reality TV show was born,

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.036
and it goes against all the rules
of TV engagement.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:50.476
There is no story line, no script,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.519
no drama, no climax,

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.443
and it's called Slow TV.

00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:55.915
For the past two months,

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.507
Norwegians have been watching 
a cruise ship's journey up the coast,

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:01.566
and there's a lot of fog on that coast.
