00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.771
So we caught our commissioning editors 
in Oslo, and we said,

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.758
we want to make a documentary
about the Bergen Railway,

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:36.710
and we want to make it in full length,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.064
and the answer was,

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:39.999
"Yes, but how long will the program be?"

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.857
"Oh," we said, "full length."

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:43.349
"Yes, but we mean the program."

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.456
And back and forth.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:50.943
Luckily for us, they met us with laughter,
very, very good laughter,

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.629
so one bright day in September,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.615
we started a program that we thought
should be seven hours and four minutes.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:00.479
Actually, it turned out
to be seven hours and 14 minutes
