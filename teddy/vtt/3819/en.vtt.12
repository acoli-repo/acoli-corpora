00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:00.245
We wanted to do something different.

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.526
The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.616
So when we sat in our editing room,

00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:08.220
we watched this picture --
it's all Ål Station --

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.728
we saw this journalist.

00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:11.681
We had called him, we had spoken to him,

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:13.537
and when we left the station,

00:06:13.537 --> 00:06:16.728
he took this picture of us
and he waved to the camera,

00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:18.188
and we thought,

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:21.440
what if more people knew
that we were on board that train?

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.286
Would more people show up?

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:25.259
What would it look like?

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.789
So we decided our next project,
it should be live.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.694
We wanted this picture of us on the fjord
and on the screen at the same time.
