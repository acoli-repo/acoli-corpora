00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:00.489
This is the five biggest TV channels
in Norway on a normal Friday,

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.788
and if you look at NRK2 over here,

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:06.184
look what happened when they put on
the Bergen Railway show:

00:04:06.984 --> 00:04:10.709
1.2 million Norwegians
watched part of this program.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.034
(Applause)

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:16.810
And another funny thing:

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.757
When the host on our main channel,

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:21.224
after they have got news for you,

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:23.662
she said, "And on our second channel,

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:26.657
the train has now
nearly reached Myrdal station."

00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:29.350
Thousands of people
just jumped on the train

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.366
on our second channel like this.
