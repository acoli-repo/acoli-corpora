Thomas Hellum: And then follows
an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.876
about some strange
TV programs in little Norway.

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:37.934
Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.954
We have to go back to 2009,

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:41.953
when one of my colleagues
got a great idea.

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:43.756
Where do you get your ideas?

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:45.237
In the lunchroom.

00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:48.714
So he said, why don't we make
a radio program

00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:52.299
marking the day of the German invasion
of Norway in 1940.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.343
We tell the story at the exact time
during the night.

00:01:56.343 --> 00:01:58.507
Wow. Brilliant idea, except

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:01.410
this was just a couple of weeks
before the invasion day.
