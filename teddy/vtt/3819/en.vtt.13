We wanted this picture of us on the fjord
and on the screen at the same time.

00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:38.355
So this is not the first time
NRK had been on board a ship.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:40.073
This is back in 1964,

00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.929
when the technical managers
have suits and ties

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:46.969
and NRK rolled all its equipment
on board a ship,

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:51.009
and 200 meters out of the shore,
transmitting the signal back,

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.957
and in the machine room,
they talked to the machine guy,

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:59.110
and on the deck, they have
splendid entertainment.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.289
So being on a ship, 
it's not the first time.
