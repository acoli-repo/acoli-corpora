00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:30.417
It's not all bad news, though.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:34.817
There are many ways to reverse
what cortisol does to your stressed brain.

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:38.713
The most powerful weapons are exercise
and meditation,

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:40.376
which involves breathing deeply

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:43.521
and being aware 
and focused on your surroundings.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:46.255
Both of these activities 
decrease your stress

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:49.525
and increase the size of the hippocampus,

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:51.770
thereby improving your memory.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.470
So don't feel defeated 
by the pressures of daily life.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.228
Get in control of your stress
before it takes control of you.
