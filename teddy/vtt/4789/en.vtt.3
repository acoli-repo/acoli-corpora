00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.489
your brain's fear center.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.413
And as levels of cortisol rise,

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:34.760
electric signals in your hippocampus,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.421
the part of the brain associated with
learning, memories, and stress control,

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.054
deteriorate.

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:45.229
The hippocampus also inhibits
the activity of the HPA axis,

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.511
so when it weakens,

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.982
so does your ability 
to control your stress.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:51.322
That's not all, though.

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:55.880
Cortisol can literally cause your brain
to shrink in size.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.703
Too much of it results in the loss
of synaptic connections between neurons
