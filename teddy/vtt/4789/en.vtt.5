The effects of stress may filter
right down to your brain's DNA.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.497
An experiment showed

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:38.706
that the amount of nurturing 
a mother rat provides its newborn baby

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:43.878
plays a part in determining how that baby
responds to stress later in life.

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:48.336
The pups of nurturing moms turned out
less sensitive to stress

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.769
because their brains developed 
more cortisol receptors,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.757
which stick to cortisol
and dampen the stress response.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:58.223
The pups of negligent moms
had the opposite outcome,

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:01.910
and so became more sensitive to stress
throughout life.
