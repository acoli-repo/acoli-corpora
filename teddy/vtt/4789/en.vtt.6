00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:01.910
and so became more sensitive to stress
throughout life.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.675
These are considered epigenetic changes,

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.524
meaning that they effect 
which genes are expressed

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:10.514
without directly changing 
the genetic code.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:14.361
And these changes can be reversed
if the moms are swapped.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.123
But there's a surprising result.

00:03:16.123 --> 00:03:19.788
The epigenetic changes caused by
one single mother rat

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.622
were passed down to many generations
of rats after her.

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:28.077
In other words, the results 
of these actions were inheritable.

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:30.417
It's not all bad news, though.
