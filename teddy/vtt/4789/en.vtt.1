00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.086
But when its continuous,

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:33.105
the kind most of us face day in
and day out,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.932
it actually begins to change your brain.

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.152
Chronic stress,

00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:41.235
like being overworked
or having arguments at home,

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.778
can affect brain size,

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:43.966
its structure,

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.249
and how it functions,

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.249
right down to the level of your genes.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.980
Stress begins with something called

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.606
the hypothalamus pituitary
adrenal axis,

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.698
a series of interactions


00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:59.579
between endocrine glands in the brain
and on the kidney,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.500
which controls 
your body's reaction to stress.
