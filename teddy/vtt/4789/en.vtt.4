00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.703
Too much of it results in the loss
of synaptic connections between neurons

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.267
and the shrinking 
of your prefrontal cortex,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.871
the part of your brain the regulates
behaviors like concentration,

00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.253
decision-making,

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.379
judgement,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.620
and social interaction.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.437
It also leads to fewer new brain cells
being made in the hippocampus.

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:19.925
This means chronic stress 
might make it harder for you to learn

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.401
and remember things,

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.324
and also set the stage for more serious
mental problems,

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:28.875
like depression
and eventually Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:33.181
The effects of stress may filter
right down to your brain's DNA.
