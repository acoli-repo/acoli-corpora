00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:14.218
In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk
once a week for 8 consecutive weeks,

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:16.345
each time on a different 
alcoholic beverage,

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.515
and each time with precisely 
the same dosageâ€”

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.101
this was science,
after all.

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:26.189
The goal of this experiment was to find
out which alcoholic drinks

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.066
cause worse hangovers.

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:32.528
Of course, it takes much more than one 
small study to answer such a question.
