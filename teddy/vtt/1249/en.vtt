00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.478
Thank you. I have to tell you
I'm both challenged and excited.

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:08.414
My excitement is: I get a chance
to give something back.

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:11.976
My challenge is: the shortest seminar
I usually do is 50 hours.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.625
(Laughter)

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.879
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:18.138
I do more, obviously,
I also coach people --

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.933
but I'm into immersion,
because how did you learn language?

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:22.562
Not just by learning principles,

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:25.439
you got in it and you did it
so often that it became real.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:28.940
The bottom line of why I'm here,
besides being a crazy mofo, is that --

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.703
I'm not here to motivate you,
you don't need that, obviously.
