I'm here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.254
All of us here have great minds.

00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:06.706
Most of us here have great minds, right?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.090
We all know how to think.

00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:11.203
With our minds we can
rationalize anything.

00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:12.569
We can make anything happen.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.371
I agree with what was described
a few days ago,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.722
that people work in their self-interest.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:20.364
But we know that that's bullshit at times.

00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:22.752
You don't work in your
self-interest all the time,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.643
because when emotion comes into it,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.710
the wiring changes
in the way it functions.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.685
So it's wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is,
