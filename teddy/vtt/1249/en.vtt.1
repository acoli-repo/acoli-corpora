I'm not here to motivate you,
you don't need that, obviously.

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:34.750
Often that's what people think I do,

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:36.489
and it's the furthest thing from it.

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.558
What happens, though, is people say to me,

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.050
"I don't need any motivation."

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.617
But that's not what I do.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.508
I'm the "why" guy.

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:45.604
I want to know why you do what you do.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.453
What is your motive for action?

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.313
What is it that drives you
in your life today? Not 10 years ago.

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:53.042
Are you running the same pattern?

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.978
Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive, activated,

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.810
is the most important thing.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:02.413
I'm here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.
