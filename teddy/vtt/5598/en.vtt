00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:11.745
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their 
coronation to thunderous applause.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.341
After receiving his ornate 
crown and scepter,

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:19.401
Henry Christophe ascended his throne, 
towering 20 meters in the air.

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:23.249
But little did the cheering onlookers 
know that the first king of Haiti

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.976
would also be its last.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:28.681
Enslaved at birth on the 
island of Grenada,

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.517
Christophe spent his childhood being 
moved between multiple Caribbean islands.
