00:00:00.513 --> 00:00:04.243
Today we have a frabjous treat for you.

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:07.680
This poem is full of seemingly 
nonsensical words

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.470
that somehow manage to make sense.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.950
Ready to see if you can follow along?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.060
Without further ado, we present:

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.175
"Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:26.409
â€™Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.409
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
