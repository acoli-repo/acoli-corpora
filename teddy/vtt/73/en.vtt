OK, I want to take a moment
to let each of you think to yourselves

00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:10.118
about the last time
you sent or received a fax.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.602
(Laughter)

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.746
Well, for me, it was this morning,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.885
because one piece of my work

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.253
is making sure that everyone in the US
has the information that they need

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:23.290
to make decisions
about the candidates on their ballot.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.826
And collecting that information

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.188
from the local government offices
responsible for maintaining it

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:31.920
means sending and receiving
a lot of faxes.
