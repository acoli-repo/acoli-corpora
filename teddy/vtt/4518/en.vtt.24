00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:01.007
people hate it ...

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:04.965
because they think you're deliberately
creating delays at the bridge

00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:06.643
in order to maximize your revenue,

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:10.055
and, "Why on earth should I pay
to subsidize your incompetence?"

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:12.556
On the other hand,
change the frame slightly

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.871
and create charitable yield management,

00:12:14.895 --> 00:12:18.029
so the extra money you get
goes not to the bridge company,

00:12:18.053 --> 00:12:19.244
it goes to charity ...

00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:23.056
and the mental willingness
to pay completely changes.

00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:26.771
You have a relatively
economically efficient solution,

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:29.114
but one that actually meets
with public approval

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:31.138
and even a small degree of affection,
