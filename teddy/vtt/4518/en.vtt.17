It's proven to reduce
the accident rate in experiments.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:33.296
Why?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.841
Because road rage, impatience and general
irritation are massively reduced

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:40.714
when you can actually see
the time you have to wait.

00:08:40.738 --> 00:08:43.641
In China, not really understanding
the principle behind this,

00:08:43.665 --> 00:08:46.404
they applied the same principle
to green traffic lights --

00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:50.266
(Laughter)

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.812
which isn't a great idea.

00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:54.926
You're 200 yards away, you realize
you've got five seconds to go,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.102
you floor it.

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:59.449
(Laughter)

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.974
The Koreans, very assiduously,
did test both.
