00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.142
that the Germans and the French
are doing a brilliant job

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.620
of creating a united Europe.

00:17:03.644 --> 00:17:06.514
The only thing they didn't expect
is they're uniting Europe

00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:09.536
through a shared mild hatred
of the French and Germans.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.610
But I'm British;
that's the way we like it.

00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.759
(Laughter)

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.220
What you'll also notice
is that, in any case,

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.434
our perception is leaky.

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:20.336
We can't tell the difference
between the quality of the food

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.373
and the environment
in which we consume it.

00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:24.435
All of you will have seen this phenomenon

00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:26.441
if you have your car washed or valeted.

00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:29.586
When you drive away,
your car feels as if it drives better.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.951
(Laughter)
