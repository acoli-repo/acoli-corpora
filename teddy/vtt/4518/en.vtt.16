00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:02.612
they put dot matrix display boards
on the platforms --

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:07.468
because the nature of a wait is not just
dependent on its numerical quality,

00:08:07.492 --> 00:08:08.735
its duration,

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:12.173
but on the level of uncertainty
you experience during that wait.

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:15.086
Waiting seven minutes for a train
with a countdown clock

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.003
is less frustrating and irritating

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:19.966
than waiting four minutes,
knuckle biting, going,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.278
"When's this train
going to damn well arrive?"

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.436
Here's a beautiful example
of a psychological solution

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.631
deployed in Korea.

00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:29.064
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.114
It's proven to reduce
the accident rate in experiments.
