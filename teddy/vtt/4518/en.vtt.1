00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.886
And the reason, I only worked out
just the other day,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.578
which is: when you go
to a drinks party and you stand up

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.562
and hold a glass of red wine
and you talk endlessly to people,

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.160
you don't actually want to spend
all the time talking.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:40.655
It's really, really tiring.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.692
Sometimes you just want to stand there
silently, alone with your thoughts.

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:48.718
Sometimes you just want to stand
in the corner and stare out of the window.

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:52.821
Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:56.496
if you stand and stare
out of the window on your own,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.742
you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.076
(Laughter)
