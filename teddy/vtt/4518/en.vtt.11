00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:30.891
So people who believed in psychological
solutions didn't have a model.

00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:32.850
We didn't have a framework.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:36.221
This is what Warren Buffett's
business partner Charlie Munger calls

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:38.606
"a latticework on which
to hang your ideas."

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:42.320
Engineers, economists,
classical economists

00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:45.275
all had a very, very robust
existing latticework

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.994
on which practically
every idea could be hung.

00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:51.414
We merely have a collection
of random individual insights

00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:52.839
without an overall model.

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:58.051
And what that means
is that, in looking at solutions,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.801
we've probably given too much priority
