00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.119
and there's human feces on the floor.

00:15:30.143 --> 00:15:31.552
(Laughter)

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:34.069
The best thing you can do there
to create value

00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:37.109
is not actually to improve
the food still further,

00:15:37.133 --> 00:15:39.932
it's to get rid of the smell
and clean up the floor.

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:44.812
And it's vital we understand this.

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:47.483
If that seems like a sort
of strange, abstruse thing --

00:15:47.507 --> 00:15:51.405
in the UK, the post office
had a 98 percent success rate

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.613
at delivering first-class
mail the next day.

00:15:54.192 --> 00:15:56.077
They decided this wasn't good enough,

00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:57.893
and they wanted to get it up to 99.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:02.607
The effort to do that
almost broke the organization.
