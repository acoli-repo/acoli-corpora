believes we should spend far less time
looking into humanity's hidden depths,

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:07.109
and spend much more time
exploring the hidden shallows.

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:08.645
I think that's true, actually.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.743
I think impressions have an insane effect
on what we think and what we do.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.350
But what we don't have is a really
good model of human psychology --

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:19.659
at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,

00:05:19.683 --> 00:05:22.647
we didn't have a really good model
of human psychology

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:27.544
to put alongside models of engineering,
of neoclassical economics.

00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:30.891
So people who believed in psychological
solutions didn't have a model.
