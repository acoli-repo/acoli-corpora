almost broke the organization.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.910
If, at the same time,
you'd gone and asked people,

00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:08.753
"What percentage of first-class mail
arrives the next day?"

00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:12.683
the average answer, or the modal answer,
would have been "50 to 60 percent."

00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:16.095
Now, if your perception
is much worse than your reality,

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:19.143
what on earth are you doing
trying to change the reality?

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:22.782
That's like trying to improve the food
in a restaurant that stinks.

00:16:24.362 --> 00:16:27.080
What you need to do is,
first of all, tell people

00:16:27.104 --> 00:16:31.611
that 98 percent of first-class mail
gets there the next day.
