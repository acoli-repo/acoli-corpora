00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:31.138
and even a small degree of affection,

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:33.351
rather than being seen as bastardy.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.158
So where economists
make the fundamental mistake

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:39.147
is they think that money is money.

00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:44.506
Actually, my pain experienced
in paying five pounds

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.677
is not just proportionate to the amount,

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:48.685
but where I think that money is going.

00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:52.310
And I think understanding that
could revolutionize tax policy.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:54.337
It could revolutionize
the public services.

00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:56.874
It could actually change things
quite significantly.

00:12:56.898 --> 00:12:58.360
[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]

00:12:58.384 --> 00:13:00.098
Here's a guy you all need to study.
