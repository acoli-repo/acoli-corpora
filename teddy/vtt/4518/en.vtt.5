And that's because having a son
who's unemployed in Manchester

00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:33.503
is really quite embarrassing.

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.605
But having a son
who's unemployed in Thailand

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.712

There's an experiment
I think Daniel Pink refers to,

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.702
where you put two dogs in a box
