00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:33.494
he referred to strange economists
called the French physiocrats,

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:37.148
who believed that the only true value
was what you extracted from the land.

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.657
So if you're a shepherd
or a quarryman or a farmer,

00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:41.102
you created true value.

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:43.985
If however, you bought
some wool from the shepherd

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.990
and charged a premium
for converting it into a hat,

00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:48.796
you weren't actually creating value,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.580
you were exploiting the shepherd.

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:55.162
Now, Von Mises said that modern
economists make exactly the same mistake

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.243
with regard to advertising and marketing.

00:14:57.577 --> 00:14:59.459
He says if you run a restaurant,

00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:01.722
there is no healthy distinction to be made
