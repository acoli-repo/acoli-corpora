00:16:27.104 --> 00:16:31.611
that 98 percent of first-class mail
gets there the next day.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:33.156
That's pretty good.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.388
I would argue, in Britain,
there's a much better frame of reference,

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.779
which is to tell people that more
first-class mail arrives the next day

00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:42.518
in the UK than in Germany,
because generally, in Britain,

00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:44.826
if you want to make us happy
about something,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.042
just tell us we do it
better than the Germans.

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:48.796
(Laughter)

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.072
(Applause)

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:54.317
Choose your frame of reference
and the perceived value,

00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:57.747
and therefore, the actual value
is completely transformed.

00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.416
It has to be said of the Germans

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.142
that the Germans and the French
are doing a brilliant job
