I think uses an analogy which is probably
the best justification and explanation

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:05.743
for the value of marketing,
the value of perceived value

00:14:05.767 --> 00:14:09.044
and the fact that we should treat it
as being absolutely equivalent

00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:10.551
to any other kind of value.

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:14.006
We tend to, all of us, even those of us
who work in marketing,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.328
think of value in two ways:

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:18.249
the real value, which is when
you make something in a factory

00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:19.427
or provide a service,

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.069
and then there's a dubious value,

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:23.904
which you create by changing
the way people look at things.

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:26.222
Von Mises completely rejected
this distinction.

00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:28.137
And he used this following analogy:

00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:33.494
he referred to strange economists
called the French physiocrats,
