00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:01.722
there is no healthy distinction to be made

00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:04.299
between the value you create
by cooking the food

00:15:04.323 --> 00:15:06.626
and the value you create
by sweeping the floor.

00:15:07.203 --> 00:15:09.693
One of them creates, perhaps,
the primary product --

00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:11.582
the thing we think we're paying for --

00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:14.447
the other one creates a context
within which we can enjoy

00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:15.995
and appreciate that product.

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:19.191
And the idea that one of them
should have priority over the other

00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.365
is fundamentally wrong.

00:15:20.944 --> 00:15:22.611
Try this quick thought experiment:

00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:25.286
imagine a restaurant
that serves Michelin-starred food,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.957
but where the restaurant smells of sewage

00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.119
and there's human feces on the floor.
