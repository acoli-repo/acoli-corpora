What would happen if you could actually
pay twice as much money

00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:34.145
to cross the bridge,

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:36.288
but go through a lane
that's an express lane?

00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:38.082
It's not an unreasonable thing to do;

00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:40.117
it's an economically
efficient thing to do.

00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:42.182
Time means more
to some people than others.

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:44.637
If you're waiting trying
to get to a job interview,

00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:48.875
you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more
to go through the fast lane.

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:51.228
If you're on the way
to visit your mother-in-law,

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.403
you'd probably prefer --

00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:53.610
(Laughter)

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.768
you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:59.833
The only problem is if you introduce
this economically efficient solution,

00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:01.007
people hate it ...
