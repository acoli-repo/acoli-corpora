00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.702
where you put two dogs in a box

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:03.939
and the box has an electric floor.

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:09.785
Every now and then,
an electric shock is applied to the floor,

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.636
which pains the dogs.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.498
The only difference is one of the dogs
has a small button in its half of the box.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:20.316
And when it nuzzles the button,
the electric shock stops.

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:23.880
The other dog doesn't have the button.

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:28.145
It's exposed to exactly the same level
of pain as the dog in the first box,

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.043
but it has no control
over the circumstances.
