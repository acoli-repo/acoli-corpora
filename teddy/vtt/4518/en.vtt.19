00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:31.511
you'll nearly always see all of these
three things coming into play.

00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:33.218
Really successful businesses --

00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:35.904
Google is a great, great
technological success,

00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:39.127
but it's also based
on a very good psychological insight:

00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:42.651
people believe something
that only does one thing

00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.834
is better at that thing than something
that does that thing and something else.

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:49.564
It's an innate thing
called "goal dilution."

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:52.349
Ayelet Fishbach has written
a paper about this.

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:54.863
Everybody else at the time
of Google, more or less,

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:56.134
was trying to be a portal.

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.984
Yes, there's a search function,
but you also have weather,

00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:00.666
sports scores, bits of news.
