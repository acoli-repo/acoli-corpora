I think the danger
we have in today's world

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.781
is we have the study of economics

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:35.835
considers itself to be a prior discipline
to the study of human psychology.

00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:38.828
But as Charlie Munger says,
"If economics isn't behavioral,

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:40.399
I don't know what the hell is."

00:13:41.804 --> 00:13:47.605
Von Mises, interestingly, believes
economics is just a subset of psychology.

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:49.534
I think he just refers to economics

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:52.838
as "the study of human praxeology
under conditions of scarcity."

00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:56.838
But Von Mises, among many other things,

00:13:56.862 --> 00:14:01.512
I think uses an analogy which is probably
the best justification and explanation
