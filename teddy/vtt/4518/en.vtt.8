00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:01.907
which is the level of control
we have over our tax money,

00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.567
that what costs us 10 pounds
in one context can be a curse;

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:11.193
what costs us 10 pounds in a different
context, we may actually welcome.

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:16.618
You know, pay 20,000 pounds
in tax toward health,

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:18.571
and you're merely feeling a mug.

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:21.857
Pay 20,000 pounds
to endow a hospital ward,

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.747
and you're called a philanthropist.

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.318
I'm probably in the wrong country
to talk about willingness to pay tax.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:30.029
