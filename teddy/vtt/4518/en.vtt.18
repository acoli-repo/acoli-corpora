The Koreans, very assiduously,
did test both.

00:09:01.998 --> 00:09:05.333
The accident rate goes down
when you apply this to red traffic lights;

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:07.945
it goes up when you apply it
to green traffic lights.

00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:10.907
This is all I'm asking for, really,
in human decision making,

00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:13.036
is the consideration
of these three things.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.025
I'm not asking for the complete primacy
of one over the other.

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:18.289
I'm merely saying
that when you solve problems,

00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:20.795
you should look
at all three of these equally,

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:23.020
and you should seek as far as possible

00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:25.903
to find solutions which sit
in the sweet spot in the middle.

00:09:25.927 --> 00:09:27.898
If you actually look at a great business,

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:31.511
you'll nearly always see all of these
three things coming into play.
