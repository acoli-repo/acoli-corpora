00:06:53.433 --> 00:07:00.067
an asymmetry in the way we treat creative,
emotionally driven psychological ideas

00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:04.992
versus the way we treat rational,
numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:07.483
If you're a creative person,
I think, quite rightly,

00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:09.642
you have to share
all your ideas for approval

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:11.603
with people much more rational than you.

00:07:11.627 --> 00:07:14.891
You have to go in
and have a cost-benefit analysis,

00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.968
a feasibility study,
an ROI study and so forth.

00:07:17.992 --> 00:07:19.734
And I think that's probably right.

00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:23.289
But this does not apply
the other way around.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:25.341
People who have an existing framework --

00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:27.744
an economic framework,
an engineering framework --

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:30.934
feel that, actually,
logic is its own answer.
