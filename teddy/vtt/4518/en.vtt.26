Here's a guy you all need to study.

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:01.727
He's an Austrian School economist

00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:06.315
who was first active in the first half
of the 20th century in Vienna.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.531
What was interesting
about the Austrian School

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:11.588
is they actually grew up alongside Freud.

00:13:11.612 --> 00:13:14.265
And so they're predominantly
interested in psychology.

00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:18.842
They believed that there was
a discipline called praxeology,

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:21.462
which is a prior discipline
to the study of economics.

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:25.934
Praxeology is the study of human choice,
action and decision-making.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.985
I think they're right.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:30.077
I think the danger
we have in today's world
