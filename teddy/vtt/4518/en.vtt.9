(Laughter)

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:35.253
So I'll give you one in return:
how you frame things really matters.

00:04:35.277 --> 00:04:37.555
Do you call it "The bailout of Greece"?

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:40.775
Or "The bailout of a load of stupid banks
which lent to Greece"?

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:41.810
(Laughter)

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.184
Because they are actually the same thing.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:48.068
What you call them
actually affects how you react to them,

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:50.126
viscerally and morally.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.344
I think psychological value is great,
to be absolutely honest.

00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:56.240
One of my great friends,
a professor called Nick Chater,

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:59.138
who's the Professor of Decision
Sciences in London,

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:03.662
believes we should spend far less time
looking into humanity's hidden depths,
