00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.801
we've probably given too much priority

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:04.946
to what I call technical engineering
solutions, Newtonian solutions,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.348
and not nearly enough
to the psychological ones.

00:06:07.372 --> 00:06:09.685
You know my example of the Eurostar:

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:10.907
six million pounds spent

00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:14.151
to reduce the journey time
between Paris and London

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:15.613
by about 40 minutes.

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.417
For 0.01 percent of this money,
you could have put wi-fi on the trains,

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.109
which wouldn't have reduced
the duration of the journey,

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:27.052
but would have improved its enjoyment
and its usefulness far more.

00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:29.693
For maybe 10 percent of the money,

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:33.051
you could have paid all of the world's top
male and female supermodels
