00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and usually what I’m talking about

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it is not requisite to know how to make it.
