00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:30.409
Because nowadays, we have
interactive content, like video games,

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:33.448
that have hundreds of hours
of interactive game plays,

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.585
but only two hours of music, on average.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.101
And it means that the music
loops and loops and loops

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.457
over and over again,
and it's not very immersive.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:44.418
So what we're working on
is to make sure that AI can compose

00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:46.744
hundreds of hours of personalized music

00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:50.634
for those use cases
where human creativity doesn't scale.

00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:53.569
And we don't just want
to do that for games.

00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:59.085
Beethoven actually wrote a piece
for his beloved, called "Für Elise,"

00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:02.760
and imagine if we could
bring back Beethoven to life.
