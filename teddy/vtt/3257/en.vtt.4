00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:00.855
So those category labels are like mood

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.799
or note density or composer
style of a piece

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.347
or the epoch during which it was written.

00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:08.306
And by seeing all this data,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.386
AIVA can actually respond
to very precise requirements.

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:15.069
Like the ones, for example,
we had for a project recently,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.128
where we were commissioned
to create a piece

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:21.179
that would be reminiscent
of a science-fiction film soundtrack.

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:26.339
And the piece that was created
is called "Among the Stars"

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:29.680
and it was recorded
with CMG Orchestra in Hollywood,

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:31.418
under great conductor John Beal,
