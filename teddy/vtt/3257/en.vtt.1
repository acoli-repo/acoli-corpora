00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.823
And I decided to create an AI composer.

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:36.335
Her name is AIVA,
and she's an artificial intelligence

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.752
that has learned the art
of music composition

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:41.561
by reading over 30,000 scores
of history's greatest.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.621
So here's what one score
looks like to the algorithm

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.847
in a matrix-like representation.

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.117
And here's what 30,000 scores,

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.237
written by the likes
of Mozart and Beethoven,

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.292
look like in a single frame.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.949
So, using deep neural networks,
AIVA looks for patterns in the scores.
