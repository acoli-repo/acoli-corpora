either with our musical ear
or our musical knowledge.

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:37.638
But for AIVA, this process
is taken from years and years of learning,

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:40.924
decades of learning as an artist,
as a musician and a composer,

00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:42.681
down to a couple of hours.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.910
But music is also a supersubjective art.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.498
And we needed to teach AIVA

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:49.967
how to compose the right music
for the right person,

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:52.132
because people have different preferences.

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:56.346
And to do that, we show to the algorithm
over 30 different category labels

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.315
for each score in our database.

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:00.855
So those category labels are like mood
