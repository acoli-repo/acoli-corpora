About two and a half years ago,
I watched this movie called "Her."

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.492
And it features Samantha,
a superintelligent form of AI

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:11.276
that cannot take physical form.

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:14.088
And because she can't
appear in photographs,

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:16.128
Samantha decides to write a piece of music

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:19.618
that will capture a moment of her life
just like a photograph would.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:25.361
As a musician and an engineer,
and someone raised in a family of artists,

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:29.561
I thought that this idea of musical
photographs was really powerful.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.823
And I decided to create an AI composer.
