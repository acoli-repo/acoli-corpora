00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.823
And from a couple of bars
of existing music,

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.555
it actually tries to infer what notes
should come next in those tracks.

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.385
And once AIVA gets good
at those predictions,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.022
it can actually build a set
of mathematical rules

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:15.212
for that style of music

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:18.024
in order to create
its own original compositions.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.199
And in a way, this is kind of
how we, humans, compose music, too.

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.053
It's a trial-and-error process,

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:27.085
during which we may not
get the right notes all the time.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.498
But we can correct ourselves,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.815
either with our musical ear
or our musical knowledge.
