00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:30.233
and every individual in the world

00:05:30.257 --> 00:05:33.331
can have access to a personalized
live soundtrack,

00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:35.860
based on their story
and their personality.

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:41.994
So this moment here together at TED
is now part of our life story.

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:46.187
So it only felt fitting that AIVA
would compose music for this moment.

00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:49.118
And that's exactly what we did.

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:54.458
So my team and I worked on biasing AIVA
on the style of the TED jingle,

00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:57.926
and on music that makes us feel
a sense of awe and wonder.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.863
And the result is called
"The Age of Amazement."
