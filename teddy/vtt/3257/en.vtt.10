00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:02.760
and imagine if we could
bring back Beethoven to life.

00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:08.014
And if he was sitting next to you,
composing a music for your personality

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:09.371
and your life story.

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:13.411
Or imagine if someone like
Martin Luther King, for example,

00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:15.474
had a personalized AI composer.

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:16.871
Maybe then we would remember

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.951
"I Have a Dream" not only
as a great speech,

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:21.601
but also as a great piece of music,
part of our history,

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.758
and capturing Dr. King's ideals.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.958
And this is our vision at AIVA:

00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:28.560
to personalize music
so that each and every one of you

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:30.233
and every individual in the world
