00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:03.291
I'm Amir Nizar Zuabi.

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:05.168
I was born in East Jerusalem,

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:06.669
in a tough part of town

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.923
between Beit Hanina neighborhood
and the Shu'fat refugee camp.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.009
I'm a mixed child,

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.345
that means my mother is Jewish
and my father is Palestinian.

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:20.516
So the refugee experience runs
very deep in the DNA of the family.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.772
When my Jewish grandparents were fleeing
Europe because of World War II,

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:27.398
they came to Palestine

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:30.485
and drove the other part
of my family into exile.
