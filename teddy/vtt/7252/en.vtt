00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.643
In the early months of the pandemic,

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.059
chef José Andrés circulated two photos

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.309
that have come to symbolize
a modern American food crisis.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.434
The first shows mountains of potatoes

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:13.934
that have been left to rot
in a field in Idaho.

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.684
The restaurants and cafeterias
and stadiums that had consumed them

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:19.976
were shuttered during the pandemic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.184
The second shows a devastating scene
outside of the San Antonio food bank.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.976
Thousands of carloads of people lined up,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.351
waiting for food with not enough
supply to go around.
