00:10:58.898 --> 00:11:01.205
So there's this gap in what we know,

00:11:01.229 --> 00:11:04.180
just because no one was there
to ask a question.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:09.488
There's one final reason that I think
talking about gross stuff is so important,

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:12.900
and that's because you just never know
what you're going to find

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.448
when you peel back all those layers
of disgustingness.

00:11:17.122 --> 00:11:20.902
So, take the California brown sea hare.

00:11:21.297 --> 00:11:24.995
This is a sea slug that squirts
this lovely, bright purple ink

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.106
at any creature that tries to eat it.

00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:31.175
But it also happens to be
one of the kinkiest creatures
