00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:31.149
But truthfully, we all spend
sort of a big part of our lives

00:07:31.173 --> 00:07:33.576
just trying not to be gross.

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:35.443
When you really think about it,

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:40.942
we're sort of just like bags of fluids
and some weird tissues

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.648
surrounded by a thin layer of skin.

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:46.553
And to a certain extent,

00:07:46.577 --> 00:07:50.688
multiple times a day, whether
consciously or subconsciously,

00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:54.338
I need to remind myself
not to fart publicly.

00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:55.895
(Laughter)

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.776
You know, we're desperately trying
to avoid being gross all the time,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.653
so I think many of us take
this kind of voyeuristic delight
