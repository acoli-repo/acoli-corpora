I think really little kids
are like little explorers.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:33.815
They just want to experience
as much as they can

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.982
and don't have any idea
about the relative acceptability

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.903
of touching a ladybug versus a stinkbug.

00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.482
They just want to understand
how everything works

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.910
and experience as much
of life as they can.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.234
And that is pure curiosity.

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:50.229
But then adults step in,

00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:55.384
and we tell kids not to pick their noses
and not to touch the slugs or toads

00:03:55.408 --> 00:03:57.680
or whatever else they find
in the backyard,

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.196
because those things are gross.

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:02.379
And we do that in part
to keep kids safe, right?
