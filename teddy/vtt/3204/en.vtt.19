00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:33.229
when it's about something
as common as periods.

00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:37.506
Last February, I released
a video on menstruation,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.943
and to this day,
I am still getting messages

00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:45.889
from people around the globe
who are asking me about their periods.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:51.839
There are a lot of young people --
and some not-so-young people -- out there,

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:54.498
who are worried that
what's happening to their bodies

00:09:54.522 --> 00:09:56.228
is somehow not normal.

00:09:56.252 --> 00:09:59.689
And, of course, I always tell them
that I am not a medical professional,

00:09:59.713 --> 00:10:02.276
and that, if possible,
they should talk to a doctor.
