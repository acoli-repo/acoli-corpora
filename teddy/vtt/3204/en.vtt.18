It has millions of views.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:02.823
(Laughter)

00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:08.514
And the comment section for that video
became sort of like a self-help section,

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:11.376
where people could talk about
their tonsil stone experiences

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.885
and, like, tips and tricks
for getting rid of them.

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:17.327
And I think it became this great way
for people to talk about something

00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:20.125
that they'd never felt comfortable
taking about publicly.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:26.086
And that is wonderful when it's about
something as goofy as tonsil stones,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.585
but it's a little sad when a video
can have an effect like that

00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:33.229
when it's about something
as common as periods.
