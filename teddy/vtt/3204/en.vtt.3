00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:33.099
So fascinated, in fact,
that I started a weekly YouTube series

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:34.926
called "Gross Science,"

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.061
all about the slimy, smelly,
creepy underbelly

00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:41.608
of nature, medicine and technology.

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:44.188
Now, I think most of us would agree

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:47.060
that there's something
a little gross about pee.

00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:50.165
You know, it's something
that we don't really like to talk about,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.585
and we keep the act
of doing it very private.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.125
But when Lunenfeld
peered into the world of pee,

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.704
he discovered something
deeply helpful to humanity.
