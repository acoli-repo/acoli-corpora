00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.029
and cultured the bacteria we'd collected,

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.212
and we dissected owl pellets,

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:08.601
which are these balls of material
that are undigested that owls barf up,

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.412
and it's really kind of gross
and awesome and cool.

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:14.983
Now, the fact that I was obsessed
with gross stuff as a kid

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:16.403
is not so revolutionary.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:19.212
You know, lots of kids
are really into gross things,

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:24.811
like playing in dirt or collecting beetles
or eating their boogers.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.731
And why is that?

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:30.652
I think really little kids
are like little explorers.
