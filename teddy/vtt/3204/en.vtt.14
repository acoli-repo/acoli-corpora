00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:02.736
and there are networks of fungus
beneath your feet

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.887
that are connecting literally
all of the plants around you.

00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.244
That's really amazing.

00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:11.302
So I feel like we should be talking
about gross stuff early and often

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:12.486
with young people,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.886
so they feel like they're actually
allowed to claim this bigger picture

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.821
of life on our planet.

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:22.410
The good news is that for many of us,
the fascination with gross stuff

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:24.355
doesn't exactly go away,

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.839
we just kind of pretend
like it's not there.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:31.149
But truthfully, we all spend
sort of a big part of our lives
