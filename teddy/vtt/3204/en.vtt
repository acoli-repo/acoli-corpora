Did you know that one
of the first fertility drugs

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.309
was made from the pee of Catholic nuns,

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.603
and that even the Pope got involved?

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.961
So, this is totally true.

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:19.903
Back in the 1950s, scientists knew
that when women enter menopause,

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:24.450
they start releasing high levels
of fertility hormones in their urine.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:27.090
But there was this doctor
named Bruno Lunenfeld,

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:31.314
who wondered if he could actually
isolate those hormones from the urine
