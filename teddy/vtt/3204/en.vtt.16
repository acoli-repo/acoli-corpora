00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.653
so I think many of us take
this kind of voyeuristic delight

00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:04.340
in learning about gross things.

00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:06.541
This is certainly true of kids;

00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:09.179
the number of middle school teachers
who show my videos

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:10.381
in their science classes

00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:11.624
is a testament to that.

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:14.355
But I think it's totally true
of adults, too.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.570
You know, I think we all love
hearing about gross stories,

00:08:17.594 --> 00:08:23.148
because it's a socially acceptable way
to explore the gross side of ourselves.

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:25.738
But there's this other reason

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:28.334
that I think talking about
gross stuff is so important.

00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:33.514
A while back, I made a video
on tonsil stones -- sorry, everyone --
