00:11:59.224 --> 00:12:00.821
when you think about it.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.960
(Laughter)

00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:07.641
But if scientists had only seen this
and they were like,

00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:10.577
"OK, we're just not going to
touch that with a stick,"

00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.569
they would have missed
the bigger thing about sea hares

00:12:13.593 --> 00:12:15.283
that makes them really remarkable.

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:21.904
It turns out that these sea hares
have a small number of very large neurons,

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:26.158
which makes them excellent
to use in neuroscience research.

00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:30.733
And, in fact, the scientist Eric Kandel
used them in his research
