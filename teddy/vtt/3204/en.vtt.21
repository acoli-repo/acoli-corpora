while making the video on periods,

is that I was talking to this
one scientist who told me

00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:44.283
there's actually still a lot

In part, that's just because there weren't
a lot of scientists in the field

00:10:52.607 --> 00:10:55.398
who were women, to ask questions about it.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:58.874

00:10:58.898 --> 00:11:01.205
So there's this gap in what we know,
