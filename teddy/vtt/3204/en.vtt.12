So during puberty,
our bodies are changing,

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.383
and we're sweating more,
and girls get their periods,

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:09.566
and we're thinking about sex
in this way that we never did before.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.828
And through the human capacity
for abstraction,

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.014
this shame can settle in.

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:17.498
So we don't necessarily just think,

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:20.729
"Oh, my goodness, something
really gross is happening to my body!"

00:06:20.753 --> 00:06:24.394
We think, "Oh my God, maybe I'm gross.

00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:28.596
And maybe that means that there's
something bad or wrong about me."

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:34.260
The thing is, that if you de facto
associate gross stuff with immorality,
