00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:31.175
But it also happens to be
one of the kinkiest creatures

00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:32.732
in the animal kingdom.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.993
So these guys are hermaphrodites,

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:38.196
which means they have both
male and female genitalia.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.958
And when it's time to mate,

00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:45.307
up to 20 individuals will all get together
in this kind of, like, conga line

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:47.217
and they'll all mate together.

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:48.653
(Laughter)

00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:54.503
A single sea hare will inseminate
the partner in front of it

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:56.789
and receive sperm from the one behind,

00:11:56.813 --> 00:11:59.200
which is sort of like
an awesome time-saver,

00:11:59.224 --> 00:12:00.821
when you think about it.
