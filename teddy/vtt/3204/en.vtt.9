00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:32.919
So, lots of kids of a certain age
will have burping competitions

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:35.899
or competitions to see
who can make the grossest face.

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:40.002
And they do that in part because
it's a little bit transgressive, right?

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:44.410
But there's another layer
to why we define stuff as gross.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:50.870
As humans, we've sort of extended
the concept of disgust to morality.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:54.347
So, the psychologist Paul Rozin would say

00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.656
that many of the things
we categorize as gross

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.806
are things that reminds us
that we're just animals.
