And, in fact, the scientist Eric Kandel
used them in his research

00:12:30.757 --> 00:12:34.307
to understand how memories are stored.

00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:35.672

He won a Nobel Prize for his work.

00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:44.267
So go out there and pick up beetles

00:12:50.627 --> 00:12:53.833
And as I say at the end of all my videos,

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.063
"Ew."

00:12:55.087 --> 00:12:56.492
Thank you.

00:12:56.516 --> 00:12:58.731
