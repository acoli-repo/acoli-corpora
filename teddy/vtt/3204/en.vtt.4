he discovered something
deeply helpful to humanity.

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:04.768
And after a year and a half
of making my show,

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:09.346
I can tell you that very often
when we explore the gross side of life,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.516
we find insights that we never
would have thought we'd find,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.294
and we even often reveal beauty
that we didn't think was there.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.098
I think it's important for us to talk
about gross things for a few reasons.

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:23.845
So, first of all,
talking about gross stuff

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.543
is a great tool for education,

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.892
and it's an excellent way
to preserve curiosity.
