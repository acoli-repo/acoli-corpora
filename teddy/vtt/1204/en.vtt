00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Unless we do something to prevent it,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A cheery thought.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
On this map, every country that’s colored blue

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the world we live in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And this is the world your children will live in.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.
