00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling --

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and have them surrender to wonder.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
it reaches you almost to a cellular level.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Do unto others what's been done to you.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
The best stories infuse wonder.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
When I was four years old,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I have a vivid memory
