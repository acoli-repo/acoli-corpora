"You see that stone wall out there?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."

"You see that pier on the lake out there?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I built that pier with my bare hands.

Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But you fuck one goat ... "
