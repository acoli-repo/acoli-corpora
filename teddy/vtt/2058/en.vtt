00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A tourist is backpacking

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
through the highlands of Scotland,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and he stops at a pub to get a drink.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the only people in there is a bartender

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and an old man nursing a beer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"You see this bar?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I built this bar with my bare hands

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
from the finest wood in the county.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Gave it more love and care than my own child.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Points out the window.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"You see that stone wall out there?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.
