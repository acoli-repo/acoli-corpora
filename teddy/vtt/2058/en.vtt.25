Off the bed.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Hey, off the bed!

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Woody: No, he is.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Get up here and do your job.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000

Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I don't think what you did was right.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
You don't think I was right?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?
