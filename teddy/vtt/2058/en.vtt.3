00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of who we are as human beings.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We all love stories.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We're born for them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Stories affirm who we are.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And nothing does a greater affirmation

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
than when we connect through stories.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It can cross the barriers of time,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
past, present and future,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and allow us to experience

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the similarities between ourselves

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and through others, real and imagined.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
always carried in his wallet
