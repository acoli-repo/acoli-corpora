00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a quote from a social worker

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
once you've heard their story."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And the way I like to interpret that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is probably the greatest story commandment,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which is "Make me care" --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
please, emotionally,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
intellectually, aesthetically,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
just make me care.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We all know what it's like to not care.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
just switching channel after channel,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.
