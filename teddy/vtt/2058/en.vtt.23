00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And the irony is that, in the first year,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
our story was not working at all

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and Disney was panicking.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So they privately got advice

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
from a famous lyricist, who I won't name,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and he faxed them some suggestions.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And we got a hold of that fax.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And the fax said,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
there should be songs,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
there should be an "I want" song,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
there should be a happy village song,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
there should be a love story

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and there should be a villain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And thank goodness

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That just gave us more determination
