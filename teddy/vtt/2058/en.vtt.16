a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000

Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
he was still trying to scratch that itch.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Wall-E's was to find the beauty.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
was to prevent harm.
