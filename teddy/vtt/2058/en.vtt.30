A strong theme is always running through

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
When I was five,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that I feel a story should have,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
but is rarely invoked.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Look.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The water's stiff.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Bambi: Yippee!
