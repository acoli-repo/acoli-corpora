00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In the short-term, have you made me want to know

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
what will happen next?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But more importantly,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
have you made me want to know

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
how it will all conclude in the long-term?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Have you constructed honest conflicts

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with truth that creates doubt

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
An example would be in "Finding Nemo,"

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
in the short tension, you were always worried,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But under that was this global tension

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
of will we ever find Nemo

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in this huge, vast ocean?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
In our earliest days at Pixar,
