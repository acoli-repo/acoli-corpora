00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is it's fundamentally making a promise.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.
