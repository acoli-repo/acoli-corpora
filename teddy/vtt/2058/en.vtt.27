00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that really sort of opened my eyes

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to certain things about story.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
In 1986, I truly understood the notion

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of story having a theme.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And that was the year that they restored and re-released

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
"Lawrence of Arabia."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I saw that thing seven times in one month.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I couldn't get enough of it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I could just tell there was a grand design under it --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
in every shot, every scene, every line.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yet, on the surface it just seemed

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to be depicting his historical lineage

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of what went on.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Yet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?
