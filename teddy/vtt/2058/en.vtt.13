00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is to hide the fact

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that you're making them work for their meal.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We're born problem solvers.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We're compelled to deduce

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and to deduct,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because that's what we do in real life.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's this well-organized absence of information

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that draws us in.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's not just that they're damn cute;

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it's because they can't completely express

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
what they're thinking and what their intentions are.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And it's like a magnet.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We can't stop ourselves

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.
