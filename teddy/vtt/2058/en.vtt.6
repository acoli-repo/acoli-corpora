00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it would go something like this:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And that's what ultimately led me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to speaking to you here at TED

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
about story.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the most current story lesson that I've had

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
was completing the film I've just done

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
this year in 2012.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
with a telegram saying, "See me at once."
