Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We realized, you can make him kind,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
generous, funny, considerate,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as long as one condition is met for him,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is that he stays the top toy.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And that's what it really is,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is that we all live life conditionally.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
as long as certain conditions are met.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
After that, all bets are off.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I can now see key things that happened in my youth

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that really sort of opened my eyes

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to certain things about story.
