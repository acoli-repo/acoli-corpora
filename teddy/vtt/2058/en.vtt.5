just switching channel after channel,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's already halfway over,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000

And to make it more interesting,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we'll start from the ending

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and we'll go to the beginning.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it would go something like this:
