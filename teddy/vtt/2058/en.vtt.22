he walked in and he said,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
"You don't want me to sing, do you?"

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And I thought that epitomized perfectly

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But we really wanted to prove

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that you could tell stories completely different in animation.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We didn't have any influence then,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
so we had a little secret list of rules

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000

And they were: No songs,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
no happy village,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
no love story.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And the irony is that, in the first year,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
our story was not working at all
