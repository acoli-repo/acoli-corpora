around the ninth or 10th of June or so.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And my grandmother one time said,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
"No, look, you’re not going to run away.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is your place, you stay here."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and opened the kitchen door.
