00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ you're very ill and your heart crying. ♫

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ Wondering, wondering, wondering, wondering where is this world coming to. ♫

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ Is it right the children have to fend for themselves? No, no, no, no, no. no. ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
♫ Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head? ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
♫ So unlucky faceless people. ♫

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
♫ Thula Mama Mama, Thula Mama. Thula Mama Mama. ♫
