♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory, ♫

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
♫ piercing through the gloom of my ignorance. ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ Oh, there is a mama lying down sleeping ♫

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ you're very ill and your heart crying. ♫
