You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
as they were sort of like really told

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that they must do everything in Afrikaans --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the students wanted to speak to the government,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and police answered with bullets.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
all those comrades or students who died.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,
