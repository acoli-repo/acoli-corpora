00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and I started asking questions,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and that’s when my political education started.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I joined, later on, the youth organization

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
under the African National Congress.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So as part of organizing this and whatever,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this commemoration, the police will round us up

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as they call us leaders.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I used to run away from home,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
when I know that maybe the police might be coming

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
around the ninth or 10th of June or so.
