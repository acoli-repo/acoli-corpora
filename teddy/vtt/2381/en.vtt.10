00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.666
and in each case using what you know

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:04.193
to come up with a model that narrows down

00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:06.323
your guesses for the things that you don't know.

00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:08.588

And this is a lot of fun.

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.325
The math is not all that advanced,

00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:16.460

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.472

So what I did, I went through all of this information,

And there are some things I didn't look at.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.622
You could always look at the Google
