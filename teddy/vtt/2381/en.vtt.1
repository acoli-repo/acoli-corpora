00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.007
The ball would smash right into and through them,

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.668
and the collisions with these air molecules

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:35.333
would knock away the nitrogen,

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.291
carbon and hydrogen from the ball,

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.128
fragmenting it off into tiny particles,

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:41.612
and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:43.140
in the air around it.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.305
This would result in a flood of x-rays

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.056
that would spread out in a bubble

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.482
along with exotic particles,

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.602
plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:55.144
and that would move away from the pitcher's mound

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:57.629
slightly faster than the ball.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.311
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,
