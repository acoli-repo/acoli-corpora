00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.727
You can look at how much electricity they need,

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:04.534
because you need a certain amount
of electricity to run the servers,

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.573
and Google is more efficient than most,

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:09.670
but they still have some basic requirements,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.586
and that lets you put a limit

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:13.533
on the number of servers that they have.

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.724
You can also look at square footage and see

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.000
of the data centers that you know,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.353
how big are they?

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.275
How much room is that?

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.635
How many server racks could you fit in there?

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:25.338
And for some data centers,

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:27.327
you might get two of these pieces of information.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:29.023
You know how much they spent,

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:31.380
and they also, say, because they had to contract
