00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.842
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:01.998
So the Major League Baseball rules

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:04.102
are a little bit hazy,

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:08.987
but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:10.596
I think that in this situation,

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.049
the batter would be considered hit by pitch

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.683
and would be eligible to take first base,

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:18.886
if it still existed.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.682
So this is the kind of question I answer,

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.821
and I get people writing in with

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:24.695
a lot of other strange questions.

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.242
I've had someone write and say,

00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:29.161
scientifically speaking, what is the best

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.231
and fastest way to hide a body?
