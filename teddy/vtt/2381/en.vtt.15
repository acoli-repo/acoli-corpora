00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.013
So I go and get it, open it up,

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:32.540
and it's punch cards. (Laughter)

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.622
Google-branded punch cards.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.870
And on these punch cards,
there are a bunch of holes,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.171
and I said, thank you, thank you,

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:41.690
okay, so what's on here?

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.320
So I get some software and start reading it,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.320
and scan them, and it turns out

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.689
it's a puzzle.

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.327
There's a bunch of code,

00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.581
and I get some friends to help,

00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.133
and we crack the code, and then
inside that is another code,

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.428
and then there are some equations,

00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:54.599
and then we solve those equations,

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:58.070
and then finally out pops a message from Google

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.259
which is their official answer to my article,
