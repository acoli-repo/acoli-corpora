00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:31.380
and they also, say, because they had to contract

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.799
with the local government

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:34.479
to get the power provided,

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.136
you might know what they made a deal to buy,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:38.890
so you know how much power it takes.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.184
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:42.713
and figure out for a data center

00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:44.349
where you don't have that information,

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.441
you can figure out,

00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:47.628
but maybe you only have one of those,

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:49.307
you know the square footage,
then you could figure out

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:51.630
well, maybe the power is proportional.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.950
And you can do this same thing
with a lot of different quantities,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.026
you know, with guesses about
the total amount of storage,

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:58.619
the number of servers, the
number of drives per server,

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.666
and in each case using what you know
