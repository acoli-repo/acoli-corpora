00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.372
and then another maybe five exabytes or so

00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:05.417
of offline storage in tape drives,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.992
which it turns out Google is

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:09.502
about the world's largest consumer of.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:13.063
So I came up with this estimate, and this is

00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:14.306
a staggering amount of data.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:17.180
It's quite a bit more than any other organization

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.927
in the world has, as far as we know.

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:20.673
There's a couple of other contenders,

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:23.017
especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.

00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:24.446
But using some of these same methods,

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.469
we can look at the NSA's data centers,

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.951
and figure out, you know, we
don't know what's going on there,

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.041
but it's pretty clear that their operation
