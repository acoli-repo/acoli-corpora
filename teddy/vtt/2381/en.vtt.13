00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.041
but it's pretty clear that their operation

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.638
is not the size of Google's.

00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:34.377
Adding all of this up, I came up with

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.273
the other thing that we can answer, which is,

00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:38.258
how many punch cards would this take?

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:41.216
And so a punch card can hold

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:43.207
about 80 characters,

00:06:43.207 --> 00:06:46.980
and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.254
and you put them in, say,

00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:50.206
my home region of New England,

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:52.546
it would cover the entire region

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:56.020
up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.463
which is about three times deeper

00:06:57.463 --> 00:06:59.862
than the glaciers during the last ice age

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:02.030
about 20,000 years ago.
