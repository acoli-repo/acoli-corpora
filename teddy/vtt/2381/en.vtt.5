00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.231
and fastest way to hide a body?

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.453
Can you do this one soon?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.313
And I had someone write in,

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.328
I've had people write in about,

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:39.532
can you prove whether or not you can find love again

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:41.204
after your heart's broken?

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:42.979
And I've had people send in

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.970
what are clearly homework questions

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.113
they're trying to get me to do for them.

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:51.018
But one week, a couple months ago,

00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:54.679
I got a question that was actually about Google.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.645
If all digital data in the world
were stored on punch cards,

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.324
how big would Google's data warehouse be?
