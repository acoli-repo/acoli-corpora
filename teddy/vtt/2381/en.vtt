00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:03.391
So, I have a feature on my website where every week

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.391
people submit hypothetical questions

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:06.979
for me to answer,

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:09.360
and I try to answer them using math, science

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.820
and comics.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.228
So for example, one person asked,

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:14.922
what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.328
pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:20.280
So I did some calculations.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.547
Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.021
the air will flow around the object,

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:25.950
but in this case, the ball would be going so fast

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.401
that the air molecules wouldn't have time

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.020
to move out of the way.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.007
The ball would smash right into and through them,
