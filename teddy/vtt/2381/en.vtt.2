00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.311
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:02.214
the home plate is far enough away

00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:04.120
that light hasn't had time to reach it,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.571
which means the batter

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.335
still sees the pitcher about to throw

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.352
and has no idea that anything is wrong.

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.624
(Laughter)

00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:15.050
Now, after 70 nanoseconds,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.504
the ball will reach home plate,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.241
or at least the cloud of expanding plasma

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:21.370
that used to be the ball,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.135
and it will engulf the bat and the batter

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.596
and the plate and the catcher and the umpire

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.401
and start disintegrating them all
