00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:02.030
about 20,000 years ago.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.453
So this is impractical, but I think

00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:07.404
that's about the best answer I could come up with.

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.542
And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:13.232
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.863
because of course they've been so secretive,

00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:16.267
they didn't answer of my questions,

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:17.774
and so I just put it up and said,

00:07:17.774 --> 00:07:19.297
well, I guess we'll never know.

00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:21.321
But then a little while later

00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.770
I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.212
saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.013
So I go and get it, open it up,
