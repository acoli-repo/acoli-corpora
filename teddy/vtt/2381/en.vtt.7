00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:32.403
on how many data centers could they be building,

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:34.703
because a big data center costs
a certain amount of money.

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:37.135
And you can also then put a cap on

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:39.466
how much of the world hard
drive market are they taking up,

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.418
which turns out, it's pretty sizable.

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:43.355
I read a calculation at one point,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.820
I think Google has a drive failure

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.074
about every minute or two,

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:49.424
and they just throw out the hard drive

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:50.810
and swap in a new one.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.010
So they go through a huge number of them.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.121
And so by looking at money,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.970
you can get an idea of how
many of these centers they have.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.830
You can also look at power.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.727
You can look at how much electricity they need,
