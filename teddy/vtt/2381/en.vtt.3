00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.401
and start disintegrating them all

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.567
as it also starts to carry them backward

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:38.031
through the backstop, which
also starts to disintegrate.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.801
So if you were watching this whole thing

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.108
from a hill,

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:44.481
ideally, far away,

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:45.936
what you'd see is a bright flash of light

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:47.442
that would fade over a few seconds,

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:49.570
followed by a blast wave spreading out,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.030
shredding trees and houses

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.149
as it moves away from the stadium,

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.081
and then eventually a mushroom cloud

00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.842
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)
