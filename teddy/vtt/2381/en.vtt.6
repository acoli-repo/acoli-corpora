00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.324
how big would Google's data warehouse be?

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:03.046
Now, Google's pretty secretive
about their operations,

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:06.422
so no one really knows how much data Google has,

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.937
and in fact, no one really knows
how many data centers Google has,

00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:11.428
except people at Google itself.

00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:12.662
And I've tried, I've met them a few times,

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:17.885
tried asking them, and they
aren't revealing anything.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.420
So I decided to try to figure this out myself.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.579
There are a few things that I looked at here.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.485
I started with money.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.627
Google has to reveal how much they spend,

00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:28.617
in general, and that lets you put some caps

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:32.403
on how many data centers could they be building,
