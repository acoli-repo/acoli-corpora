00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now that can be daunting.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You want me to go to church and call my mother."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I understand.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I truly understand how that can be daunting.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
gave me a new perspective.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
called me up at the office

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Harry -- "up from school."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So I left work an hour early that afternoon
