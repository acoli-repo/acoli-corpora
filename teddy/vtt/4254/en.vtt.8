00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
even the good, well-intentioned companies.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
On the one hand,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
putting childcare facilities in the workplace

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
is wonderful and enlightened.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We have to be responsible

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
for setting and enforcing

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the boundaries that we want in our life.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The third observation is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we have to be careful

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with the time frame that we choose

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
upon which to judge our balance.
