00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but we need to elongate it

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
without falling into the trap

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
when my kids have left home,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I've got no mates or interests left."

A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
A fourth observation:

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We need to approach balance

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in a balanced way.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A friend came to see me last year --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year
