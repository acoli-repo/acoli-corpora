00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So I left work an hour early that afternoon

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and picked Harry up at the school gates.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We walked down to the local park,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and we shared a pizza for two,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
then walked down the hill to our home,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and I gave him his bath

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and put him in his Batman pajamas.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I then read him a chapter

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,
