00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and walked out of his bedroom.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
As I was walking out of his bedroom,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of my life, ever."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I hadn't done anything,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Now my point is

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the small things matter.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Being more balanced

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.
