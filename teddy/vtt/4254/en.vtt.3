00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I have four observations

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'd like to share with you today.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The first is:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
if society's to make any progress on this issue,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we need an honest debate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But the trouble is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so many people talk so much rubbish

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
about work-life balance.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
All the discussions about flexi-time

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or dress-down Fridays

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or paternity leave

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
only serve to mask the core issue,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that certain job and career choices
