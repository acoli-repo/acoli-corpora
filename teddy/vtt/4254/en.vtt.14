00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now I don't mean to mock,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Lovely though physical exercise may be,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
there are other parts to life --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
there's the spiritual side.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And to be balanced,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I believe we have to attend

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to all of those areas --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
not just do 50 stomach crunches.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now that can be daunting.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.
