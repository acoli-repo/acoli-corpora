00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was working too hard

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I was neglecting the family.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I decided that I would try

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and turn my life around.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In particular, I decided

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I would try to address the thorny issue

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of work-life balance.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I stepped back from the workforce,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and I spent a year at home

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with my wife and four young children.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But all I learned about work-life balance

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from that year
