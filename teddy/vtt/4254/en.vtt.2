00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But all I learned about work-life balance

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from that year

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was that I found it quite easy

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to balance work and life

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
when I didn't have any work.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Not a very useful skill,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
especially when the money runs out.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I went back to work,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I've spent these seven years since

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
struggling with, studying

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and writing about work-life balance.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I have four observations

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'd like to share with you today.
