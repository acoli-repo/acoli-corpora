that you never put the quality of your life

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in the hands of a commercial corporation.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Laughter)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm talking about all companies.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Because commercial companies

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are inherently designed

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to get as much out of you [as]

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
they can get away with.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it's what they do --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
even the good, well-intentioned companies.
