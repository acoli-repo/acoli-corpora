00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
where they work long, hard hours

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at jobs they hate

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to enable them to buy things they don't need

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to impress people they don't like.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Applause)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The second observation I'd like to make

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is we need to face the truth

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that governments and corporations

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
aren't going to solve this issue for us.
