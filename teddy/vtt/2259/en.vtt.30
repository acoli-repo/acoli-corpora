00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:04.667
Fred could not answer
any of those questions.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:08.828
I said, "Fred, this story
is not about Mabel.

00:15:08.852 --> 00:15:10.241
This story is about you."

00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:13.850
I said, "This story made you feel good,

00:15:13.874 --> 00:15:16.033
but this story is not about Mabel.

00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.651
The reality is,

00:15:17.675 --> 00:15:20.229
what probably happened was,
Mabel was crying,

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.329
which was not something
she customarily did,

00:15:22.353 --> 00:15:24.118
so she was letting her guard down.

00:15:24.637 --> 00:15:26.269
And you came into the kitchen,

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:29.790
and you caught her at a weak moment
where she was letting her guard down.
