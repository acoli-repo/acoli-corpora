00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.507
and I was proud of him
to see this excitement.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.183
But then I still had a problem.

00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:07.762
Because I still had to go his school

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:09.793
and address the issue with his teacher,

00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:13.116
because I didn't want her
to continue to teach the kids

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.512
obviously false history.

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.316
So I'm agonizing over this,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.800
primarily because I understand,
as an African-American man,

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.168
that whenever you talk
to whites about racism

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:25.197
or anything that's racially sensitive,

00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.179
there's usually going to be a challenge.

00:05:27.203 --> 00:05:33.263
This is what white sociologist
Robin DiAngelo calls "white fragility."
