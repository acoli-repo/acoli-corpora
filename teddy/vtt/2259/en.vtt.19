Other civil rights leaders' houses
were bombed in Birmingham.

00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:36.855
Rosa Parks's husband
slept at night with a shotgun,

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:39.146
because they would get
constant death threats.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.676
In fact, Rosa Parks's mother
lived with them,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.176
and sometimes she would stay
on the phone for hours

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.360
so that nobody would call in
with death threats,

00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:49.609
because it was constant and persistent.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.260
In fact, there was so much tension,

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:54.941
there was so much pressure,
there was so much terrorism,

00:09:54.965 --> 00:09:57.492
that Rosa Parks and her husband,
they lost their jobs,

00:09:57.516 --> 00:09:59.330
and they became unemployable

00:09:59.354 --> 00:10:03.456
and eventually had to leave
and move out of the South.
