And in fact, Rosa Parks,
when she was sitting on that bus that day,

00:04:34.137 --> 00:04:36.775
waiting for those
police officers to arrive

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:39.746
and not knowing what was going
to happen to her,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.927
she was not thinking about
Martin Luther King,

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.407
who she barely knew.

00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:46.271
She was not thinking about
nonviolence or Gandhi.

00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:48.226
She was thinking about her grandfather,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.276
a gun-toting, take-no-mess grandfather.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.838
That's who Rosa Parks was thinking about.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:59.536
My son was mesmerized by Rosa Parks,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.507
and I was proud of him
to see this excitement.
