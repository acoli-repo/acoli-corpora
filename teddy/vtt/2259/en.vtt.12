but I was like, this is a necessary evil

of being a black parent trying to raise
self-actualized black children.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.947
So I called Elijah to me and said,

00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:12.744
"Elijah, I'm going to set up
an appointment with your teacher

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:13.976
and try and correct this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.237
and maybe your principal.

00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:16.662
What do you think?"

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:17.837
And Elijah said,

00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:19.997
"Dad, I have a better idea."

00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.974
And I said, "Really? What's your idea?"

00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:27.628
He said, "We have
a public speaking assignment,

00:06:27.652 --> 00:06:30.217
and why don't I use
that public speaking assignment
