He was a civil rights activist.

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:05.308
He would organize events

00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:10.271
and sometimes the events would be
at Rosa Parks's home.

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:12.315
And one time Rosa Parks remarked

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.654
that there were so many guns on the table,

00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:17.946
because they were prepared for somebody
to come busting into the door

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.733
that they were prepared
for whatever was going to go down,

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:23.587
that Rosa Parks said, "There were
so many guns on the table

00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:26.340
that I forgot to even
offer them coffee or food."

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:29.403
This is who Rosa Parks was.

00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:34.113
And in fact, Rosa Parks,
when she was sitting on that bus that day,
