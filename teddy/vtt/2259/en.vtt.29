00:14:27.304 --> 00:14:30.222
what do you think the eight-year-old
African-American children

00:14:30.246 --> 00:14:31.397
were calling her?

00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.668
Do you think they called her
by her first name?"

00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:35.272
No, they called her "Miss Mabel,"

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:38.700
or they called her "Miss Johnson,"
or they called her "Auntie Johnson."

00:14:38.724 --> 00:14:41.311
They would have never dared
call her by her first name,

00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:43.867
because that would have been
the height of disrespect.

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.125
And yet, you were calling
her by her first name

00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:47.733
every single day that she worked,

00:14:47.757 --> 00:14:49.685
and you never thought about it."

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:52.718
I said, "Let me ask you another question:
Was Mabel married?

00:14:53.255 --> 00:14:54.729
Did she have children?

00:14:54.753 --> 00:14:56.421
What church did she go to?

00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:58.675
What was her favorite dessert?"
