00:06:27.652 --> 00:06:30.217
and why don't I use
that public speaking assignment

00:06:30.241 --> 00:06:33.804
to talk about debunking
the myths of Rosa Parks?"

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:35.913
And I was like,

00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:38.262
"Well, that is a good idea."

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.083
So Elijah goes to school,

00:06:43.107 --> 00:06:44.886
he does his presentation,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.404
he comes back home,

00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:48.801
and I could see something
positive happened.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.736
I said, "Well, what happened, son?"

00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.411
He said, "Well, later on in that day,

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:55.379
the teacher pulled me aside,

00:06:55.403 --> 00:06:59.999
and she apologized to me
for giving that misinformation."
