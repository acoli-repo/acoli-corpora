she had only worked six hours that day,
and she was a seamstress

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:11.746
and her feet were just fine.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.901

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.353
This is confusing for me."

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:30.779
Because he loved his teacher,
and she was a good teacher,
