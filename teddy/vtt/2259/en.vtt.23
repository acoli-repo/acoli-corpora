I said, "Fred, I've got a real problem
with this moment that you talk

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.968
about your maid in your book."

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:47.685
And I could see Fred get a little
"tight," as we say.

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:51.472
He said, "What do you mean?
That's a great story.

00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:53.347
It happened just like I said."

00:11:53.371 --> 00:11:56.281
I said, "Mmm ... can I give you
another scenario?"

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.279
Now, what's the story?

00:11:58.303 --> 00:11:59.920
It was 1968.
