00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:30.779
Because he loved his teacher,
and she was a good teacher,

00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:33.746
a young-ish, 20-something white woman,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.481
really, really smart, pushed him,
so I liked her as well.

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:40.498
But he was confused.
"Why would she tell me this?" he said.

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:44.033
He said, "Dad, tell me more. Tell me more.
Tell me more about Rosa Parks."

00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:46.310
And I said, "Son, I'll do you one better."

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:48.037
He was like, "What?"

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.121
I said, "I'm going to buy
her autobiography,

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:52.183
and I'm going to let you
read it yourself."

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:54.899
(Laughter)

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:57.434
So as you can imagine,

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:03.090
Elijah wasn't too excited about
this new, lengthy homework assignment
