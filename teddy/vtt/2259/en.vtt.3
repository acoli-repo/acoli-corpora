00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:30.704
... um ...

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:32.084
history lesson.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:36.788
And so he stopped, and he was like,
"Dad, what's wrong? What did I get wrong?"

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.901
I said, "Son, you didn't
get anything wrong,

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:41.685
but I think your teacher
got a whole lot of things wrong."

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:42.719
(Laughter)

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:44.415
He said, "Well, what do you mean?"

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.679
I said, "Rosa Parks was not tired.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.329
She was not old.

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:54.409
And she certainly didn't have tired feet."

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.597
He said, "What?"

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.779
I said, "Yes!

00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:58.998
Rosa Parks was only 42 years old" --
