00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One out of two of you women

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
will be impacted by cardiovascular disease

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in your lifetime.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So this is the leading killer of women.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's a closely held secret

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for reasons I don't know.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In addition to making this personal --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and all women's relationship with their heart --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we're going to wax into the politics.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because the personal, as you know, is political.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And not enough is being done about this.
