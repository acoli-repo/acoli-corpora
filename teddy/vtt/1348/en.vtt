Now, I want to start with a question:

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:05.706
When was the last time
you were called "childish"?

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.976
For kids like me,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.356
being called childish
can be a frequent occurrence.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.976
Every time we make irrational demands,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.976
exhibit irresponsible behavior,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.976
or display any other signs
of being normal American citizens,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.392
we are called childish.

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:22.976
Which really bothers me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
After all, take a look at these events:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
Imperialism and colonization,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
world wars, George W. Bush.
