00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:03.541
On February 24,

00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.044
my daughter spoke for the first time.

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:10.089
First word was “ba-bah,”

00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:12.925
which means the sound
of a great explosion.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:17.513
That night, we woke
to the concussive sound of bombs

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.766
as our windows came crashing in.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.518
It was the bombardment of Kyiv.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.105
I'm someone who didn't believe
it would happen.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:30.610
I was born just a few days
before the Chernobyl disaster
