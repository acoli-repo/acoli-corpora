What story do you take away
from Tyler Cowen?

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.686
One story you might be
like the story of the quest.

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:07.111
"Tyler was a man on a quest.

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:12.703
Tyler came here, and he told us
not to think so much in terms of stories."

00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:15.908
That would be a story
you could tell about this talk.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.805
(Laughter)

00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.787
It would fit a pretty well-known pattern.

00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:22.676
You might remember it.
You could tell it to other people.

00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:24.396
"This weird guy came, and he said,

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:27.796
'Don't think in terms of stories.
Let me tell you what happened today!'"

00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:28.799
(Laughter)

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.330
And you tell your story.
