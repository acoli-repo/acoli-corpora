Be more comfortable with agnostic,

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.871
and I mean this about the things
that make you feel good.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.644
It's so easy to pick out
a few areas to be agnostic in,

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:38.997
and then feel good about it,

00:14:38.997 --> 00:14:42.828
like, "I am agnostic
about religion, or politics."

00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:47.040
It's a kind of portfolio move you make
to be more dogmatic elsewhere, right?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.220
(Laughter)

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.290
Sometimes,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.836
the most intellectually trustworthy people
are the ones who pick one area,

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:57.028
and they are totally dogmatic in that,
so pig-headedly unreasonable,

00:14:57.028 --> 00:14:59.678
that you think,
"How can they possibly believe that?"

00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:04.170
But it soaks up their stubbornness,
