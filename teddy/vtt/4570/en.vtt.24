You also could tell
a story of deep tragedy.

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:05.021
"This guy Tyler Cowen came

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:06.271
(Laughter)

00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:08.873
and he told us not to think
in terms of stories,

00:12:08.873 --> 00:12:10.811
but all he could do was tell us stories

00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:11.877
(Laughter)

00:12:11.877 --> 00:12:15.838
about how other people think
too much in terms of stories."

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:17.797
(Laughter)

00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:23.073
So, today, which is it?
Is it like quest, rebirth, tragedy?

00:12:23.523 --> 00:12:26.016
Or maybe some combination of the three?

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:29.404
I'm really not sure,
and I'm not here to tell you

00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:33.359
to burn your DVD player
and throw out your Tolstoy.
