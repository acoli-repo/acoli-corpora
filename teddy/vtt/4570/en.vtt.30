But it soaks up their stubbornness,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.900
and then, on other things,
they can be pretty open-minded.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.079
So don't fall into the trap of thinking
because you're agnostic on some things,

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:13.092
that you're being fundamentally reasonable

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:16.192
about your self-deception, your stories,
and your open-mindedness.

00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:18.339
(Laughter)

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:22.756
[Think about] this idea of hovering,
of epistemological hovering,

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:26.413
and messiness, and incompleteness,

00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:29.049
[and how] not everything 
ties up into a neat bow,

00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:31.879
and you're really not on a journey here.
