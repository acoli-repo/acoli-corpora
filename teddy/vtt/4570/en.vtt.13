It's a kind of self-deception,

00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:33.575
but the problem comes
when I need to change that story.

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:37.796
The whole point of the story is
that I grab onto it and I hold it,

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.630
and it gets me out of bed.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.143
So when I'm really doing something
that is actually just a waste of time,

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:44.958
in my mess of a life,

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:49.369
I'm too tied into my story
that got me out of bed,

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:53.107
and ideally, I ought to have some
very complex story map in my mind,

00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:56.962
you know, with combinatorials
and a matrix of computation, and the like,

00:06:56.962 --> 00:06:58.868
but that is not how stories work.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:00.927
Stories in order to work 
have to be simple,
