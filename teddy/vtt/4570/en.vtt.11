But this is again a story we fall back
upon all too readily, all too quickly.

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:34.478
When we don't really know
why something happened,

00:05:34.478 --> 00:05:38.187
we blame someone, and we say:
"We need to get tough with them!"

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:40.771
As if it had never occurred
to your predecessor,

00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:42.989

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.095
I view it usually

"We need to get tough,

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:52.078
we needed to get tough,
we will have to get tough."

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:54.973
Usually, that is a kind of warning signal.

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:58.784
Another kind of problem with stories is

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.206
you can only fit so many stories
into your mind at once,
