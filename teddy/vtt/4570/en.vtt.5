00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.039
So they are like a candy that we're fed

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.516
when we consume political information,
when we read novels.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.912
When we read non-fiction books,
we're really being fed stories.

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:39.295
Non-fiction is, in a sense,
the new fiction.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.120
The book may happen to say true things,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.550
but again, everything's taking
the same form of these stories.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.449
So what are the problems
of relying too heavily on stories?

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.346
You view your life like this

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:55.696
instead of the mess
that it is or it ought to be.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:59.763
But more specifically,
I think of a few major problems

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.801
when we think too much
in terms of narrative.
