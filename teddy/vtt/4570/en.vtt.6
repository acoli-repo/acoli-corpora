00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.801
when we think too much
in terms of narrative.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.455
First, narratives tend to be too simple,

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.896
for the point of a narrative
is to strip it away,

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.502
not just into 18 minutes,

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:12.954
but most narratives 
you can present in a sentence or two.

00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:14.815
When you strip away detail,

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:18.443
you tend to tell stories
in terms of good versus evil,

00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:22.044
whether it's a story about your own life
or a story about politics.

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:26.458
I know some things actually are
good versus evil, we all know this, right?

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:27.965
But I think, as a general rule,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.039
we're too inclined to tell
the good versus evil story.
