They're the ones who go out
and make the worst mistakes.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.043
It's the people who realize
they don't know anything at all,

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.052

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:25.008
what will happen is people
selling products come along,

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.386
and they will bundle
their product with a story.

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:29.033
You're like, "Hey, a free story!"

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:30.678
And you end up buying the product,
