00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.656
But the thing about this filter is
that it always leaves the same things in.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.777
You're always left
with the same few simple stories.

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:37.173
There is the old saying
that just about every story

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:40.614
can be summed up
as "a stranger came to town."

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:42.466
There is a book by Christopher Booker,

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.360
where he claims there are really
just seven types of stories.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
There is monster, rags to riches, quest,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.019
voyage and return,
comedy, tragedy, rebirth.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.234
You don't have to agree
with that list exactly,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:57.564
but the point is this:
if you think in terms of stories,

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:01.776
you're telling yourself the same things
over and over again.
