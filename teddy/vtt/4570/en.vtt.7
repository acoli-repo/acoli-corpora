00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.039
we're too inclined to tell
the good versus evil story.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.289
As a simple rule of thumb,

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.539
just imagine that every time
you're telling a good versus evil story,

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:41.715
you're basically lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:45.052
If you just adopt that
as a kind of inner mental habit,

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:48.354
it's, in my view, one way to get
a lot smarter pretty quickly.

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:49.973
You don't have to read any books.

00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:52.028
Just imagine yourself pressing a button

00:03:52.028 --> 00:03:54.646
every time you tell
the good versus evil story,

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.223
and by pressing that button,

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.793
you're lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.
