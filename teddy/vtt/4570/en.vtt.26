But again, as an economist,
I'm thinking about life on the margin,

00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:02.954
the extra decision.

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:07.063
Should we think more in terms of stories,
or less in terms of stories?

00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:11.195
When we hear stories,
should we be more suspicious?

00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:13.963
And what kind of stories
should we be suspicious of?

00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:18.587
Again, I'm telling you it's the stories,
very often, that you like the most,

00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:22.447
that you find the most rewarding,
the most inspiring.

00:13:22.447 --> 00:13:26.148
The stories that don't focus
on opportunity cost,

00:13:26.148 --> 00:13:29.969
or the complex, unintended
consequences of human action,

00:13:29.969 --> 00:13:33.863
because that very often
does not make for a good story.
