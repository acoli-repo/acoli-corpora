Another common story or storyline is
the claim that we "have to get tough".

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:07.534
You'll hear this in so many contexts.

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:12.801
We have to get tough with the banks.
We had to get tough with the labor unions.

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:14.937
We need to get tough
with some other country,

00:05:14.937 --> 00:05:18.756
some foreign dictator,
someone we're negotiating with.

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:21.105
Again, the point is not
against getting tough.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:22.865
Sometimes we should get tough.

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:26.087
That we got tough with the Nazis
was a good thing.

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:32.181
But this is again a story we fall back
upon all too readily, all too quickly.
