00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.501
Pull back and say:

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:32.599
"What are the messages,

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.383
what are the stories
that no one has an incentive to tell?"

00:10:35.383 --> 00:10:39.970
Start telling yourself those, and then see
if any of your decisions change.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.646
That is one simple way.

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:45.107
You can never get out of the pattern
of thinking in terms of stories,

00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:48.743
but you can improve the extent
to which you think in stories,

00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:50.807
and make some better decisions.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:54.671
So if I'm thinking about this talk,
I'm wondering, of course,

00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:57.298
what is it you take away from this talk?

00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:01.077
What story do you take away
from Tyler Cowen?
