00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:01.776
you're telling yourself the same things
over and over again.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:04.796
There was a study done,
we asked some people--

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:13.933
people were asked to describe their lives.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.614
When asked to describe their lives,

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.861
what is interesting
is how few people said "mess".

00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.313
(Laughter)

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:24.355
It's probably the best answer,
I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.768
"Mess" can be liberating,
"mess" can be empowering,

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:30.416
"mess" can be a way
of drawing upon multiple strengths.
