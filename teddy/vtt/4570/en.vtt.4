00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:01.349
and the thing is when something
is in the form of a story,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.853
often, we remember it when we shouldn't.

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:05.426
So how many of you know the story

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:08.197
about George Washington
and the cherry tree?

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.467
It's not obvious that is
exactly what happened.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:15.405
The story of Paul Revere, it's not obvious
that that is exactly the way it happened.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:19.135
So again, we should be
suspicious of stories.

00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:22.468
We're biologically programmed
to respond to them.

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:25.410
They contain a lot of information.
They have social power.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.314
They connect us to other people.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.039
So they are like a candy that we're fed
