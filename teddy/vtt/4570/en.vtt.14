Stories in order to work 
have to be simple,

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:04.637
easily grasped, easily told
to others, easily remembered.

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.747
So stories will serve dual
and conflicting purposes,

00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:10.636
and very often they will lead us astray.

00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:13.477
I used to think I was
within the camp of economists,

00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:17.537
I was one of the good guys,
and I was allied with other good guys,

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.666
and we were fighting
the ideas of the bad guys.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:22.278
I used to think that!

00:07:22.828 --> 00:07:24.944
And probably, I was wrong.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.952
Maybe sometimes, I'm one of the good guys,

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:31.283
but on some issues, I finally realized:
"Hey, I wasn't one of the good guys."
