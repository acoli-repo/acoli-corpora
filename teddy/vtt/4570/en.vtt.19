And you end up buying the product,

00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:32.868
because the product
and the story go together.

00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:33.906

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.845
If you think about how capitalism works,

00:09:35.845 --> 00:09:37.198
there is a bias here.

00:09:37.198 --> 00:09:39.932
Let's consider two kinds
of stories about cars.

00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:43.380
Story A is: "Buy this car,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.998
and you will have beautiful, romantic
partners and a fascinating life."

00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:48.508
(Laughter)

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:50.628
There are a lot of people

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:53.123
who have a financial incentive
to promote that story.

00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:55.221
But, say, the alternative story is:

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:59.661
"You don't actually need a car
as nice as your income would indicate.

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:03.102
What you usually do is look
at what your peers do and copy them.
