00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.473
So when you hear stories about plots,

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:33.493
or even stories about good people
plotting things together,

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.617
just like when you're watching movies,

00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.356
this, again, is reason to be suspicious.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:40.367
As a good rule of thumb, if you're asking:

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.736
"When I hear a story, when should I
be especially suspicious?"

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:48.692
If you hear a story and you think:
"Wow, that would make a great movie!"

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:49.774
(Laughter)

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:53.632
That's when the "uh-oh" reaction
should pop in a bit more,

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:55.566
and you should start thinking in terms

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:58.425
of how the whole thing
is maybe a bit of a mess.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:04.483
Another common story or storyline is
the claim that we "have to get tough".
