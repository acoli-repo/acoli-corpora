00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.444
I was told to come here
and tell you all stories,

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:07.657
but what I'd like to do is instead
tell you why I'm suspicious of stories,

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.006
why stories make me nervous.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.125
In fact, the more inspired
a story makes me feel,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.385
very often, the more nervous I get.

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:16.515
(Laughter)

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.305
So the best stories
are often the trickiest ones.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.695
The good and bad things about stories
is that they are a kind of filter.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.606
They take a lot of information,
and they leave some of it out,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.350
and they keep some of it in.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.656
But the thing about this filter is
that it always leaves the same things in.
