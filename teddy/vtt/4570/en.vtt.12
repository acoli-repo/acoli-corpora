00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.206
you can only fit so many stories
into your mind at once,

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:05.268
or in the course of a day,
or even over the course of a lifetime.

00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:08.134
So your stories are serving
too many purposes.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.027
For instance, just to get
out of bed in the morning,

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:13.110
you tell yourself the story

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.620
that your job is really important,
what you're doing is really important

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.456
(Laughter)

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:23.994
and maybe it is, but I tell myself
that story even when it's not.

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.956
And you know what? That story works.

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.610
It gets me out of bed.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.968
It's a kind of self-deception,
