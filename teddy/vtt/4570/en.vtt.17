00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:31.376
Often, people buy them
as a kind of talisman, like:

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:35.243
"I bought this book. I won't be
'Predictably Irrational'."

00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:37.903
(Laughter)

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:39.835
It's like people want to hear the worst,

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:43.576
so psychologically, they can prepare
for it or defend against it.

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:46.714
It's why there is
such a market for pessimism.

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:49.617
But to think that by buying the book
gets you somewhere,

00:08:49.617 --> 00:08:51.535
that's maybe the bigger fallacy.

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:54.797
It's just like the evidence that shows
that the most dangerous people

00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:57.556
are those who have been taught
some financial literacy.

00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:00.179
They're the ones who go out
and make the worst mistakes.
