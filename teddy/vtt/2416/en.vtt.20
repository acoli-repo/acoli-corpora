to pay for me to continue my education.

00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:05.483
Well, with this system,

00:10:05.507 --> 00:10:07.729
we are not just providing pots,

00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:11.404
or making a single meal
out of the pumpkins.

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:12.958
After all,

00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:15.934
there are hundreds
of seeds in a single pumpkin.

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.887
We are saving the seeds,

00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:19.076
planting them

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.167

00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:23.879
And the result?

00:10:24.482 --> 00:10:28.546
A virtuous cycle of prosperity,

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.863
equality and hope,
