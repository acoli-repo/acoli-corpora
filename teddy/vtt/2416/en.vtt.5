00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.895
This is Stumai from rural Tanzania.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.768
She tragically lost her father
when she was just three years old.

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:40.844
Leaving a disabled mother
to single-handedly raise her

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:42.505
and her five siblings.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.474
Once Stumai completed primary school,

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.426
she was about to drop out of school

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.728
and become one of the 92 percent
of girls in sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:53.656
that never finish high school.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.585
Instead, she got lucky.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.918
She got support from a nonprofit
that paid her fees

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:00.641
and kept her in school.
