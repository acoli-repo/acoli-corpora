00:04:54.191 --> 00:05:00.096
Stumai says her greatest reward
is witnessing the girls she mentors

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.040
start to believe in themselves
and succeeding.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.664
These days, Stumai also trains
other learner guides.

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:11.069
That's multiplying the number of girls
making it through school

00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:13.902
and into secure livelihoods like she did.

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:18.268
Through her business profits,
she has been able to support her siblings,

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:21.633
three nieces and nephews
and other children in her community

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:22.855
to go to school.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.141
She also regularly supports
other network members.

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:27.498
For example,

00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:31.339
a young woman studying for a diploma
in community development.
