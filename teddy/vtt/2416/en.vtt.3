00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:32.145
I'm one of the leaders
of the organization behind this movement.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:36.248
An organization that also
supported me through school.

00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:42.283
And I have seen social interest
multiply the impact of our work.

00:01:43.363 --> 00:01:48.116
Social interest is a way
to pay back interest on a loan

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.648
through service, rather than dollars.

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:53.235
Sharing time and knowledge
through mentoring,

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.918
academic support,

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:57.366
business training to others in need.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.311
This means the impact of a loan
is felt not by one, but by many.
