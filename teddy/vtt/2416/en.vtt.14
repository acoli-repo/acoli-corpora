00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:00.168
The girls we work with
are nearly three times less likely

00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:01.525
to drop out of school,

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:05.328
because learner guides make home visits
when girls fail to attend school

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.065
to help them back on track.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.698
They also work with communities
and district governments

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.794
to address the challenges children face,

00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:17.532
including preventing
or annulling child marriages,

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:21.020
connecting children facing hunger
or hardship at home

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:22.472
with local support,

00:07:22.496 --> 00:07:23.726
or running study groups

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.361
so that children who might be
lagging behind in their studies

00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:29.369
can get supporters and catch up.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.520
They act as trusted sisters,
friends and guardians.
