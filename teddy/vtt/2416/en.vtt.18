WEBVTT

00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:02.889
pass on the skills they learned
in training colleges?

00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:05.188
Like Michelle,

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.815
who teaches brickmaking
in rural Zimbabwe.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.323
Or Louisa,

00:09:09.347 --> 00:09:12.426
who is training others
on climate-smart agriculture

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.730
in Malawi.

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:15.420
Or Fatima in Ghana,

00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:18.246
who is training women
to help deliver babies

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.040
where expectant mothers

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.407
might not be able to make it
to the local hospital on time.

00:09:24.338 --> 00:09:25.839
When I was growing up,

00:09:25.863 --> 00:09:28.974
an elder in my village in rural Zimbabwe

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:32.394
once described the challenges I faced
in going to school.
