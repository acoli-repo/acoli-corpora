00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:38.558
"Those who harvest many pumpkins

00:09:38.582 --> 00:09:42.388
often do not have the clay pots
to cook them in."

00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:44.458
(Laughter)

00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:46.657
What she meant was that,

00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:53.269
although I got the best possible
results in my exams

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.545
when I finished elementary school,

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:58.037
my talent was of no value

00:09:58.061 --> 00:10:03.054
if my family could not afford
to pay for me to continue my education.
