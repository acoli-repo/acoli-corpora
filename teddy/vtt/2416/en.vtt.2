00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:03.716
But I'm not here
to narrate the doom and gloom,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.553
because we also know
that a youthful population

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:10.268
presents an opportunity
to kick-start economic growth

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:12.307
and solve global challenges.

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.482
And in fact,

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:18.855
there is a growing movement in Africa,
of educated young women,

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.765
who are stepping up and using
the power of their network

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.440
and a tool we call social interest

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:27.122
to uplift communities.

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:32.145
I'm one of the leaders
of the organization behind this movement.
