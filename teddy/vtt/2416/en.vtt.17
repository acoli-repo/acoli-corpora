00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.593
succeed, lead and in turn,
support thousands more.

00:08:34.408 --> 00:08:35.571
This system,

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:39.376
supporting those once excluded
to transform their lives

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.265
and then step up for others,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.956
can work for more than girls' education.

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:48.104
Of course, you need to get
your money back if you lend it.

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:52.341
But instead of demanding
interest in dollars,

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.076
can you consider using
social interest instead?

00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:57.739
For example,

00:08:57.763 --> 00:08:59.588
could young people

00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:02.889
pass on the skills they learned
in training colleges?
