00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.396
I'd like to talk to you today
about the scale of the scientific effort

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.100
that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper.

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.473
Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change;

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:13.343
and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.307
They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science.

00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.263
Recently, the headlines looked like this

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:21.129
when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC,

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.304
put out their report

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:24.965
on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.970
That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.495
They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic,
