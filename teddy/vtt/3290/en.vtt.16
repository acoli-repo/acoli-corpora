00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.696
One beat, say, for every time
a planet goes around.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.456
But now we know if you speed
that motion up even more,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.816
you'll actually produce musical pitches,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.360
and in this case alone,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.776
those pitches will work together,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.560
making harmonious,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.920
So let's hear TRAPPIST-1.

and just keep in mind,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.256
this music is coming
from the system itself.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.336
I'm not creating the pitches or rhythms,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.376
I'm just bringing them
into the human hearing range.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.376
And after all seven planets have entered,
