00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.736
(Music ends)

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.816
(Applause)

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.056
Thank you.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.056
(Applause)

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.280
But there's more.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.000
(Laughter)

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.736
So the two features of music
we like to think of as pitch and rhythms,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.256
they're actually two versions
of the same thing,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.496
and I can show you.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.736
(Slow rhythm)

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.960
That's a rhythm right?

00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:59.336
Watch what happens when we speed it up.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.576
(Rhythm gets gradually faster)
