00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.776
But there's something even more
exciting about this system,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.000
especially for me.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.096
And that's that TRAPPIST-1
is a resonant chain.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.920
And so that means for every two orbits
of the outer planet,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.256
the next one in orbits three times,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.056
and the next one in four,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.336
and then six, nine, 15 and 24.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.880
So you see a lot of very simple ratios
among the orbits of these planets.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.976
Clearly, if you speed up their motion,
you can get rhythms, right?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.696
One beat, say, for every time
a planet goes around.
