You got some liquid water,
some ice, maybe some land,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.640
maybe you can go for a dive
in this amazing orange sunset.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.256
It got everyone excited,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.736
and then a few months later,
some other papers came out

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.480
that said, actually,
it probably looks more like this.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.280
(Laughter)

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.296
So there were signs

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.016
that some of the surfaces
might actually be molten lava

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.536
and that there were very damaging
X-rays coming from the central star --

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.840
X-rays that will sterilize the surface
of life and even strip off atmospheres.
