00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.976
So for one thing,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.176
our solar system
is on a much, much larger scale,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.896
and so to hear all eight planets,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.096
we have to start with Neptune
near the bottom of our hearing range,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.256
and then Mercury's going
to be all the way up

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.176
near the very top of our hearing range.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.776
But also, since our planets
are not very compact --

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.136
they're very spread out --

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.736
they didn't have to adjust
their orbits to each other,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.376
so they're kind of just all playing
their own random note at random times.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.120
So, I'm sorry, but here it is.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.136
(Tone)

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.576
That's Neptune.
