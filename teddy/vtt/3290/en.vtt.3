00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.656
they're usually pretty impressed.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.896
And then I say I'm also a musician --
they're like, "Yeah, we know."

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.936
(Laughter)

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.256
So everyone seems to know

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.216
that there's this deep connection
between music and astronomy.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.896
And it's actually a very old idea;

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.936
it goes back over 2,000 years
to Pythagoras.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.216
You might remember Pythagoras
from such theorems

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.096
as the Pythagorean theorem --

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.136
(Laughter)

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.720
And he said:

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.176
"There is geometry
in the humming of the strings,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.696
there is music in the spacing
of the spheres."

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.056
And so he literally thought

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.816
that the motions of the planets
along the celestial sphere
