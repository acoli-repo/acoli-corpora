It may sound like a silly question,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.896
but have you ever wondered why it is

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.176
that certain notes, when played together,
sound relatively pleasing or consonant,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.416
such as these two --

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.016
(Music)

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.696
while others are
a lot more tense or dissonant,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.976
such as these two.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.336
(Music)

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.576
Right?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.536
Why is that? Why are there notes at all?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.160
Why can you be in or out of tune?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.496
Well, the answer to that question

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.040
was actually solved by Pythagoras himself.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.760
