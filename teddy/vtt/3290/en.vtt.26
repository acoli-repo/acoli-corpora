00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.096
with five planets,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.376
and just like TRAPPIST,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.656
early on in their existence,
they were all finely tuned.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.896
They were actually tuned

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.936
into a tuning structure
proposed by Pythagoras himself,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.280
over 2,000 years before.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.976
But the system's actually
named after Kepler,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.456
discovered by the Kepler space telescope.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.736
And so, in the last few billion years,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.456
they've actually lost their tuning,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.176
quite a bit more than TRAPPIST has,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.056
and so what we're going to do
is go back in time

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.496
and imagine what
they would've sounded like

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.960
just as they were forming.
