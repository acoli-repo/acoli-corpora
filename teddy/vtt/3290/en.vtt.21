00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.680
And it's good to think
of the analogy of an orchestra.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.376
When everyone gets together
to start playing in an orchestra,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.136
they can't just dive into it, right?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.576
They have to all get in tune;

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.856
they have to make sure

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.776
their instruments resonate
with their neighbors' instruments,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.256
and something very similar happened
to TRAPPIST-1 early in its existence.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.096
When the planets were first forming,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.576
they were orbiting within a disc of gas,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.896
and while inside that disc,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.416
they can actually slide around

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.776
and adjust their orbits to their neighbors

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.896
until they're perfectly in tune.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.096
And it's a good thing they did
because this system is so compact --
