00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.216
And so the secret to musical harmony
really is simple ratios:

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.376
the simpler the ratio,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.576
the more pleasing or consonant
those two notes will sound together.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.776
And the more complex the ratio,
the more dissonant they will sound.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.416
And it's this interplay
between tension and release,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.176
or consonance and dissonance,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.160
that makes what we call music.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.080
