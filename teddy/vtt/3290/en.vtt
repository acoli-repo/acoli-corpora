00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.960
I'd like you all
to close your eyes, please ...

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.656
and imagine yourself sitting
in the middle of a large, open field

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.347
with the sun setting on your right.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.296
And as the sun sets,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.256
imagine that tonight
you don't just see the stars appear,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.296
but you're able to hear the stars appear

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.216
with the brightest stars
being the loudest notes

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
and the hotter, bluer stars
producing the higher-pitched notes.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.320
