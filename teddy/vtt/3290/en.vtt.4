00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.816
that the motions of the planets
along the celestial sphere

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.080
created harmonious music.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.416
And if you asked him,
"Why don't we hear anything?"

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.736
he'd say you can't hear it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.256
because you don't know
what it's like to not hear it;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.015
you don't know what true silence is.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.656

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.720
to hear how annoying
your refrigerator was.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.576
Maybe you buy that,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.320
but not everybody else was buying it,
including such names as Aristotle.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.016
(Laughter)

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.256
Exact words.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.296
(Laughter)

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.016
So I'll paraphrase his exact words.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.416
He said it's a nice idea,
