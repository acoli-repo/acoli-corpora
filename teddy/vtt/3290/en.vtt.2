00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.976
(Music)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.136
Or Orion, the hunter.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.920
(Music)

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.896
Or even Taurus, the bull.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.120
(Music)

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.496
We live in a musical universe,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.056
and we can use that to experience
it from a new perspective,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.136
and to share that perspective
with a wider range of people.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.496
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.816
(Music ends)

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.016
Now, when I tell people
I'm an astrophysicist,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.656
they're usually pretty impressed.
