00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.576
(Rhythm gets gradually faster)

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.016
(High pitch)

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.496
(Lowering pitch)

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.120
(Slow Rhythm)

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.616
So once a rhythm starts happening
more than about 20 times per second,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.856
your brain flips.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.960
It stops hearing it as a rhythm
and starts hearing it as a pitch.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.856
So what does this have to do
with astronomy?

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.920
Well, that's when we get
to the TRAPPIST-1 system.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.256
This is an exoplanetary system
discovered last February of 2017,
