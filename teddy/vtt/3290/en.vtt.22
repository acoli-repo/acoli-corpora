And it's a good thing they did
because this system is so compact --

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.056
a lot of mass in a tight space --

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.296
if every aspect of their orbits
wasn't very finely tuned,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.776
they would very quickly
disrupt each other's orbits,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.200
destroying the whole system.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.016
So it's really music
that is keeping this system alive --

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.920
and any of its potential inhabitants.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.960
But what does our solar system sound like?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.736
I hate to be the one to show you this,
but it's not pretty.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.656
(Laughter)

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.976
So for one thing,
