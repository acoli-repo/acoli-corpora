00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.056
So here we have the orbits
of the inner rocky planets

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.336
in our solar system:

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.856
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.456
and all seven Earth-sized
planets of TRAPPIST-1

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.840
are tucked well inside
the orbit of Mercury.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.936
I have to expand this by 25 times

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.680
for you to see the orbits
of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.896
It's actually much more similar in size
to our planet Jupiter and its moons,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.896
even though it's seven
Earth-size planets orbiting a star.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.320
Another reason this got everyone excited
was artist renderings like this.
