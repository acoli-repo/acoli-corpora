X-rays that will sterilize the surface
of life and even strip off atmospheres.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.656
Luckily, just a few months ago in 2018,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.616
some new papers came out
with more refined measurements,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.456
and they found actually
it does look something like that.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.496
(Laughter)

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.016
So we now know that several of them
have huge supplies of water --

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.256
global oceans --

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.016
and several of them
have thick atmospheres,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.200
so it's the right place to look
for potential life.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.776
But there's something even more
exciting about this system,
