00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.576
That's Neptune.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.616
(Two tones)

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.840
Uranus.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.256
(Three tones)

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.496
Saturn.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.976
(Four tones)

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.496
Jupiter.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.896
And then tucked in, that's Mars.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.936
(Five tones)

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.976
(Six tones)

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.200
Earth.

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:16.736
(Seven tones)

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.960
Venus.

00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:19.776
(Eight tones)

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.016
And that's Mercury --

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.256
OK, OK, I'll stop.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.136
(Laughter)

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.656
So this was actually Kepler's dream.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.096
Johannes Kepler is the person

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.296
that figured out
the laws of planetary motion.
