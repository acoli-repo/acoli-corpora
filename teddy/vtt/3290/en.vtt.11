00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.256
This is an exoplanetary system
discovered last February of 2017,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.616
and it got everyone excited

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.416
because it is seven Earth-sized planets
all orbiting a very near red dwarf star.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.296
And we think that three of the planets

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.416
have the right temperature
for liquid water.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.616
It's also so close
that in the next few years,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.336
we should be able to detect
elements in their atmospheres

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.920
such as oxygen and methane --
potential signs of life.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.216
But one thing about
the TRAPPIST system is that it is tiny.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.056
So here we have the orbits
of the inner rocky planets
