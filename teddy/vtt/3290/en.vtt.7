00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.760
Take a look at the string on the far left.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.656
If you bow that string,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.336
it will produce a note as it oscillates
very fast back and forth.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.736
(Musical note)

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.696
But now if you cut the string in half,
you'll get two strings,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.816
each oscillating twice as fast.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.776
And that will produce a related note.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.120
Or three times as fast,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.256
or four times --

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.120
(Musical notes)

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.216
And so the secret to musical harmony
really is simple ratios:
