That wild man in the chaps ...

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.900
was me.

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:34.984
(Laughter)

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:36.649
(Applause)

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:40.399
(Cheers)

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:48.161
And the answer
to the question, surprisingly,

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:49.344
is yes.

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:50.518
(Laughter)

00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:53.503
I grew up watching professional wrestling

00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:54.705
with my dad.

00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.385
And like him, I loved everything about it:

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.453
the showmanship, the athletic skill,

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:00.717
the drama.
