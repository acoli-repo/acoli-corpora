00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:00.803
just like the rest of us.

00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:03.549
My one son -- he's a whiz at electronics.

00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:07.284
So maybe helping him turn up
makes him become the next Steve Jobs.

00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:10.831
My other son and my daughter --
they're great at art,

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.912
so maybe helping them turn up their gifts

00:12:12.936 --> 00:12:15.310
helps them become the next Pablo Picasso.

00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:18.447
You never know what
you have the ability to do

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.676
until you dig.

00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:22.890
And don't be afraid
to put yourself out there.

00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:24.068
I mean, look around.

00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:26.787
They say that if you get nervous
in front of an audience,

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:28.778
just imagine them in their underwear.

00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:31.042
But then I think, "Hey,
I've wrestled in less."
