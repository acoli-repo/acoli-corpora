00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:31.133
but I really didn't care.

00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:32.742
So the first thing I thought was,

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.555
"How can I amplify something as simple
as: comfortable with my own body?"

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.520
I didn't know.

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:40.509
And then I thought:

00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:42.518
Speedo.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.140
(Laughter)

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.011
(Applause)

00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:53.785
Or "trunks,"

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.212
as we call them in wrestling.

00:05:55.904 --> 00:05:57.054
Yeah, trunks.

00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:58.238
I could be this big guy

00:05:58.262 --> 00:06:00.513
who was comfortable
wearing these little trunks
