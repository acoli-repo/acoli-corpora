00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:31.042
But then I think, "Hey,
I've wrestled in less."

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:32.969
(Laughter)

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:37.805
(Applause)

00:12:41.272 --> 00:12:44.162
Look, the wrestling circus doesn't need
to come to your town

00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:46.538
before you get an invitation
to be the real you --

00:12:46.562 --> 00:12:48.725
the bigger, more stunning
version of yourself.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.629
It doesn't even necessarily
come from our parents.

00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:55.229
Turning yourself up means looking inward
toward our true selves

00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:56.968
and harnessing the voice that says,

00:12:56.992 --> 00:12:58.991
"Maybe, just maybe,

00:12:59.015 --> 00:13:00.864
I am more than I thought I was."
