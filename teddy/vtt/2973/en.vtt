00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:04.684
Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:06.365
in a cowboy hat and chaps,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.543
is in the ring

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.974
as the arena full of fans cheer him on.

00:00:19.494 --> 00:00:21.586
crashing down onto Gator's rib cage.

Gator struggles to breathe, wondering:

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.849
"Is this really what my father
wanted for me?"

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:29.558
(Laughter)

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:31.732
That wild man in the chaps ...
