00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:00.904
I went with "Gator."

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:03.215
I also wrestled in a t-shirt
and camouflage pants

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.537
because that's what I had in my closet.

00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:09.340
I hadn't quite figured out
how to develop my own persona yet,

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:10.515
but I was learning.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.373
It was sort of like an apprenticeship.

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:13.564
But I was a wrestler.

00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:15.560
And my dad would come to all my matches

00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:18.463
wearing a t-shirt that said,
"Papa Gator" across the front.

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:19.638
(Laughter)

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:21.000
And he'd brag to his friends

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:23.988
about how his son was going to pay
for his retirement someday.

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:25.035
(Laughter)

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.442
And I would've.

00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:29.445
Not long after I started wrestling,

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.527
my dad unexpectedly passed away.
