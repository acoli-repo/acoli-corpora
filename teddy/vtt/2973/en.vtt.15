I'm sitting there watching TV one night,
flipping through the channels,

00:07:32.604 --> 00:07:33.952
and this commercial comes on

00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:37.432

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.614
Tim McGraw.

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:40.645
He's a cool cowboy with a great last name.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.844
And I liked his music.

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:43.875
It was just all part of my process.

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:45.634
But I just kept turning myself up

00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:49.592
until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw!

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:51.627
(Laughter)

00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:55.519
(Applause)

00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:01.857
And I knew that if I kept
turning myself up
