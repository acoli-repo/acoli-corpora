When I was 16,

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:34.047
a small wrestling show came
to my little town in Minnesota.

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:35.241
I couldn't believe it.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:37.881
Nothing like that had ever
come to my town before.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:40.962
So I got to the arena
early in the morning the day of the show,

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:44.225
waiting out in the parking lot
to see if I could spot some wrestlers

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:45.485
pulling up in their cars.

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:48.384
It wasn't as creepy as it sounds.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.640
But I could definitely tell
who the wrestlers were,

00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:52.894
just the way they walked.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:55.102
They were tall and confident
and intimidating,

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.149
with their tank tops
and Zubaz and fanny packs.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.571
Why wouldn't I want to be them?
