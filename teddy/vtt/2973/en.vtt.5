00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.027
They would come to my town for one night
every couple of months that year,

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.224
and then -- poof! --
next day, they were gone.

00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:36.406
By the next year,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.295
they finally told me about an actual
wrestling training camp

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.146
that one of the wrestlers was running,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.521
and I begged my parents to sign me up.

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:46.413
Next thing I knew,
I was a high school senior by day

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:48.786
and wrestling in front of live
audiences by night.

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:52.975
I had this giant poster of an alligator
hanging on my bedroom wall.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.234
So when I needed to come up with
a wrestling name at the last minute

00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:58.558
and Jesse "The Body" Ventura
was already taken --

00:02:58.582 --> 00:02:59.600
(Laughter)

00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:00.904
I went with "Gator."
