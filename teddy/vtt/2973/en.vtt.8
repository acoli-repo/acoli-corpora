Wrestling belonged to me
and my dad, you know?

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:04.657
So there I was,

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.026
sitting in the locker room,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.379
getting ready for a match within days
of my dad passing away.

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:11.326
He was gone.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.241
And sitting there alone --

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:16.846
it felt like I was hiding.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.887
But it also felt like
I needed to be there.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.920
One of the wrestlers who'd been
on the scene a long time

00:04:23.944 --> 00:04:25.403
knew what I was going through,

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:27.695
and he came over to see
how I was holding up.

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.395
I couldn't get the words out.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.285
I just said, "I don't know
what I'm doing."
