00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.728
Maybe I could go from the boy
who made his buddies laugh

00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:36.786
to the man who could rally
hundreds or thousands.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.097
So I committed to the idea

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.392
that my character wasn't going to be
as scary as some of the others.

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:44.232
I'd be hilarious from the moment
I walked into the arena.

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:46.564
With every wrestling match, I dug deeper.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.143
I found out that I could laugh at myself.

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.581
So this guy would dance
and sing his entrance music

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:53.118
all the way to the ring.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:54.772
That was dancing, by the way.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.113
(Laughter)

00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:57.964
I found out that I was an OK wrestler,

00:06:57.988 --> 00:06:59.822
but I was an even better entertainer.

00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:02.908
And turning myself up made me
unforgettable to the fans.
