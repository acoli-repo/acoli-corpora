00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.480
I wrestled my final match,

00:10:31.504 --> 00:10:33.526
and walked away
from professional wrestling

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.383
to pursue the next chapter of my life.

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:37.478
And as time passed,

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:39.436
the strangest thing started to happen.

00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:42.169
I found out that once someone
has been turned up,

00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:44.023
it's pretty hard to turn them down.

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:47.023
I left the ring but Gator stayed with me,

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.969
and I use the turned-up version
of myself every day.

00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:53.973
My beautiful wife has been with me
through this entire journey.

00:10:53.997 --> 00:10:57.219
And by the way --
she does not like pro wrestling.

00:10:57.243 --> 00:10:58.464
(Laughter)

00:10:58.488 --> 00:10:59.638
Like, at all.
