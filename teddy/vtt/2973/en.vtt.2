the drama.

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:04.514
I'd be this little boy, bouncing
all over our living room,

00:01:04.538 --> 00:01:07.098
pretending to be my favorite
wrestlers from TV.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.161
My dad actually reminded me
a little bit of Hulk Hogan,

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:12.740
but I was Hulk Hogan
and he was Andre the Giant.

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:15.727
I'd get all serious on him
and say things like, "Dad ...

00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:19.561
someday I am going to be
world heavyweight champion."

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:23.737
And he would usually smile
and very calmly say,

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:28.623
"OK, then I guess I can count on you
to be my retirement fund."

00:01:28.647 --> 00:01:29.995
