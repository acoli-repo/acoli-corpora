00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.152
I got to walk down the WWE Raw
entrance ramp on live television --

00:08:35.176 --> 00:08:36.326
(Laughter)

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:39.818
dressed up as a fake security guard --

00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:40.850
(Laughter)

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:42.827
to escort another wrestler to the ring.

00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:44.454
(Laughter)

00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:47.626
Sure, I was disappointed
I didn't get to wrestle,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.563
but very few wrestlers get
any kind of call from the WWE.

00:08:50.587 --> 00:08:52.454
Maybe one in a few hundred.

00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:56.163
And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw
is what got me there.

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:59.709
So instead of walking away that day,

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:01.674
I decided to turn myself up again
