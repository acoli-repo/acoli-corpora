00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:01.674
I decided to turn myself up again

00:09:01.698 --> 00:09:03.870
and become the best
security guard I could.

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:05.732
In fact, I did it so well,

00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:08.499
I was the only guard to get
a close-up on TV that night.

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:11.378
That's a big deal, you know?

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:12.627
(Laughter)

00:09:14.503 --> 00:09:16.897
And I got to sit backstage that entire day

00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.619
with some of the most famous
pro wrestlers in the world,

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.736
some of which were heroes
of mine as a kid.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.563
And I got to listen to them
and learn from them,

00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:26.613
and for that day,

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.457
I was accepted as one of them.

00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:32.610
Maybe my experience
with the WWE wasn't ideal.
