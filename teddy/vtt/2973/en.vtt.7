00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.527
my dad unexpectedly passed away.

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:36.379
And as you can imagine,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:38.459
especially as a teenage boy,

00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:39.797
it destroyed me.

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:44.335
If you've ever lost someone,

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.624
you know what a difficult
time that can be.

00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:49.118
Your mind -- it's not working right.

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:50.882
The whole thing is just so surreal.

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.673
I wanted to feel normal again,
even if it was for just a second,

00:03:56.697 --> 00:03:59.255
so I went back to wrestling
almost immediately.

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.256
Wrestling belonged to me
and my dad, you know?
