00:05:58.262 --> 00:06:00.513
who was comfortable
wearing these little trunks

00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:02.129
in front of a bunch of strangers.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.316
So I ditched the t-shirt
and camouflage pants,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.086
and Gator's new wardrobe was born.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.463
(Laughter)

00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:09.562
I was also pretty good
at drawing cartoons,

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:11.460
so I wondered if I could turn that up.

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.267
I could design my own wrestling costumes,

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:17.539
so each pair of trunks would have
its own unique design and color,

00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:19.736
all of them completely different --

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.862
and extremely comfortable, by the way.

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:23.036
(Laughter)

00:06:23.672 --> 00:06:25.610
And I was also the funny kid in school,

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:26.784
believe it or not.

00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:29.235
So I thought maybe I could turn that up.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.728
Maybe I could go from the boy
who made his buddies laugh
