00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:01.361
So there I sat --

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.456
a scared teenager
who didn't know who he was

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.619
or why he was even wrestling anymore.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:09.372
I looked around the locker room
at some of the other wrestlers,

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.570
and I thought,

00:05:10.594 --> 00:05:13.110
"I look so different.
How can I ever be like them?"

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:14.992
And then it hit me.

00:05:15.422 --> 00:05:18.363
That's the moment I realized
I didn't have to be like them.

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.219
What I did have to do was find out:
What did it mean to be me?

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.321
What made me unique,

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:26.209
and how could I use it to my advantage?

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:29.819
I knew I wasn't a chiseled athlete
like some of these guys,

00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:31.133
but I really didn't care.
