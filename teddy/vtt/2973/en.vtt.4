00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.571
Why wouldn't I want to be them?

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:01.828
(Laughter)

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.443
All I could think about
was who are these people,

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:05.917
and what are they like?

00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:07.661
How did they become wrestlers?

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.715
So before the show started,

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.006
I walked into this tiny arena --

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.819
more like a gymnasium --

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:16.632
and I asked them if I could help
set up the wrestling ring.

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:18.269
"Sure, kid. No problem."

00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:22.240
And then I pleaded with them
to show me some wrestling moves.

00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:24.602
"Sure, kid. No problem."

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:27.626
Man, they would just punch
and kick me -- hard!

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.467
But I never complained.

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.027
They would come to my town for one night
every couple of months that year,
