00:00:00.864 --> 00:00:04.301
It was October 6, 2012,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:07.504
and I would have killed
for Wendyâ€™s frosty.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.375
I've been craving that frosty
for about two days,

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:15.178
but it always seemed just out of reach.

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.882
See, after urgent care turned
into "tomorrow after school,"

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.786
which then became "we need
to go back to urgent care now."

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:26.857
And finally in the car
on the way to the hospital,

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:31.929
I realized that, unfortunately,
I would not be getting that frosty.
