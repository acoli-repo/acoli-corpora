00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We like to dance together, we like singing together.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with a first experiment today. The experiment is --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that you did it in a typical North American way,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that is, you were raucous and incoherent.
