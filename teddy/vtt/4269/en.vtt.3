00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:33.812
I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:36.669
I can even pat myself on the back when necessary,

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:41.168
all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:46.847
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:51.296
and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:59.063
I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:04.424
and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,
