Some of you may be calling it, what,

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:05.461
the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?

00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:10.661
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.

00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:15.566
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens

00:10:15.566 --> 00:10:19.471
and it's all written down in plain sight.

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:25.177
I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?

00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:29.386
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?

00:10:29.386 --> 00:10:33.074
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
