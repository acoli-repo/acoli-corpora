00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:42.048
All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,

00:11:42.048 --> 00:11:45.763
also known as the U.S. Constitution.

00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:49.435
Specifically, this little amendment right here:

00:11:49.435 --> 00:11:54.686
"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities

00:11:54.686 --> 00:11:58.924
of citizens of the United States."

00:11:58.924 --> 00:12:01.965
