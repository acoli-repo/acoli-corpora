When I was about 16 years old

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:07.441
I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.971
looking for a movie to watch on HBO --

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.484
and how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:17.485
Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.197
"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:23.769
It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.886
I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:33.639
But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.
