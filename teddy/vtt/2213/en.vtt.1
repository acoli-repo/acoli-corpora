00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.835
And, I mean, look at it --
it's got a face with a permanent smile.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.865
(Laughter)

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:34.353
It's framed by feathery gills.

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:36.421
It's just ... how could you not love that?

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.357
This particular type of axolotl,
a very close relative,

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.986
is known as an achoque.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.491
It is equally as cute,

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:48.219
and it lives in just one place
in a lake in the north of Mexico.

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:49.984
It's called Lake Pátzcuaro,

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.649
and as you can see,

00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:54.198
it is stunningly beautiful.

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:57.404
But unfortunately, it's been so overfished
and so badly polluted

00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:59.996
that the achoque is dying out altogether.
