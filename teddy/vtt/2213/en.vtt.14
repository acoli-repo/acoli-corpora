00:06:59.504 --> 00:07:02.501
Shackleton just didn't listen
to the whalers in South Georgia.

00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:06.366
They knew that region, and they told him
you won't get through the ice this year.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.217
It's too widespread, it's too far north,
it's too dangerous.

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:10.575
And look what happened.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.876
I mean, granted, that great adventure,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.073
that story of heroic leadership
that we still tell,

00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:18.199
where he saved
every single one of his men,

00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:21.493
we wouldn't be telling that story
if he'd just hightailed it for home

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:22.675
and taken their advice.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:23.902
But it cost him his ship,

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:26.772
I would imagine quite a lot
of cold injuries among the team,

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:28.044
a good few cases of PTSD

00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.791
and Mrs. Chippy,
the ship's cat, had to be shot
