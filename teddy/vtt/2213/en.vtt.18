00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:00.108
This was a product of humility,

00:09:00.132 --> 00:09:01.345
of listening,

00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:04.702
and I saw that in spades
when I visited Pátzcuaro.

00:09:05.058 --> 00:09:08.506
So I watched as a decades-experienced
conservation biologist

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.846
called Gerardo Garcia

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.836
listened and watched super carefully

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.351
as a nun in a full habit
and wimple and latex gloves

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.408
showed him how, if you tap
an achoque on the head really gently,

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:20.667
it'll open its mouth so you can quickly
get a DNA swab with a Q-tip.

00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:22.180
(Laughter)

00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:27.230
When scientists team up with,
look to and defer to people

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:30.424
who have a really valuable perspective
on what they're trying to do
