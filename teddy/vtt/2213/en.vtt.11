00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:31.429
I've traveled to loads of places
and just basically followed around

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:35.445
brilliant people who are trying
to use science to answer big questions

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.214
and solve problems.

00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:40.105
I've hung out with scientists
who have solved the mystery

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.816
of the origin of the menopause
by tracking killer whales

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.598
off the north Pacific coast.

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:46.305
And I've followed around scientists

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.169
who've planted cameras
in Antarctic penguin colonies,

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.354
because they were looking to capture
the impacts of climate change

00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:53.901
as it happens.

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:57.149
But it's this team
that really stuck with me,

00:05:57.173 --> 00:05:58.760
that really showed me the impact

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.839
that these delicate but really
important relationships can have.
