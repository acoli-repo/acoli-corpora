OK, I would like to introduce all of you
beautiful, curious-minded people

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.330
to my favorite animal in the world.

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:11.902
This is the Peter Pan
of the amphibian world.

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:13.608
It's an axolotl.

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:15.106
It's a type of salamander,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.951
but it never fully grows up
and climbs out of the water

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.766
like other salamanders do.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:23.436
And this little guy has
X-Man-style powers, right?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.261
So if it loses any limb,

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:27.520
it can just completely regenerate.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:28.695
It's amazing.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.835
And, I mean, look at it --
it's got a face with a permanent smile.
