00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.312

It tastes a bit like honey,

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.544
but the sisters reckon it is good

00:03:15.568 --> 00:03:18.617
for all kinds of particularly
respiratory ailments.

00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.584
So I just want you to have a listen,

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:30.921
here in Pátzcuaro in 1747.
