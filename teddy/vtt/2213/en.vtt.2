00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.454
And this is something that's a scenario
that's playing out all over the world.

00:01:04.478 --> 00:01:07.263
We're living through an extinction crisis,

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.899
and species are particularly vulnerable
when they're evolutionarily tailored

00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:13.807
to just one little niche
or maybe one lake.

00:01:14.438 --> 00:01:15.598
But this is TED, right?

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:18.431
So this is where I give you
the big idea, the big solution.

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:22.604
So how do you save one special
weird species from going extinct?

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:24.894
Well, the answer, at least my answer,

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.971
isn't a grand technological intervention.

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:28.370
It's actually really simple.

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.781
It's that you find people
who know all about this animal
