00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:30.921
here in Pátzcuaro in 1747.

00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:33.160
Sometime after that,

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:36.367
our sisters started to make
the achoque syrup.

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:38.964
We didn't discover
the properties of the achoque.

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:44.224
That was the original people
from around here, since ancient times.

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:46.973
But we then started to make
the syrup, too.

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:48.180
The locals knew that,

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:50.810
and they came to offer us the animals.

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:52.243
(Audio) Victoria Gill: I see.

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:55.169
So the achoques are
part of making that syrup.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.932
What does the syrup treat,
and what is it for?

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:01.046
