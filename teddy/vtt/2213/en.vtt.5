00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:32.367
and they have a shared history
with the achoque.

00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.493
And it is so mind-bogglingly wonderful

00:02:34.517 --> 00:02:38.075
that it drew me all the way there
to make an audio documentary about them,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.330
and I even have the unflattering selfie

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:41.946
to prove it.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.892
There is a room at the center
of their convent, though,

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.069
that looks like this.

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:47.255
It's very strange.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.843
It's lined with all these tanks
full of fresh water

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:52.170
and hundreds of achoques.

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.993
And that's because this creature,
because of its regenerative abilities,

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:59.692
it's believed has healing powers
if you consume it.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:05.108
So the sisters actually make and sell
a medicine using achoques.
