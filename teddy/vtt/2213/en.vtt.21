00:10:29.313 --> 00:10:31.675
who have this formidable task
of bringing together

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.097
all of that biological
and ecological information

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:36.162
that paints a clear and accurate picture

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:38.829
of the state of the natural world.

00:10:38.853 --> 00:10:41.593
And 10 years before this panel
even set out to do that,

00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:43.199
to put that assessment together,

00:10:43.223 --> 00:10:46.541
they created what's called
a "cultural concept framework."

00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:50.885
This is essentially
a cultural concept translation dictionary

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:55.202
for all of the different ways
that we talk about the natural world.

00:10:55.226 --> 00:10:57.409
So it formally recognizes, for example,

00:10:57.433 --> 00:11:01.492
that "Mother Earth" and "nature"
means the same thing.
