All of us here are providing happiness
by protecting this animal,

00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:07.114
and we're also making Him happy.

00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:11.940
(Audio) (Nuns singing)

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:18.893
VG: I feel like I should sort of slink off
and let the nuns sing me out,

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:20.736
because it sounds so lovely.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.029
But did you hear that?

00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:23.965
"We're providing happiness."

00:13:23.989 --> 00:13:26.341
Now, that's not a protocol
you'd ever see outlined

00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:28.673
in any formal research project proposal --

00:13:28.697 --> 00:13:29.752
(Laughter)

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:33.962
but it's the impetus behind what's become
the most successful breeding program
