00:11:27.548 --> 00:11:31.538
than a scientist who spent many years
going to and from that region

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:33.027
taking measurements.

00:11:33.496 --> 00:11:37.405
And collectively, Indigenous people
are the caretakers

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:42.817
of an estimated 25 percent
of the entire global land surface,

00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:46.626
including some of the most biodiverse
places on the planet.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.764
So imagine how much we're missing

00:11:49.788 --> 00:11:52.027
if we don't cross
those cultural boundaries,

00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:53.329
or at least try to,

00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:55.780
when we're trying to figure out
how the world works

00:11:55.804 --> 00:11:57.120
and how to protect it.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.455
Every single research proposal
is a new opportunity to do exactly that.
