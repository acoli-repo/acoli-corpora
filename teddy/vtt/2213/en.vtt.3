00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.781
It's that you find people
who know all about this animal

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.484
and you ask them and you listen to them

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.060
and you work with them,
if they're up for that.

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.234
So I want to tell you about
how I've seen that in science,

00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:43.917
and in conservation in particular,

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:46.777
if scientists don't team up
with local people

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.102
who have really valuable knowledge

00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:52.945
but a practical wisdom that's not going
to be published in any academic journal,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.623
they can really miss the point.

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:59.160
Scientists and science as an enterprise
can fall at the first hurdle

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:03.395
if it rushes in knowing
that it's the experts that know best.
