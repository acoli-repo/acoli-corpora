00:06:28.996 --> 00:06:31.594
of a kind of academically blinkered hubris

00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:35.043
that has kept science historically
an enterprise for the elite.

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:36.959
And I think although that's moved on,

00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:40.578
it continues to be
its downfall on occasion.

00:06:41.673 --> 00:06:46.116
So here's my example from history

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.542
and my takedown of a scientific hero.

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:51.944
Sir Ernest Shackleton

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:55.867
and his Trans-Antarctic Expedition
more than a century ago,

00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:58.305
the celebrated ill-fated adventure.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:59.480
On his way there,

00:06:59.504 --> 00:07:02.501
Shackleton just didn't listen
to the whalers in South Georgia.
