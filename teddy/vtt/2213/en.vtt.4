00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:03.395
if it rushes in knowing
that it's the experts that know best.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.252
But when scientists shake off
those academic constraints

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:09.144
and really look to people
who have a totally different

00:02:09.168 --> 00:02:12.153
but really important perspective
on what they're trying to do,

00:02:12.177 --> 00:02:13.905
it can genuinely save the world,

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.967
one wonderfully weird amphibian at a time.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.846
So, in the case of the achoque,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.905
these are the people
you need on your team.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:22.945
(Laughter)

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.762
These are the Sisters
of the Immaculate Health.

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:29.578
They are nuns who have a convent
in Pátzcuaro, they live in Pátzcuaro,

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:32.367
and they have a shared history
with the achoque.
