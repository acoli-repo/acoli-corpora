00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:31.378
actually nearly put a halt
to that medicine production altogether,

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:33.693
which is why the sisters started this.

00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:36.004
It's the world's first achoque farm.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.791
All they wanted was a healthy,
sustainable population

00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:41.170
so that they could continue
to make that medicine,

00:04:41.194 --> 00:04:43.186
but what they created at the same time

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.468
was a captive breeding program
for a critically endangered species.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:48.928
And fast forward a few years,

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:51.446
and these scientists
that you can see in this picture

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.653
from Chester Zoo
all the way over the in UK,

00:04:53.677 --> 00:04:54.971
not far from where I live,

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.126
and from Michoacana University
in Morelia in Mexico

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.345
have persuaded the sisters --
it took years of careful diplomacy --
