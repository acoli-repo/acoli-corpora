Every single research proposal
is a new opportunity to do exactly that.

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:07.084
So what if, every time
a research project was proposed,

00:12:07.108 --> 00:12:10.861
it had to include a suggestion
of a person or a group of people --

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:14.427
local farmers, Indigenous
community leaders, nuns --

00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:16.852
that researchers wanted
to bring into the fold,

00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:19.420
invite into their team and listen to?

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:22.813
I just want to let
Sister Ofelia give her view

00:12:22.837 --> 00:12:26.349
of why she is so particularly
driven and dedicated

00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:28.512
to the survival of the achoque.
