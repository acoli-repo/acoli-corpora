00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:32.897
producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.737
By the end of the 14th century,

00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:39.727
Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable

00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:43.097
that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.507
to take control of the growing 
cheese trade.

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:49.237
Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance,

00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:52.977
and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:54.587
and into machinery.

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:59.647
Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year,

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:02.327
shipped and consumed around the globe.
