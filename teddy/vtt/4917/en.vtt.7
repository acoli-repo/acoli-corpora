alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:37.178
This grating cheese was produced in Sicily

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:41.158
and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:45.297
Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,”

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:46.857
became an essential ration

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:53.397
for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire.

00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:56.238
And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed,

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:58.308
cheesemaking continued to evolve

00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:02.388
in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside.
