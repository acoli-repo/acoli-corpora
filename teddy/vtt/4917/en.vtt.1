00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:33.200
The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.110
which ancient farmers harvested for milk.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.540
But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.160
that fresh milk began to sour.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.740
Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.520
Upon discovering this 
strange transformation,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150
the farmers drained the remaining liquid –

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.760
later named whey –

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.510
and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal.
