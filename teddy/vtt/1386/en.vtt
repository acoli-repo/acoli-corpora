00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, 120 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Dr. RÃ¶ntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That image was the start of the X-ray technology.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The first shot I ever did

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
