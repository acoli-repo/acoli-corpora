You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.

And what this teacher did on every project

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and then something like science.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So they had created these artifacts.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But the whole point of this thing is
