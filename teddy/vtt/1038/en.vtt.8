00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
little additional parts for our brain --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
made out of powerful ideas that help us

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
see the world in different ways.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in the ability to change perspective on things.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I'll talk about that a little bit.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's this change in perspective

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
on what it is we think we're perceiving
