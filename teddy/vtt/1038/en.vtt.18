and bingo. That is all you have to do.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in order to get an idea of what it means

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Now let's go to young children.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
This is a very unusual teacher

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but was a natural mathematician.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music
