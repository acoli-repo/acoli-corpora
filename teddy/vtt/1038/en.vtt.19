00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but was a natural mathematician.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but is a terrific musician;

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
she just had a feeling for math.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And here are her six-year-olds,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
