He would have a great time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
he had a secret weapon yesterday,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
literally, in his sword swallowing act.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
