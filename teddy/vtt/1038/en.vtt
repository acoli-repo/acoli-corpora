00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what's going on with no difficulty at all.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but would miss the point.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He would have a great time.
