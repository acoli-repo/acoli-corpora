if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
happening inside here. It's a waking dream,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And what that means: "simple and understandable"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
might not be actually simple or understandable,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
