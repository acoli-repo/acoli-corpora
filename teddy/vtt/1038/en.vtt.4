00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She does this with cardboard, but since I have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
an expensive computer here

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.
