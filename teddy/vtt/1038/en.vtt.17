00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
three more triangles and we copy that,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
notice that we can move those triangles down like this.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and bingo. That is all you have to do.
