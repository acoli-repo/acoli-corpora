and I found that they matched up very well.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000

without removing what's important about the data.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000

of the simulation of the inside of a cell,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000

but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
