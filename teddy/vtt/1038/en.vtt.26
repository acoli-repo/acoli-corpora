00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I just drag these guys out and set them going.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And I can try steering the car here by ...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
See the car turn by five here?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So what if I click this down to zero?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Make it go in the other direction.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
as far as driving a car,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
so the kids want to do a steering wheel;

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
so they draw a steering wheel.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And we'll call this a wheel.
