00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And it was not until Galileo actually did it

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
that an adult thought like a child,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
only 400 years ago.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
who will actually cut straight to the chase.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
We can take a movie of what's going on,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
but even if we single stepped this movie,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it's tricky to see what's going on.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
or stack them up.
