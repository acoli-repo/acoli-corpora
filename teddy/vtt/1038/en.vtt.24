That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And so the first idea here is

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
just to show you the kind of things that children do.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So I'd like to draw a little car here --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.
