00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of having the descriptions

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
at various levels be rather similar --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
are both sticky and standoffish,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and they're in violent motion.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Those three things give rise to all the different levels

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of what seem to be complexity in our world.
