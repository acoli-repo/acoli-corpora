00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They measure very, very carefully.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you'll see that those two shapes are

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
exactly the same size.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
who had that insight back then,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
