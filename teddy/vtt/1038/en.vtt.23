00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
will recognize these two progressions

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
as a first-order discrete differential equation

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and a second-order discrete differential equation,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
derived by six-year-olds.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Well, that's pretty amazing.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.
