She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
around the edges was always going to grow by two,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
where she wasn't sure what six times six was

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and what seven times seven was,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but then she was confident again.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So that's what Lauren did.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"
