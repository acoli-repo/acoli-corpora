00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
they never forget from this single trial

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
what a variable is and how to use it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So if you look at the little script here,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the speed is always going to be 30.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,
