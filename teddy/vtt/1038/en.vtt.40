It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
so this is actually cheap.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And Einstein said,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Thank you.
