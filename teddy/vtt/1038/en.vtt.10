If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the simplicity gets complex

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
another name for them could be "architecture"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
as a metaphor for taking the same old material

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --
