00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
about molecular biology, and that is:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
finding each other just the right way

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so they combine together and be catalyzed?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And what we saw yesterday was

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
every reaction was fortuitous;

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
about a million revolutions per second;
