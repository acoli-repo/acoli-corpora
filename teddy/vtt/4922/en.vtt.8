00:03:55.713 --> 00:04:00.953
Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first.

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:03.847
But before the dwarves could have their due,


00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:09.057
clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck,

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.937
and thus had no right to cut it.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:15.941
All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh.

00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:20.161
Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.351
and sewed his mouth shut,


00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:27.071
so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit.


00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.141
Yet the irony was not lost on the gods.
