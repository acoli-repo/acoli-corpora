00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:30.503
For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.563
on every ninth night.


00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:35.713
And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir.

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:39.763
Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect.

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:43.163
But then Brokk revealed its abilities.


00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:46.463
Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark

00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:50.433
and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:55.713
Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all.

00:03:55.713 --> 00:04:00.953
Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first.
