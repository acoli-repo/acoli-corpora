a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything.

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:11.663
And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr,

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:13.313
god of the harvest.


00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:17.433
Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother.


00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.793
For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:25.573
who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount.

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:30.503
For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings
