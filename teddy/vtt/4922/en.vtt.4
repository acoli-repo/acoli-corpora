00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:02.114
Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason,

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:04.274
or the treasures would be ruined.

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:07.554
Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room.

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:12.304
As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand,

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:13.954
but he didn’t flinch.


00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:18.574
Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck.


00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:20.114
The dwarf carried on.

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:24.094
Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:30.444
This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could.
