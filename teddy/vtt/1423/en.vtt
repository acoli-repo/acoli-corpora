00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:02.970
Two years ago, after having served four years

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.630
in the United States Marine Corps

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.990
and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.939
I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.176
of veterans and medical professionals

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:14.609
in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.135
three days after the earthquake.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.298
We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:21.829
the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.835
we realized something. Military veterans

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.848
are very, very good at disaster response.

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:30.323
And coming home, my cofounder and I,
