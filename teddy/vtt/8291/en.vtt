00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.124
About a decade ago,

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:07.003
I met someone who had experienced
a few episodes of schizophrenia.

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:11.257
They had felt that their sense of self,

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:13.843
of what it feels like to be them,

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.219
changing somewhat.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:20.183
The boundaries of their body
began to feel a bit nebulous.

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:25.063
Even their psychological self
felt a bit porous at times.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:30.234
They were experiencing what could be
called an altered sense of self.
