00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:01.518
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,
minutes away from Ferguson,

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:03.011
and not go see.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.477
So I got off my ass to go check it out.

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:06.941
When I got out there,

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.374
I found something surprising.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.688
I found anger; there was a lot of that.

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:15.779
But what I found more of was love.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.653
People with love for themselves.

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.317
Love for their community.

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.030
And it was beautiful --

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:23.643
until the police showed up.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:28.414
Then a new emotion was interjected
into the conversation:

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.198
fear.
