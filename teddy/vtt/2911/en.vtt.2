00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.337
I remember thinking,

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.120
he ain't the first,

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:06.008
and he won't be the last young kid
to lose his life to law enforcement.

00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:08.149
But see, his death was different.

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:10.388
When Mike was killed,

00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:13.876
I remember the powers that be
trying to use fear as a weapon.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.708
The police response to a community
in mourning was to use force

00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:19.955
to impose fear:

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:22.362
fear of militarized police,

00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:24.142
imprisonment,

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.335
fines.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.879
The media even tried
to make us afraid of each other

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:29.455
by the way they spun the story.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.838
And all of these things
have worked in the past.
