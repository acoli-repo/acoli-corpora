00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.096
and the people that use their power
to spread fear and hate,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.864
especially in times like these.

00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:38.238
So I'm going to ask you.

00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:40.040
Y'all the movers and the shakers,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.604
you know, the thought leaders:

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.468
What are you gonna do

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.515
with the gifts that you've been given

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.980
to break us from the fear
the binds us every day?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.539
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:54.440
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:58.746
But once I figured out that fear
was not put in me to cripple me,

00:04:59.573 --> 00:05:01.225
it was there to protect me,
