00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.198
fear.

00:02:30.627 --> 00:02:32.312
Now, I'm not going to lie;

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.130
when I saw those armored vehicles,

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.315
and all that gear

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.705
and all those guns

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.490
and all those police

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:40.977
I was terrified --

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.176
personally.

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.725
And when I looked around that crowd,

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.511
I saw a lot of people that had
the same thing going on.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.728
But I also saw people
with something else inside of them.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.823
That was courage.

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:55.225
See, those people yelled,

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.491
and they screamed,

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:59.067
and they were not about
to back down from the police.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:00.739
They were past that point.
