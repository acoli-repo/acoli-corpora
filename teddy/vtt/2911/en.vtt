00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:02.698
So, I'm afraid.

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:05.072
Right now,

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.617
on this stage,

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:07.859
I feel fear.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.802
In my life, I ain't met many people

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:13.056
that will readily admit
when they are afraid.

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:15.641
And I think that's because deep down,

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.373
they know how easy it spreads.

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:20.023
See, fear is like a disease.

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:23.200
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:25.490
But what happens when,

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.264
even in the face of that fear,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:28.775
you do what you've got to do?

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:30.623
That's called courage.
