00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:03.509
And myself and my friend,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.102
and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.304
did just that with our documentary,

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:09.639
"Whose Streets?"

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.608
I kind of became a conduit

00:04:13.632 --> 00:04:17.154
for all of this courage
that was given to me.

00:04:17.178 --> 00:04:20.367
And I think that's part
of our job as artists.

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:24.781
I think we should be conveyors
of courage in the work that we do.

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:29.616
And I think that we are the wall
between the normal folks

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.096
and the people that use their power
to spread fear and hate,
