00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.364
things that would give people voice

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.120
and things that would fortify them
for the road ahead.

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:38.467
I did a project where I took pictures
of the hands of protesters

00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:42.480
and put them up and down
the boarded-up buildings

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:44.180
and community shops.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.490
My goal was to raise awareness
and to raise the morale.

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:50.915
And I think, for a minute at least,

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.185
it did just that.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.490
Then I thought, I want to uplift
the stories of these people

00:03:57.514 --> 00:03:59.920
I was watching being
courageous in the moment.
