00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.896
What does that mean? Another jargon.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.696
It actually means
designing information campaigns

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.136
so that candidates and voters

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.456
who have never had the opportunity
to participate or to vote

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.216
understand where, when, how to register;

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.456
where, when, how to vote;

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.000
why, why it is important to take part.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.016
So I'll probably devise a specific
campaign to reach out to women

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.056
to make sure that they can take part,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.376
that they can be part of the process.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.256
Young people as well.
