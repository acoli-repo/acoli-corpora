00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.480
in the Wolesi Jirga,
which is the parliamentary elections.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.216
And for the Provincial Council,
we had even more candidates.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800
We had 330 for 54 seats.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
So talking about ballot design,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.640
this is what the ballot looked like.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.216
It's the size of a newspaper.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:20.576
(Laughter)

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.960
Yeah, and --

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080
this was the Provincial Council ballot.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.696
Even more.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.656
So you see, we did use
a lot of symbols and things like that.
