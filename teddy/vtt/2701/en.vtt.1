00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.720
But what about countries
where democracy doesn't exist,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.056
countries where there are
no words to describe the concepts

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.520
that underpin a democratic society?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.856
I work in the field
of electoral assistance,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.016
so that's to say we assist

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.176
emerging democracies to organize

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080
what is often their first elections.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.896
When people ask me what I do,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.336
quite often I get this answer.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.176
"Oh, so you're one of these people
who goes around the world

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.120
imposing Western democracy
on countries that can't handle it."
