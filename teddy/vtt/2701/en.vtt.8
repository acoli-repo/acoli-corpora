00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.336
seven kilometers in the whole country,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.496
and that includes the tarmac
where we landed the planes

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.056
in Juba Airport.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.216
So transporting electoral materials, etc.,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.496
is exceedingly difficult.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.495
People had no idea
about what a box looked like.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.815
It was very complicated,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.936
so using verbal communication
was obviously the way to go,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
but there were 132 languages.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.720
So that was extremely challenging.
