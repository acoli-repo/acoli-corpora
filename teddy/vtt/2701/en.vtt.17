00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.135
And this newly formed Arab Organization
for Electoral Management Bodies,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.096
which is trying to professionalize

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.416
how elections are run in the region,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.535
they're using it as well.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:47.496
And the Arab League have now
built up a pan-Arab observation unit,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.776
and they're using it.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.416
So that's all really good.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.256
However, this work of reference
is quite high-pitched.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.176
It's complex, and a lot of the terms
are quite technical,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.360
so the average person probably doesn't
need to know at least a third of it.
