00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.256
Young people as well.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.496
All sorts of people.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.936
Handicapped people.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.560
We try to reach everybody.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.256
And it's not always easy,
because very often in this work,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.416
I've noticed now over the years
that I've been doing it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.856
that words are lacking,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520
and so what do you do?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.320
Afghanistan.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.696
It's a country with
high levels of illiteracy,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.576
and the thing about that was,
it was in 2005,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.576
and we organized two elections
on the same day.
