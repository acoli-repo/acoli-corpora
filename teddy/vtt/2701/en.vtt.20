that comes to us all the time.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.776
What we're not hearing is what are
the people, the everyday people, thinking?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.400
What are they aspiring to?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.880
Let's give them the means,
let's give them the words.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.696
The silent majority is silent

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.800
because they don't have the words.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.720
The silent majority needs to know.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.456
It is time to provide people
with the knowledge tools

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.720
that they can inform themselves with.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.056
The silent majority
does not need to be silent.
