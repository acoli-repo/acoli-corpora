00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.576
and we organized two elections
on the same day.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.816
The reason was because the logistics
are so incredibly difficult,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.096
it seemed to be more efficient to do that.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.336
It was,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.816
but on the other hand,
explaining two elections instead of one

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.336
was even more complicated.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.696
So we used a lot of images,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.520
and when it came to the actual ballot,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.456
we had problems, because
so many people wanted to take part,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.416
we had 300 candidates for 52 seats

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.480
in the Wolesi Jirga,
which is the parliamentary elections.
