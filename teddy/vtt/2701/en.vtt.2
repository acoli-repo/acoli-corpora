It really doesn't,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.216
and also, what we do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.536
is firmly anchored in the 1948
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.656

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.200

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.896
What does that mean? Another jargon.
