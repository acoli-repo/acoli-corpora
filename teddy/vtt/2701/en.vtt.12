00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.416
And with our colleagues,
we thought perhaps it's our role

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.496
to actually help make sure
that the words are understood

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.656
and actually create a work of reference

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.336
that could be used across the Arab region.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.616
And that's what we did.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.296
So together with these colleagues,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.296
we launched the "Arabic Lexicon
of Electoral Terminology,"

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.640
and we worked
in eight different countries.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.176
It meant actually defining 481 terms

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.056
which formed the basis
of everything you need to know
