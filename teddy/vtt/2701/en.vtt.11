It's very active, it's governed
by all kinds of treaties,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.816
and it has got
that control function in it.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.016
And then I got wind
of the fact that in Egypt,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.376
they were using this term "mutabi’,"
which means "to follow."

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.696
So we were now having
followers of an election.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.296
So that's not quite right either,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.082
because there is a term
that's already accepted and in use,

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:53.376
which was the word "muraqib"
which means "a controller."

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.536
It's got that notion of control.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.296
So I thought, three words
for one concept. This is not good.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.416
And with our colleagues,
we thought perhaps it's our role
