I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,

00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:04.120
because let's think about what happens

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.898
when we feel jealous.

00:04:05.898 --> 00:04:09.850
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.133
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.807
and these stories make us feel terrible

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:19.030
because they're designed to make us feel terrible.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.564
As the teller of the tale and the audience,

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:23.538
we know just what details to include,

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:27.107
to dig that knife in. Right?

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:30.462
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,
