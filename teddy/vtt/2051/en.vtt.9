Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,

00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:32.478
and this is something Proust understood.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:35.651
In the first volume, Swann's Way,

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.475
the series of books,

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:39.181
Swann, one of the main characters,

00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.409
is thinking very fondly of his mistress

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.101
and how great she is in bed,

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:47.143
and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,

00:04:47.143 --> 00:04:49.184
and these are Proustian sentences,

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.696
so they're long as rivers,

00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.959
but in the course of a few sentences,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.366
he suddenly recoils and he realizes,

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:58.649
"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.420
somebody else would love about this woman.
