00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.612
We forget how pitiless he is.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:33.933
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.269
were tough as cat gut.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.317
I don't know what cat gut is,

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:41.218
but let's assume it's formidable.

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:44.436
Let's look at why they go so well together,

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:48.114
the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:51.345
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.728
which boils down into person, desire, impediment,

00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:59.396
is such a solid narrative foundation?

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.071
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,
