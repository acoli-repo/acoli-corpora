Is she smiling too brightly here,

00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:03.851
or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.527
[Freud] says that the man is becoming

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:10.875
the custodian of his wife's unconscious.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.696
The novel is very good on this point.

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.504
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:19.488
trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:23.563
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,

00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:26.082
the more we become residents of fantasy.

00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:29.002
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't

00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:31.818
just provoke us to do violent things
