00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.972
Does any other emotion teach us to look

00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:34.164
with such peculiar intensity?

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:36.316
Freud would write about this later.

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:38.570
One day, Freud was visited

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.892
by this very anxious young man who was consumed

00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:43.395
with the thought of his wife cheating on him.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:45.472

The poor creature is just

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.885

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.694
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing

00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:58.194
without noticing, unintentional behaviors.

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:00.511
Is she smiling too brightly here,
