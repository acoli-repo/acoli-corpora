00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:01.965
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.999
when hang on, some of my other classmates

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.492
had appallingly good grades too.

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:10.540
So, in a frenzy,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.528
I corrected everybody's marks,

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.437
not imaginatively.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.951
I gave everybody a row of D's

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.752
and I gave myself a row of A's,

00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:22.552
just because I was there, you know, might as well.

00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:28.162
And I am still baffled by my behavior.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.574
I don't understand where the idea came from.
