00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:31.165
"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:34.524
We're proud of you."

00:11:34.524 --> 00:11:36.853
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard

00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:39.852
who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.

00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:42.237
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:44.332
in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:47.396
this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?

00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:49.309
It seems to treat jealousy

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:52.047
as a problem of geometry, not emotion.

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.913
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.836
The next minute they're on the same side.

00:11:56.836 --> 00:11:58.983
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself

00:11:58.983 --> 00:12:01.950
admire this mind that he's resented.
