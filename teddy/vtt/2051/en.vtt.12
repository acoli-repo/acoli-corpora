That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:04.897
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.339
When Swann is in his jealous throes,

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.510
and suddenly he's listening at doorways

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.533
and bribing his mistress' servants,

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:12.985
he defends these behaviors.

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.402
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,

00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:17.208
but it is no different

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:19.558
from interpreting an ancient text

00:06:19.558 --> 00:06:21.225
or looking at a monument."

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.822
He says, "They are scientific investigations

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.825
with real intellectual value."

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.937
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy

00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:31.828
feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,
