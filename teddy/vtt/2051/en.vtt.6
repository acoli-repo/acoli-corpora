00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.224
but in the case of jealousy,

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.965
he kind of does.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:08.951
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.952
and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.104
and just regular competitiveness, my brand,

00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:17.689
that we can hope to have. (Laughter)

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.116
And we think about Proust, we think

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.610
about the sentimental bits, right?

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.565
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:27.746
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:29.772
We forget how harsh his vision was.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.612
We forget how pitiless he is.
