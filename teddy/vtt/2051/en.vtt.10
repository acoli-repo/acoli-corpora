00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.420
somebody else would love about this woman.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.511
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.220
could be giving somebody else pleasure,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.498
maybe right about now."

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:12.282
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:14.145
and from then on, Proust writes that

00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:17.192
every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.856
he adds to his "collection of instruments

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:23.478
in his private torture chamber."

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:25.753
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,

00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:27.429
were notoriously jealous.

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:29.133
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:31.737
the country if they wanted to break up with him.
