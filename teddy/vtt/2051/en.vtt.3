00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.574
I don't understand where the idea came from.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:33.903
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.426

Jealousy baffles me.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.634

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.100
We know babies suffer from jealousy.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.750
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.270
We know that jealousy is the number one cause
