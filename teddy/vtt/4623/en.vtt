When I was 26 years old,
barely out of grad school,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.965
I was asked to come teach
a half-day class about motivation.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.055
I was excited for it.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.645
And then I found out my audience
would be generals and colonels

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.069
in the US Air Force.

00:00:15.812 --> 00:00:17.956
I was way underqualified.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.105
And I wanted to back out,
but it was too late.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:22.958
So I walked in,

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:26.347
and I was staring at a room
full of people twice my age,

00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.106
wearing full military garb
with all their medals on display.
