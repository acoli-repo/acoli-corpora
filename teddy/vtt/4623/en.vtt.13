RD: So that experience was the one
that really kind of, drove it home for me.

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:35.783
And I say, if you don't look back
on yourself and think,

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:38.791
"Wow, how stupid I was a year or two ago,"

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.712
then you must not have learned much
in the last year or two.

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:44.320
AG: Ray decided that the next
version of his company

00:06:44.344 --> 00:06:46.237
would have a different kind of culture

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:49.076
where everyone would be
brutally honest with each other.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.434
And that's what Bridgewater does today.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.725
Ray calls it radical transparency.

00:06:54.204 --> 00:06:57.815
Every criticism, every opinion,
out in the open.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.902
You're comfortable just putting that
out there, transparently?
