00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.624
Think about what happens
when you get criticized.

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.346
Like, physically: your shoulders tighten,
your breath gets shallower.

00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:39.204
Negative feedback sets off alarm bells.

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:41.277
It actually touches a nerve in your body.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:43.450
And psychologically?

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:44.847
Your mind races.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.211
You start to put up shields
and mount a counterattack.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:51.419
If you were a peacock, you'd strut.

00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:54.371
If you were an ape, you'd beat your chest.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.268
But humans have another kind of reaction.

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.459
There was a study a few decades ago

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:02.761
that said our ego can get
so defensive in these situations
