00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:33.582
At first, he was working
out of a barn with his friends.

00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:36.641
He got really successful really quickly.

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:38.648
And then he got cocky.

00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:40.799
He placed a bad bet.

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:42.188
It tanked his firm.

00:05:42.212 --> 00:05:43.776
He had to fire his friends.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.347
RD: And I was so broke

00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:49.569
that I had to borrow
4,000 dollars from my dad

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:51.319
to help pay for my family bills.

00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:54.879
And that was extremely painful.

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:56.969
It turned out to be terrific.

00:05:57.577 --> 00:06:01.125
AG: I'm sorry, you just said
it was terrific that is was so painful?
