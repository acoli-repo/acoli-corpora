00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:02.093
(Music)

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:04.310
Adam Grant: Hey, Kiran.
Kiran Rao: Hello, Adam.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.308
AG: How are you?
KR: Doing well, and you?

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:07.499
AG: Good.

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:08.722
This is Kiran Rao.

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:11.093
He used to be a manager
at a financial company.

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:14.839
Like most managers,
he spent a ton of time in meetings.

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:17.537
And most of them
were pretty run-of-the-mill.

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:20.513
But there's one meeting
that Kiran will never forget.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.284
Here's Kiran, breaking down
a recording of that meeting for us.

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:26.609
KR: We were in this large white tent,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:30.230
200 people sitting around,
the top 200 or 300 managers.
