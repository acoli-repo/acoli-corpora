00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.934
RD: If your objective is to be
as good as you can possibly be,

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.117
then you're going to want that.

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:10.276
AG: I think a lot of people
would rather maintain

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.537
at least the illusion of a decent image
than to actually improve.

00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:16.020
RD: But then they care
more about their image

00:11:16.044 --> 00:11:17.977
than they care about results.

00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:20.851
AG: And you're not willing
to tolerate that.

00:11:21.812 --> 00:11:24.256
RD: You know, life's much better
with good results.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.430
(Laughter)

00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:29.101
AG: The idea of criticizing
each other this openly

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:30.658
might sound terrifying.
