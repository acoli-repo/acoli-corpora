I study how to make work not suck.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.450
Organizations like Google,
the NBA and the Gates Foundation

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:38.958
have invited me in to help
make jobs more meaningful,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:41.783
teams more creative
and cultures more collaborative.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:46.553
In this show, I'm inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places,

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:50.626
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone else knew about work.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.410
Today, the art and science of criticism.

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:58.395
