00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:30.268
it's something
that's long been part of me.

00:08:30.292 --> 00:08:32.417
AG: Today, about 2,000 people work there

00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:36.854
and every single one of them is expected
to put criticism out in the open.

00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:39.821
Even if the billionaire founder
is the target.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.918
Here's an email Ray got one day
from a colleague named Jim Haskel.

00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:47.806
"Ray, you deserve a 'D-minus'
for your performance today.

00:08:48.323 --> 00:08:50.378
You rambled for 50 minutes.

00:08:50.768 --> 00:08:54.228
It was obvious to all of us
that you did not prepare at all.

00:08:54.553 --> 00:08:57.950
Today was really bad,
we can't let this happen again."

00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:03.069
When Jim sent his scathing review,
Ray decided to get a few more opinions.
