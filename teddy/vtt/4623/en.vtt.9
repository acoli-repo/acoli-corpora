00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.593
I've worked with hundreds of organizations

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:34.371
and I found only one
where that's truly the norm.

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:37.695
Ray Dalio: You could say to me,
"Hey, jerk, you're being an asshole."

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.869
And then we'll say, OK,
am I being an asshole?

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:41.869
AG: This is the guy in charge.

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:43.052
His name is Ray.

00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:45.273
RD: One of the biggest
tragedies of mankind

00:04:45.297 --> 00:04:48.759
is people holding in
their opinions in their heads,

00:04:48.783 --> 00:04:52.109
and it's such a tragedy
because it could so easily be fixed

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:53.783
if they put them out there

00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:55.958
and stress-tested them in the right way.

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:59.593
They would so raise their probability
of making a better decision.
