we should go and learn from the extreme.

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.578
You know, the same way you might try
and pick up a workout tip

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:05.942
from an Olympic athlete.

Bridgewater goes
to the extreme on criticism.

00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:12.173
They think you can learn
to dish it out and even crave it.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:16.474
Over the years, they've had some
high-profile senior leaders.

00:08:16.498 --> 00:08:19.402
Including James Comey,
the recent FBI director.

00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:23.465
He even talked about Bridgewater
at his Senate confirmation hearing.

00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:25.117
James Comey: I went to Bridgewater

00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:27.475
in part because of that culture
of transparency --

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:30.268
it's something
that's long been part of me.
