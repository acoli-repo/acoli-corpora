00:13:27.657 --> 00:13:30.816
saying something like that
is not radical candor,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.236
it's obnoxious aggression.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.735
AG: Kim Scott is an executive
coach in Silicon Valley.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.720
She works with CEOs and managers

00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:40.426
on being radically candid
in their feedback.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.577
KS: Be a kick-ass boss
without loosing your humanity.

00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:47.124
AG: I asked Kim how we can all
get better at providing criticism.

00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:48.329
And guess what.

00:13:48.353 --> 00:13:52.228
It's not about just blurting out whatever
pops into your head, like AJ did.

00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:54.273
KS: The idea of radical candor

00:13:54.297 --> 00:13:57.919
is that you're caring personally
about the other person

00:13:57.943 --> 00:14:00.767
at the same time that you're
challenging them directly.
