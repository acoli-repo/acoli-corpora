00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:30.230
200 people sitting around,
the top 200 or 300 managers.

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.207
Audio clip: Man: So the next two sections

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:34.315
are going to be
about practical application.

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.086
KR: We'd been talking
about multiple strategic points,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.315
and up comes a chart --

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.864
Audio clip: Man: This is a list

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:43.622
of forced-ranking the people
in this room by performance.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.371
KR: Which was labeled
"the worst managers."

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:48.585
Audio clip: Man: So these are
people we love.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.591
Some of the people in this room,
these names, probably shouldn't be here.

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.666
KR: And I was number one on the list.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.214
Audio clip: Man: I look at this name --
I hired Kiran.

00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:01.832
Apparently in his first couple years,
he's not doing that well.
