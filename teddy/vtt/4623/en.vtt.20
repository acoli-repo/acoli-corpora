00:09:57.585 --> 00:10:00.188
But there's another kind
of network that we all need:

00:10:00.212 --> 00:10:01.546
a challenge network.

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:06.347
A challenge network is the group of people
that you trust to push you to get better.

00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:10.291
They tell you the stuff you don't want
to hear but need to hear.

00:10:10.688 --> 00:10:13.672
And Bridgewater
is one big challenge network.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.950
RD: I want Jim's critiques.

00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:18.807
Because I might be inclined to ramble,

00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:22.149
and because I might be inclined
to not be prepared.

00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:25.601
AG: So Ray made a promise to Jim:
he'd do better the next time.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.188
RD: He said, "Listen,
I can't trust you to do that.

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.918
And I say, "Great, I can't trust me
to do that, either."
