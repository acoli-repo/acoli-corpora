00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:30.658
might sound terrifying.

00:11:31.117 --> 00:11:32.267
I get that.

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:35.649
In lots of workplaces,
it would be painful at best

00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:37.073
and abusive at worst.

00:11:37.474 --> 00:11:40.140
There's a bunch of work by economists

00:11:40.164 --> 00:11:43.449
showing that rankings
generally demotivate people.

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:45.371
People, even at the top, are like,

00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:47.251
"I expected to be further at the top."

00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:49.896
And everybody at the bottom
doesn't enjoy the experience

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.928
of comparing themselves negatively
to everyone else around them.

00:11:52.952 --> 00:11:59.102
RD: In normal companies,
I suspect that they don't prepare people,

00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:02.254
agree on it, say, "Is this a good thing?"
