00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:04.349
It felt like a punch in the stomach.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.211
And I couldn't get it out of my head.

00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:12.236
So I did what any self-respecting
organizational psychologist would do:

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.102
I started studying why it's often
soul-crushing to receive criticism.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.631
And whether we could
actually learn to like it.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:26.044

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:27.537
