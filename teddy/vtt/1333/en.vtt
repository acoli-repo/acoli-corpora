00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.161
As humans, it's in our nature

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.455
to want to improve our health 
and minimize our suffering.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.122
Whatever life throws at us,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.587
whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:12.779
or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.262
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.002
and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.470
have used materials in really creative ways

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.214
in the body over time.

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.860
Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.742
This was actually used by the Mayans

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:32.281
as an artificial tooth replacement.
