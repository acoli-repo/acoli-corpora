Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:14.540
that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.783
Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion?

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.482
Or maybe you've been in an argument


00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.640
when the other person suddenly accuses you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.507
of not listening 
to what they're saying at all?

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:27.950
What's going on here?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.017
The answer is miscommunication,
