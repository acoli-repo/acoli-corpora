Along the Nile River, 
in what is now northern Sudan,

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:13.538
lay the ancient civilization of Kush.

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:16.538
Though they were once conquered
by a powerful neighbor,

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:21.413
the kings and queens of Kush would 
go on to successfully challenge

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:24.288
two of the most dominant empires 
in history.

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:29.413
From 1500 to 1100 BCE, 
Egypt controlled Kush,

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:33.204
introducing many Egyptian 
cultural and religious practices.
