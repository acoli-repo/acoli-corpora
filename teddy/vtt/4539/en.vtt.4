"It was awesome.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.251
And you had a big sign
promoting Shinerama," --

which is Students Fighting
Cystic Fibrosis,

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:07.193
a charity I've worked with for years --

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.037
"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:11.564
You were handing the lollipops out
to people in line,

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:12.931

All of the sudden, you got to me,
and you just stopped.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.262
And you stared. It was creepy."

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.692

00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:22.718
(Laughter)

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.374
"Then you looked at the guy next to me,
smiled, reached into your bucket,

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.854
pulled out a lollipop,
held it out to him and said,

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:32.020
'You need to give a lollipop
to the beautiful woman next to you.'"
