00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:00.377
was a moment that I didn't even remember.

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.460
How many of you guys
have a lollipop moment,

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:04.554
a moment where someone
said or did something

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.066
that you feel fundamentally
made your life better?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.027
All right. How many of you have told
that person they did it?

00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:11.644
See, why not?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.819
We celebrate birthdays,

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:15.514
where all you have to do
is not die for 365 days --

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:16.695
(Laughter)

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.008
Yet we let people
who have made our lives better

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:20.516
walk around without knowing it.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.055
Every single one of you
has been the catalyst

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.230
for a lollipop moment.

00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:27.271
You've made someone's life better
by something you said or did.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:28.490
If you think you haven't,

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.046
think of all the hands
that didn't go up when I asked.
