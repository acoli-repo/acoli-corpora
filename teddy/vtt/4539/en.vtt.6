00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:01.324
Twenty feet in every direction,
everyone started to howl.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.463
I know this is cheesy, and I don't know
why I'm telling you this,

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:07.909
but in that moment when everyone
was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:10.765
I knew I was where I was supposed
to be; I knew I was home.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.122
And I haven't spoken to you
once in the four years since that day.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.228
But I heard that you were leaving,
and I had to come and tell you

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:19.829
you've been an incredibly
important person in my life.

00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:21.652
I'm going to miss you. Good luck."

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:23.726
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.331
She gets six feet away,
turns around, smiles and goes,

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.098
"You should probably know this, too:

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.305
I'm still dating that guy,
four years later."
