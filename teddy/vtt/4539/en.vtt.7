00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.305
I'm still dating that guy,
four years later."

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.474
(Laughter)

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:33.980
A year and a half
after I moved to Toronto,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.881
I got an invitation to their wedding.

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:36.912
(Laughter)

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.468
Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.845
I have no recollection of that moment.

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.315
I've searched my memory banks,

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.510
because that is funny and I should
remember doing it and I don't.

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:49.317
That was such an eye-opening,
transformative moment for me,

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.634
to think that maybe the biggest impact
I'd ever had on anyone's life,

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:56.147
a moment that had a woman walk up
to a stranger four years later and say,

00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.327
"You've been an important
person in my life,"

00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:00.377
was a moment that I didn't even remember.
