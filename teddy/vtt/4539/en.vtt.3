They were like, "We know you're scared,
but let's just go tomorrow,

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:34.631
go to the first day, and if at any point
you feel as if you can't do this,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.814
that's fine; tell us,
and we'll take you home.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:38.235
We love you no matter what.'"

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.886

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:50.168
an incredible feeling
of peace came over me.

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:53.270
I turned to my mom and dad
to tell them we needed to go home,

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:56.207
and at that moment, you came
out of the student union building

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.722
wearing the stupidest hat
I've ever seen in my life."

00:01:58.746 --> 00:01:59.747

00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:01.022
"It was awesome.
