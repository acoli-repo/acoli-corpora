WEBVTT

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:32.848
means a level of arrogance or cockiness
that we're not comfortable with.

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:35.395
And I worry sometimes
that we spend so much time

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.252

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.434
With my short time today,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:02.129
I want to share with you the one story
that is probably most responsible
