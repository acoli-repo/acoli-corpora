I want to share with you the one story
that is probably most responsible

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:03.316
for that redefinition.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.309
I went to a little school

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.147
called Mount Allison University
in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.830
And on my last day there,
a girl came up to me and said,

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:12.996
"I remember the first time I met you."

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.146

that had happened four years earlier.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.505

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:20.593
I was in the hotel room
with my mom and dad,

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.487
and I was so scared
and so convinced that I couldn't do this,

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.571
that I wasn't ready for university,
that I just burst into tears.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:27.936
My mom and dad were amazing.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.122
They were like, "We know you're scared,
but let's just go tomorrow,
