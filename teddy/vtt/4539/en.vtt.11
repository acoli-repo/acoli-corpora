There's only six billion
understandings of it.

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.063
And if you change
one person's understanding of it,

00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:36.116
understanding of what they're capable of,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.449
understanding of how much
people care about them,

00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:41.075
understanding of how powerful
an agent for change

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.473
they can be in this world,

00:05:42.497 --> 00:05:43.992
you've changed the whole thing.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:46.539
And if we can understand
leadership like that,

00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:49.074
I think if we can redefine
leadership like that,

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.947
I think we can change everything.

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.741
And it's a simple idea,
but I don't think it's a small one.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.937
I want to thank you so much
for letting me share it with you today.
