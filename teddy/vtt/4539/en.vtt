00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:02.913
I wanted to just start
by asking everyone a question:

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.183
How many of you are completely comfortable

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:06.961
with calling yourselves a leader?

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:10.558
I've asked that question
all across the country,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:12.559
and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:16.116
there's a huge portion of the audience
that won't put up their hand.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.636
And I've come to realize
that we have made leadership

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.070
into something bigger than us;
something beyond us.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:22.967
We've made it about changing the world.

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.626
We've taken this title of "leader"

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.578
and treat it as something
that one day we're going to deserve.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.389
But to give it to ourselves right now

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:32.848
means a level of arrogance or cockiness
that we're not comfortable with.
