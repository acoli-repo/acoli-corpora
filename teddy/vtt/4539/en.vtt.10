00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.293
My call to action today
is that we need to get over our fear

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.319
of how extraordinarily powerful
we can be in each other's lives.

00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:06.597
We need to get over it
so we can move beyond it,

00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:09.391
and our little brothers and sisters
and one day our kids --

00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.898
or our kids right now --
can watch and start to value

00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:14.072
the impact we can have
on each other's lives,

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:16.682
more than money and power
and titles and influence.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.848
We need to redefine leadership
as being about lollipop moments --

00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:22.402
how many of them we create,
how many we acknowledge,

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:25.613
how many of them we pay forward
and how many we say thank you for.

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:28.257
Because we've made leadership
about changing the world,

00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:29.441
and there is no world.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.624
There's only six billion
understandings of it.
