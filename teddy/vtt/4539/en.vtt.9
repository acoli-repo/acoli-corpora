00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.046
think of all the hands
that didn't go up when I asked.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.459
You're just one of the people
who hasn't been told.

00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:35.819
It's scary to think of ourselves
as that powerful,

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.731
frightening to think we can matter
that much to other people.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.422
As long as we make leadership
something bigger than us,

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.362
as long as we keep leadership beyond us

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:45.158
and make it about changing the world,

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.769
we give ourselves an excuse
not to expect it every day,

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:49.702
from ourselves and from each other.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:53.309
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest
fear is not that we are inadequate.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.400
[It] is that we are powerful
beyond measure.

00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:58.077
It is our light and not our darkness
that frightens us."

00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.293
My call to action today
is that we need to get over our fear
