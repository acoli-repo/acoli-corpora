Dear Abuelita,

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.357
I know I haven't been home for a while.

00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:07.688
You are in our lovely home in Mexico,

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:10.061
and I'm here in the US,

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:11.458
fighting for our future.

00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:14.299
You're probably watering the roses,

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:16.171
taking care of the peaches

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:18.995
and making sure your turtles are well-fed.

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:22.259
That's one of the things
I miss the most about home --

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:24.267
spending time with the flowers

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.773
while you tell me stories
about your childhood.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.988
As you know, we have been living
in New York City since 2015.
