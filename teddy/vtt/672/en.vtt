00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:02.492
Take a minute

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:05.326
and think of yourself
as the leader of a country.

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.325
And let's say one
of your biggest priorities

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.081
is to provide your citizens
with high-quality healthcare.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.928
How would you go about it?

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:17.809
Build more hospitals?

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.904
Open more medical colleges?

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:21.928
Invest in clinical innovation?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.607
But what if your country's health system
was fundamentally broken?

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.679
Whether it's doctor absenteeism,

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:32.718
drug stock-outs or poor quality of care.
