00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:09.505
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica,

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:13.051
children flock to Mr. Kwaku for a story.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:17.805
They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors.

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:20.683
But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks,

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:24.145
is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:29.817
Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God.
