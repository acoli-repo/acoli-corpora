You can't ask them to repeat
every single word.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.476
They would just get frustrated with you.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.240
So without even realizing it,

00:07:38.264 --> 00:07:43.176
my solution was to take
the muffled sound I heard,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.352
that was the beat,

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:48.886
and turn it into a rhythm
and place it with the lips I read.

00:07:49.908 --> 00:07:55.581
Years later, someone commented
that my writing had a rhythm to it.

00:07:56.105 --> 00:08:01.066
Well, this is because I experience
conversations as rhythms.
