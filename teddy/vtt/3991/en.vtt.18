But what my coach, and what I
didn't even know at the time,

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:09.723
was that my hearing loss
actually helped me excel at sports.

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:15.771
You see, when you lose your hearing,
not only do you adapt your behavior,

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.577
but you also adapt your physical senses.

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.435
One example of this

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:26.962
is that my visual
attention span increased.

00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:32.001
Imagine a soccer player,
coming down the left flank.
