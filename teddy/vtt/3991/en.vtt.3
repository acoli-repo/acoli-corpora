00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.266
because I was asked to work
on the UN Convention

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.593
that protects people with disabilities.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.391
As the leader of the NGO there,

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:41.073
I spent most of my energy
trying to convince people

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:44.341
about the capabilities
of people with disabilities.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.260
But somewhere along the way,

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:51.087
and after many career transitions

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.158

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:54.768
(Laughter)

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.899
I stumbled upon a solution

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:03.283
that I believe may be
an even more powerful tool
