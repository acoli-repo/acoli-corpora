00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.472
So as you can see,

00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:05.162
I've been a design thinker
for nearly all my life.

00:10:06.788 --> 00:10:11.346
My observation skills have been honed
so that I pick up on things

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.353
that others would never pick up on.

00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:19.197
My constant need to adapt
has made me a great ideator

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.538
and problem solver.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:25.664
And I've often had to do this
within limitations and constraints.

00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:30.439
This is something that designers
also have to deal with frequently.
