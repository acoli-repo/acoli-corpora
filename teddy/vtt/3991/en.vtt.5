00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:34.497
The second is observing people
in real-life situations

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.821
and empathizing with them.

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.815
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --
the more the better,

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.373
the wilder the better.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.720
Fourth, prototyping:
gathering whatever you can,

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.196
whatever you can find,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.819
to mimic your solution, to test it

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.275
and to refine it.

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.409
And finally, implementation:

00:02:56.433 --> 00:03:01.491
ensuring that the solution
you came up with is sustainable.
