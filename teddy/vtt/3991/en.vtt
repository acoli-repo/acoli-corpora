00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:03.501
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.587
of laughing with my friends.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.796
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.275
of my mother's voice
right before I fell asleep.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:18.689
And I'll never forget
the comforting sound of water

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:20.731
trickling down a stream.

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:25.969
Imagine my fear, pure fear,

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.386
when, at the age of 10,

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:31.569
I was told I was going to lose my hearing.
