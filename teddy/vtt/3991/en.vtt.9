00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:31.268
So I decided,

00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:33.323
why not try and solve it?

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.847
My solution was a pair of safety glasses

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.663
that were engineered
to visually alert the user

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:44.279
to pitch changes in the tool,

00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:47.175
before the human ear could pick it up.

00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:52.668
Why hadn't tool designers
thought of this before?

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.595
(Laughter)

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:58.410
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:03.411
I wasn't weighed down by expertise
or conventional wisdom.
