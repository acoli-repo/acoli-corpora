00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.518
Talk about this.

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:34.518
NB: Yeah, so in addition to these
kind of obvious types of black balls

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.352
that would just make it possible
to blow up a lot of things,

00:05:37.376 --> 00:05:41.809
other types would act
by creating bad incentives

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:44.059
for humans to do things that are harmful.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:48.184
So, the Type-2a, we might call it that,

00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:52.726
is to think about some technology
that incentivizes great powers

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.226
to use their massive amounts of force
to create destruction.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.083
So, nuclear weapons were actually
very close to this, right?
