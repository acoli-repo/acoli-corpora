00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.559
but you don't want it
to get too easy either,

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:03.059
you don't want any random person
and his grandmother

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:06.143
to have the ability to radically
alter the earth's climate.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:09.726
Or maybe lethal autonomous drones,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.083
massed-produced, mosquito-sized
killer bot swarms.

CA: You argue in the paper

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.476
that it's a matter of luck
that when we discovered

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.934
that nuclear power could create a bomb,

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.351
it might have been the case

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.226
that you could have created a bomb

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.809
with much easier resources,
accessible to anyone.
