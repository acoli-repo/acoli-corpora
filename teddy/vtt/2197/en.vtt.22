00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:00.018
but we can also invent technologies
that kind of help us control

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.059
how people use those powers.

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.934
CA: So let's talk about that,
let's talk about the response.

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.268
Suppose that thinking
about all the possibilities

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.393
that are out there now --

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:13.143
it's not just synbio,
it's things like cyberwarfare,

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:16.518
artificial intelligence, etc., etc. --

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:21.059
that there might be
serious doom in our future.

00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:22.684
What are the possible responses?

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:27.601
And you've talked about
four possible responses as well.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:31.268
NB: Restricting technological development
doesn't seem promising,
