00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.083
So, nuclear weapons were actually
very close to this, right?

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:05.143
What we did, we spent
over 10 trillion dollars

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:07.684
to build 70,000 nuclear warheads

00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:10.143
and put them on hair-trigger alert.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.434
And there were several times
during the Cold War

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:13.893
we almost blew each other up.

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:17.018
It's not because a lot of people felt
this would be a great idea,

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:19.726
let's all spend 10 trillion dollars
to blow ourselves up,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.684
but the incentives were such
that we were finding ourselves --

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.018
this could have been worse.

00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:26.476
Imagine if there had been
a safe first strike.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.809
Then it might have been very tricky,

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.101
in a crisis situation,
