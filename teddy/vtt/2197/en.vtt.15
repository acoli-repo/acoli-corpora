00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.226
if you emit a certain amount
of greenhouse gases.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.643
But, suppose that it had been the case

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:35.184
that with the amount
of greenhouse gases we emitted,

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:37.268
instead of the temperature rising by, say,

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:41.018
between three and 4.5 degrees by 2100,

00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:43.542
suppose it had been
15 degrees or 20 degrees.

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:46.934
Like, then we might have been
in a very bad situation.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.101
Or suppose that renewable energy
had just been a lot harder to do.

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:52.768
Or that there had been
more fossil fuels in the ground.

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:55.434
CA: Couldn't you argue
that if in that case of --

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.184
if what we are doing today

00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:01.768
had resulted in 10 degrees difference
in the time period that we could see,
