Chris Anderson: Nick Bostrom.

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.809
So, you have already given us
so many crazy ideas out there.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.559
I think a couple of decades ago,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.518
you made the case that we might
all be living in a simulation,

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.351
or perhaps probably were.

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:14.726
More recently,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.351
you've painted the most vivid examples
of how artificial general intelligence

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.208
could go horribly wrong.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.143
And now this year,

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.393
you're about to publish

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:29.351
a paper that presents something called
the vulnerable world hypothesis.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.958
And our job this evening is to
give the illustrated guide to that.
