I just wonder whether the logic isn't
that we, as a matter of global priority,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.684
we shouldn't go out there and try,

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:06.393
like, now start negotiating
really strict rules

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:09.101
on where synthetic bioresearch is done,

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.976
that it's not something
that you want to democratize, no?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.809
NB: I totally agree with that --

00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:18.059
that it would be desirable, for example,

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:21.684
maybe to have DNA synthesis machines,

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:25.268
not as a product where each lab
has their own device,

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:26.768
but maybe as a service.

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:29.309
Maybe there could be
four or five places in the world

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:32.851
where you send in your digital blueprint
and the DNA comes back, right?
