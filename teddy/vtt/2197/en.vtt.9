00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.518
that if it was possible to create
massive nuclear reactions relatively easy,

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.400
the Earth would never have been stable,

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:34.976
that we wouldn't be here at all.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.393
NB: Yeah, unless there were something
that is easy to do on purpose

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:41.268
but that wouldn't happen by random chance.

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:42.871
So, like things we can easily do,

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:45.006
we can stack 10 blocks
on top of one another,

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.228
but in nature, you're not going to find,
like, a stack of 10 blocks.

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.926
CA: OK, so this is probably the one

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.893
that many of us worry about most,

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.434
and yes, synthetic biology
is perhaps the quickest route

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:58.476
that we can foresee
in our near future to get us here.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.434
NB: Yeah, and so think
about what that would have meant
