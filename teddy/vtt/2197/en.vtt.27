00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:32.851
where you send in your digital blueprint
and the DNA comes back, right?

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.643
And then, you would have the ability,

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:37.059
if one day it really looked
like it was necessary,

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.434
we would have like,
a finite set of choke points.

00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:42.976
So I think you want to look
for kind of special opportunities,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.059
where you could have tighter control.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.726
CA: Your belief is, fundamentally,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.643
we are not going to be successful
in just holding back.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:52.393
Someone, somewhere --
North Korea, you know --

00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:55.934
someone is going to go there
and discover this knowledge,

00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.226
if it's there to be found.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.601
NB: That looks plausible
under current conditions.

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.559
It's not just synthetic biology, either.
