00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.893
CA: So once it's out, it's out,
and you can't put it back in,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.434
and you think we've been lucky.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.684
So talk through a couple
of these examples.

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:37.809
You talk about different
types of vulnerability.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.268
NB: So the easiest type to understand

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:43.434
is a technology
that just makes it very easy

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.583
to cause massive amounts of destruction.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.893
Synthetic biology might be a fecund
source of that kind of black ball,

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:53.601
but many other possible things we could --

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.143
think of geoengineering,
really great, right?

00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:58.393
We could combat global warming,

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.559
but you don't want it
to get too easy either,
