00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.309
NB: Well, I guess
it's just meant to illustrate

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.434
the difficulty of foreseeing

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.143
what basic discoveries will lead to.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.226
We just don't have that capability.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.601
Because we have become quite good
at pulling out balls,

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:18.351
but we don't really have the ability
to put the ball back into the urn, right.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:20.542
We can invent, but we can't un-invent.

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:24.351
So our strategy, such as it is,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.809
is to hope that there is
no black ball in the urn.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.893
CA: So once it's out, it's out,
and you can't put it back in,
