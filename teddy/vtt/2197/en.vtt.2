You can think of the history
of human creativity

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:08.393
as the process of reaching into this urn
and pulling out one ball after another,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:11.643
and the net effect so far
has been hugely beneficial, right?

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:14.393
We've extracted a great many white balls,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.292
some various shades of gray,
mixed blessings.

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:21.000
We haven't so far
pulled out the black ball --

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:27.768
a technology that invariably destroys
the civilization that discovers it.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:31.059
So the paper tries to think
about what could such a black ball be.
