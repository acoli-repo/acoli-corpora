00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:30.768
to a world where you could have
a DNA printer in every home

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.125
and high school lab.

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.851
There are some restrictions, right?

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.518
NB: Possibly, there is
the first part, the not feasible.

00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:39.726
If you think it would be
desirable to stop it,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.476
there's the problem of feasibility.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.309
So it doesn't really help
if one nation kind of --

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:46.351
CA: No, it doesn't help
if one nation does,

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:49.309
but we've had treaties before.

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:52.684
That's really how we survived
the nuclear threat,

00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:53.976
was by going out there

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.518
and going through
the painful process of negotiating.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:13:01.976
I just wonder whether the logic isn't
that we, as a matter of global priority,
