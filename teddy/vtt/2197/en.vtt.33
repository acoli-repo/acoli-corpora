00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.643
There are huge problems and risks
with that, right?

00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:32.934
We may come back to that.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.226
So the other, the final,

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.809
the other general stabilization capability

00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:38.893
is kind of plugging
another governance gap.

00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:43.101
So the surveillance would be kind of
governance gap at the microlevel,

00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:46.226
like, preventing anybody
from ever doing something highly illegal.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.559
Then, there's a corresponding
governance gap

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:50.518
at the macro level, at the global level.

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:54.476
You would need the ability, reliably,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.309
to prevent the worst kinds
of global coordination failures,

00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:01.101
to avoid wars between great powers,
