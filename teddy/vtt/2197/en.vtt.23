NB: Restricting technological development
doesn't seem promising,

00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.518
if we are talking about a general halt
to technological progress.

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:35.809
I think neither feasible,

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:38.143
nor would it be desirable
even if we could do it.

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:41.184
I think there might be very limited areas

00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:43.934
where maybe you would want
slower technological progress.

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.351
You don't, I think, want
faster progress in bioweapons,

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:49.434
or in, say, isotope separation,

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.708
that would make it easier to create nukes.

00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:55.893
CA: I mean, I used to be
fully on board with that.

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:59.184
But I would like to actually
push back on that for a minute.

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:00.518
Just because, first of all,
