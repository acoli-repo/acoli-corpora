00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:01.768
had resulted in 10 degrees difference
in the time period that we could see,

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:05.476
actually humanity would have got
off its ass and done something about it.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.309
We're stupid, but we're not
maybe that stupid.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:09.601
Or maybe we are.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.893
NB: I wouldn't bet on it.

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:13.101
(Laughter)

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.809
You could imagine other features.

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:20.351
So, right now, it's a little bit difficult
to switch to renewables and stuff, right,

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.643
but it can be done.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.643
But it might just have been,
with slightly different physics,

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.458
it could have been much more expensive
to do these things.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:29.893
CA: And what's your view, Nick?

00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:32.351
Do you think, putting
these possibilities together,
