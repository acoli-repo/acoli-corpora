00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:31.059
So the paper tries to think
about what could such a black ball be.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.893
CA: So you define that ball

00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:36.601
as one that would inevitably
bring about civilizational destruction.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:41.934
NB: Unless we exit what I call
the semi-anarchic default condition.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.458
But sort of, by default.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.851
CA: So, you make the case compelling

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.893
by showing some sort of counterexamples

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:52.851
where you believe that so far
we've actually got lucky,

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.726
that we might have pulled out
that death ball

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.309
without even knowing it.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.625
So there's this quote, what's this quote?
