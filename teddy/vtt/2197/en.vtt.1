00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.958
And our job this evening is to
give the illustrated guide to that.

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.250
So let's do that.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.625
What is that hypothesis?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.434
Nick Bostrom: It's trying to think about

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:45.542
a sort of structural feature
of the current human condition.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.476
You like the urn metaphor,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.393
so I'm going to use that to explain it.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.768
So picture a big urn filled with balls

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:59.750
representing ideas, methods,
possible technologies.
