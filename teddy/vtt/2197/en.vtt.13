00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.101
in a crisis situation,

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.602
to refrain from launching
all their nuclear missiles.

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:36.018
If nothing else, because you would fear
that the other side might do it.

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.851
CA: Right, mutual assured destruction

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.601
kept the Cold War relatively stable,

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:42.559
without that, we might not be here now.

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:44.893
NB: It could have been
more unstable than it was.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.268
And there could be
other properties of technology.

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.601
It could have been harder
to have arms treaties,

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.226
if instead of nuclear weapons

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.268
there had been some smaller thing
or something less distinctive.

00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:56.851
CA: And as well as bad incentives
for powerful actors,

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.393
you also worry about bad incentives
for all of us, in Type-2b here.
