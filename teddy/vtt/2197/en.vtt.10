00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.434
NB: Yeah, and so think
about what that would have meant

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:05.101
if, say, anybody by working
in their kitchen for an afternoon

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:06.518
could destroy a city.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:10.101
It's hard to see how
modern civilization as we know it

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.559
could have survived that.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:14.101
Because in any population
of a million people,

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.809
there will always be some
who would, for whatever reason,

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:18.917
choose to use that destructive power.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.893
So if that apocalyptic residual

00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:24.893
would choose to destroy a city, or worse,

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:26.476
then cities would get destroyed.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.851
CA: So here's another type
of vulnerability.

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.518
Talk about this.
