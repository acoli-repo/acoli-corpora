00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:30.059
that technology inherently accelerates,

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.518
that we build the tools
that make us more powerful,

00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.184
then at some point you get to a stage

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:38.268
where a single individual
can take us all down,

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:41.143
and then it looks like we're screwed.

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:44.101
Isn't that argument quite alarming?

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:45.875
NB: Ah, yeah.

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:47.976
(Laughter)

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.333
I think --

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.476
Yeah, we get more and more power,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.434
and [it's] easier and easier 
to use those powers,

00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:00.018
but we can also invent technologies
that kind of help us control
