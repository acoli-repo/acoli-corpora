00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.809
with much easier resources,
accessible to anyone.

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.393
NB: Yeah, so think back to the 1930s

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:40.018
where for the first time we make
some breakthroughs in nuclear physics,

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:43.726
some genius figures out that it's possible
to create a nuclear chain reaction

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.934
and then realizes
that this could lead to the bomb.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.851
And we do some more work,

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.601
it turns out that what you require
to make a nuclear bomb

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.018
is highly enriched uranium or plutonium,

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:56.059
which are very difficult materials to get.

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.351
You need ultracentrifuges,

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.143
you need reactors, like,
massive amounts of energy.
