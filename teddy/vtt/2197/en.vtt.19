00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:32.042
like, eventually we will
pull out all the balls.

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:36.268
I mean, I think there's a kind
of weak form of technological determinism

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:37.559
that is quite plausible,

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:40.226
like, you're unlikely
to encounter a society

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.083
that uses flint axes and jet planes.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:48.268
But you can almost think
of a technology as a set of affordances.

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:51.309
So technology is the thing
that enables us to do various things

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.309
and achieve various effects in the world.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:56.143
How we'd then use that,
of course depends on human choice.

00:09:56.167 --> 00:09:58.851
But if we think about these
three types of vulnerability,

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:02.268
they make quite weak assumptions
about how we would choose to use them.
