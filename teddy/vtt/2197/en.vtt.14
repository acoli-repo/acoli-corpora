00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.393
you also worry about bad incentives
for all of us, in Type-2b here.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:04.667
NB: Yeah, so, here we might
take the case of global warming.

00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.851
There are a lot of little conveniences

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:11.059
that cause each one of us to do things

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.934
that individually 
have no significant effect, right?

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.934
But if billions of people do it,

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.018
cumulatively, it has a damaging effect.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.851
Now, global warming
could have been a lot worse than it is.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.851
So we have the climate
sensitivity parameter, right.

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:27.518
It's a parameter that says
how much warmer does it get

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.226
if you emit a certain amount
of greenhouse gases.
