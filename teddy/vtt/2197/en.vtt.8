00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.143
you need reactors, like,
massive amounts of energy.

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:03.976
But suppose it had turned out instead

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.976
there had been an easy way
to unlock the energy of the atom.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.768
That maybe by baking sand
in the microwave oven

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.059
or something like that

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:14.184
you could have created
a nuclear detonation.

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.351
So we know that that's
physically impossible.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.268
But before you did the relevant physics

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:20.483
how could you have known
how it would turn out?

00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.059
CA: Although, couldn't you argue

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:24.018
that for life to evolve on Earth

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:27.309
that implied sort of stable environment,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.518
that if it was possible to create
massive nuclear reactions relatively easy,
