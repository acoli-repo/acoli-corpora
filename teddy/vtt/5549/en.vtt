00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.885
Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe,

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.066
but we can still measure its speed

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.895
if we slow down the animation,

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.805
we can analyze light's motion using

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.739
a space-time diagram,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.839
which takes a flipbook of animation panels,

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.973
and turns them on their side.

00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:25.080
In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.977
that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves,

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.329
they get the same answer:

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.281
299,792,458 meters every second,
