00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.536
So you're really going to see
an extreme segregation going on

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.896
between the winners
and the losers across Africa.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.816
Finally, back to the United States.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.456
What do I think about us?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.216
Because there are a lot of upset people,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.896
not here at TEDx, I know,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.696
but in the United States, my God,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.176
after 15 months of campaigning,
we should be upset.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.176
I understand that.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.456
But a lot of people are upset
because they say, "Washington's broken,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.976
we don't trust the establishment,
we hate the media."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.136
Heck, even globalists like me
are taking it on the chin.
