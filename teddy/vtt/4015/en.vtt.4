00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.920
along with all the media
and everybody else.

Later on in the G20,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440
well, there's Obama.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.696

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.336
Hi, George.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.560
Hi, Norman.

That's what Putin wanted to talk about.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.016
He's increasingly calling the shots.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.656
He's the one willing to do stuff there.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.856
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.736
but it's not as if the Americans
are telling him what to do.
