00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.256
Number two, it was easy to take
a lot of cheap money out of the ground

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.056
because oil was expensive.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.416
And number three

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.536
was no matter how bad the leaders were,
the populations were relatively quiescent.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.336
They didn't have the ability,
and many didn't have the will

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.816
to really rise up against.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.376
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.016
all three of those things
are increasingly not true,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.376
and so failed states,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.616
terrorism, refugees and the rest.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.576
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.456
No, the Kurds will do better,
and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
