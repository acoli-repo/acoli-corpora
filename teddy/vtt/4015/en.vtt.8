WEBVTT

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.416
because the United States,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.256
we spent two trillion dollars
on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.496
that were failed.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.136
We don't want to do that anymore.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.816
We have large numbers
of middle and working classes

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.936
that feel like they've not benefited
from promises of globalization,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.000
so they don't want to see it particularly.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.296
And we have an energy revolution

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.496
where we don't need OPEC
or the Middle East the way we used to.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.976
We produce all that right here
in the United States.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.336
So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security
