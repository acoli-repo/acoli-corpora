So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.656
or the architect of global trade.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.096
The Americans don't want to even be
the cheerleader of global values.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.776
Well, then you look to Europe,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.896
and the most important
alliance in the world

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.656
has been the transatlantic relationship.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.056
But it is now weaker than it has been
at any point since World War II,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.656
all of the crises,
the Brexit conversations,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.776
the hedging going on
between the French and the Russians,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
or the Germans and the Turks,
or the Brits and the Chinese.
