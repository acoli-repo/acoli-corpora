00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.016
A lot of people in that context say,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.536
"Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.616
Let's send our kids
to American universities."

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.776
You know, our neighbors are awesome:

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.656
Canada, Mexico

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.696
Terrorism is a problem

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.016
God knows we know it here in New York.
