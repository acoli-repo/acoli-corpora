When you come to TEDx,
you always think about technology,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.656
the world changing,
becoming more innovative.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.456
You think about the driverless.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.896
Everyone's talking
about driverless cars these days,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.016
and I love the concept
of a driverless car,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.536
but when I go in one, you know,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.480
I want it really slow,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.720
I want access to the steering wheel
and the brake, just in case.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.240
I don't know about you,
but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
