We will see it in Brazil

that is moving in another direction

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.416
is the unpopularity
of Mexican president Peña Nieto.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.296

a slip away from the United States

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.576
over the coming years.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.616
The US election matters a lot

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.960
(Laughter)

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.416
Africa, right?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.656
A lot of people have said
it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.216
In a G-Zero world,
it is absolutely an amazing time
