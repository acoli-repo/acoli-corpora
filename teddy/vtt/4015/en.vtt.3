00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.576
President Obama has got the red carpet,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.416
he goes down Air Force One,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.976
and it feels pretty good,
it feels pretty comfortable.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.616
Well, I don't know how many of you
saw the China trip last week

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.696
and the G20.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.936
Oh my God. Right?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.616
This is how we landed

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.136
for the most important meeting
of the world's leaders in China.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.136
The National Security Advisor
was actually spewing expletives

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.976
on the tarmac --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.416
no red carpet,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.096
kind of left out the bottom of the plane

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.920
along with all the media
and everybody else.
