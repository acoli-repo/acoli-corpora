00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.320
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.560
How about a driverless world?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.480
And I ask you that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.080
because we are increasingly in one.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.776
It's not supposed to be that way.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.576
We're number one,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.496
the United States is large and in charge.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.336
Americanization and globalization
for the last several generations

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.016
have basically been the same thing.
