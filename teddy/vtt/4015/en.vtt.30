Through our cell phones, individually,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.400
we have those voices
to compel them to change.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.200
There is, of course, a third choice,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.176
perhaps the most likely one,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.896
which is that we do
neither of those things,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.496
and in four years time you invite me back,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720
and I will give this speech yet again.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.176
Thank you very, very much.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.085
