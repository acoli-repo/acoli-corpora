they have a lot of political stability.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.856

Mr. Modi in India,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.136

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.296
of course Xi Jinping
who is consolidating enormous power,

just in the last couple of days,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.016
tested yet another nuclear weapon.
