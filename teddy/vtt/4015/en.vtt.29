00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.696
after the next president comes in?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.376
Well, either we have to have
another crisis that forces us to respond.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.056
A depression would do that.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.296
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.776
Or, absent crisis,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.936

the inequality, the challenges

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.336

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.896
to force our leaders to change,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.376
and that we have those voices.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.296
