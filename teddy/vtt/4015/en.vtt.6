You see. And the problem is
it's not a G20,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.416
the problem is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.416
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.856
a world order where there is
no single country or alliance

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.256
that can meet the challenges
of global leadership.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160
The G20 doesn't work,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.320
the G7, all of our friends,
that's history.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.376
So globalization is continuing.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.056
Goods and services and people
and capital are moving across borders

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.096
faster and faster than ever before,
