00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.576
and if the world were truly becoming
more flat and more Americanized,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.176
that would be less of a problem,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.696
but in a G-Zero world,
those countries nearest Russia

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.336
and nearest the Middle East

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.736
actually have different
economic capabilities,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.576
different social stability

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.776
and different political preferences
and systems than core Europe.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.816
So Europe was able to truly expand

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.896
under the G7,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.456
but under the G-Zero,
Europe will get smaller.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.496
Core Europe around Germany
and France and others

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.576
will still work, be functional,
stable, wealthy, integrated.
