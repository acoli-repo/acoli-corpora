David Biello: So Victor,
what have you been up to?

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.684
Victor Vescovo: That's the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.684
and I guess I read too much
Jules Verne as a young boy,

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.559
and so for the last four years
I've led a team to design and build

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:18.143
what is now the most advanced and deepest
diving submersible on the planet,

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.809
and I have the ability
to personally pilot it too.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.101
So this was us in December of last year,

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:25.768
for the first time --
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.726
DB: And nobody's seen that before right?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.476
That's just you.
VV: No.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.893
Well, now everybody else.
