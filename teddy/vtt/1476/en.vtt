00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:03.652
So why do we learn mathematics?

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.200
Essentially, for three reasons:

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.828
calculation,

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:09.728
application,

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.415
and last, and unfortunately least

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:14.520
in terms of the time we give it,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.442
inspiration.

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.714
Mathematics is the science of patterns,

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:22.072
and we study it to learn how to think logically,

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:24.599
critically and creatively,

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.525
but too much of the mathematics
that we learn in school

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.844
is not effectively motivated,

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:31.269
and when our students ask,
