Like so many of you,

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.698
when I'm hungry, I open the fridge

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:07.650
and get myself something to eat
any time I want.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.545
This is something most of us
who live in a developed country

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.249
don't think much about.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:18.323
However, it is a luxury that I didn't
think I would ever have in my life

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.585
when I lived in a refugee camp
in Tanzania 23 years ago,

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.014
or even seven years ago,

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:25.387
when I was living
in my home country of Rwanda

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:27.339
before I moved to the USA.

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:29.696
I was only seven years old

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.704
when my home country of Rwanda
went through the tragedy of the genocide
