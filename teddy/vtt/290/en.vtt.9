00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.859
it is not a definition of environmental benefits.

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.762
Allow me to explain.

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:34.454
When something natural,

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.415
something that's made from a cellulose fiber

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:39.943
like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:42.231
or even a piece of paper,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.045
when something natural ends up

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:46.668
in the natural environment, it degrades normally.

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:48.532
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.669
as it was growing are naturally released

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.249
back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.223
but this is a net situation.

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:56.588
Most natural things

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.195
don't actually end up in nature.

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.606
Most of the things, the waste that 
we produce, end up in landfill.
