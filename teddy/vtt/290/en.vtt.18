00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:02.532
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,

00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:04.630
but we actually haven't really changed the design

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.301
of them that much since the 1950s.

00:09:07.301 --> 00:09:10.526
A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.448
cold boxes that we store stuff in.

00:09:12.448 --> 00:09:14.268
So imagine if we actually really started

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:17.013
to identify these problems and use that

00:09:17.013 --> 00:09:20.950
as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.303
design solutions that will solve those problems.

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:26.528
This is design-led system change,

00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:30.238
design dictating the way in which the system
