Lettuces have a habit of going soggy

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:32.729
in the crisper drawers, don't they?

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.139
Yeah? Soggy lettuces?

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.139
In the U.K., this is such a problem

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.837
that there was a government report a few years ago

00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:40.857
that actually said the second biggest offender

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:43.274
of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.

00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:45.692
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.

00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:47.905
Okay? So this is a problem, people.

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:50.015
These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:51.887
left, right and center because the crisper drawers

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:54.646
are not designed to actually keep things crisp.

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:56.855
Okay. You need a tight environment.

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:58.985
You need, like, an airless environment

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:01.710
to prevent the degrading that
would happen naturally.
