00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:31.695
In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.543
on average, the standard size

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.172
of a refrigerator.

00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:37.631
And the problem is, they're so big now,

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:39.825
it's easier for us to buy more food

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:41.816
that we can't eat or find.

00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:43.442
I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:45.652
that have been there for years, all right?

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:48.288
And so what happens is, we waste more food.

00:06:48.288 --> 00:06:51.633
And as I was just explaining,
food waste is a problem.

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.995
In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:57.570
of food purchased for the home is wasted.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.905
Half of the world's produced food is wasted.
