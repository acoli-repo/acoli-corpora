It's with how people use the product.

00:10:30.602 --> 00:10:32.437
Sixty-five percent of Brits

00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:34.781
admit to over-filling their kettle

00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:37.367
when they only need one cup of tea.

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:40.110
All of this extra water that's being boiled

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.078
requires energy, and it's been calculated

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:47.116
that in one day of extra energy use

00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:48.659
from boiling kettles

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:51.301
is enough to light all of the streetlights

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:53.924
in England for a night.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:56.042
But this is the thing.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.956
This is what I call a product-person failure.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:00.702
But we've got a product-system failure
going on with these little guys,
