00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.438
in order to have a clearer picture of how

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:36.244
everything that we do in the
technical part of those systems

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.025
affects the natural environment.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.995
So we go all the way back

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.198
to the extraction of raw materials,

00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:44.015
and then we look at manufacturing,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.874
we look at packaging and transportation,

00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.524
use, and end of life,

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:50.441
and at every single one of these stages,

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.960
the things that we do

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.791
have an interaction with the natural environment,

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.279
and we can monitor how that interaction

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.009
is actually affecting the systems and services
