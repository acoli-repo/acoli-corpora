00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:01.314
that our actions as individuals and as professionals

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:03.482
and as a society are actually having

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:06.187
on the natural environment?

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.030
So the thing about environmental folklore is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.085
it tends to be based on our experiences,

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:11.816
the things we've heard from other people.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:14.456
It doesn't tend to be based
on any scientific framework.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.123
And this is really hard, because we live

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:18.143
in incredibly complex systems.

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.863
We have the human systems

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.629
of how we communicate and interrelate

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.144
and have our whole constructed society,

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.037
We have the industrial systems,
which is essentially the entire economy,

00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:29.890
and then all of that has to operate

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.415
within the biggest system,
