00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.415
within the biggest system,

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:33.507
and, I would argue, the most important,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.163
the ecosystem.

00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:37.025
And you see, the choices that we make

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.458
as an individual,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.769
but the choices that we make

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.928
in every single job that we have,

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.548
no matter how high or low
you are in the pecking order,

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:47.599
has an impact on all of these systems.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.934
And the thing is that we have to find ways

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:51.873
if we're actually going to address sustainability

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:55.021
of interlocking those complex systems

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.965
and making better choices that result

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.549
in net environmental gains.
