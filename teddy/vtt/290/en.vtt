00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.355
So imagine, you're in the supermarket,

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:04.936
you're buying some groceries,

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:06.561
and you get given the option

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:10.196

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.598
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.548
In some cases, it's recyclable.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.342
So when people are looking at the plastic bag,

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.272
it's likely they're thinking of something like this,
