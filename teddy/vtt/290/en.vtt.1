00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.272
it's likely they're thinking of something like this,

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:33.655
which we all know is absolutely terrible,

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:35.871
and we should be avoiding at all expenses

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.226
these kinds of environmental damages.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.439
But people are often not thinking

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.457
of something like this,

00:00:42.457 --> 00:00:45.035
which is the other end of the spectrum.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:47.802
When we produce materials,

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.432
we need to extract them from the environment,

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:53.336
and we need a whole bunch
of environmental impacts.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.512
You see, what happens is, when we need

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:57.489
to make complex choices,

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.910
us humans like really simple solutions,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.526
and so we often ask for simple solutions.
