00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:01.710
to prevent the degrading that
would happen naturally.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.662
But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer

00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:05.370
with a slightly better seal.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.457
Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.

00:08:07.457 --> 00:08:10.182
Don't ever invite me over because I'll just
start going through your refrigerator

00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:11.700
and looking at all sorts of things like that.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.619
But essentially, this is a big problem.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:16.578
Because when we lose something
like the lettuce from the system,

00:08:16.578 --> 00:08:20.114
not only do we have that impact 
I just explained at the end of life,

00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:22.770
but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.041
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:27.459
We've had to clear land.

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:29.616
We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,

00:08:29.616 --> 00:08:31.740
fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.
