00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.526
and so we often ask for simple solutions.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.999
And I work in design.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:05.510
I advise designers

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.775
and innovators around sustainability,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.329
and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.251
I just want the eco-materials."

00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.535
And I say, "Well, that's very complex,

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:15.364
and we'll have to spend four hours talking about

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.279
what exactly an eco-material means,

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.199
because everything at some point

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:21.144
comes from nature,

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.239
and it's how you use the material

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:26.280
that dictates the environmental impact.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.069
So what happens is, we have to rely

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.127
on some sort of intuitive framework
