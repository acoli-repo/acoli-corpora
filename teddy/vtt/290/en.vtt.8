WEBVTT

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.009
is actually affecting the systems and services

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.924
that make life on Earth possible.

00:04:01.924 --> 00:04:03.560
And through doing this,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.850
we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.563
And we've busted a bunch of myths.

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:14.551
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.

00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.284
It's used a lot in marketing,

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:18.284
and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:20.217
when we're talking about sustainability,

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:22.663
and that's the word biodegradability.

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:27.611
Now biodegradability is a material property;

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.859
it is not a definition of environmental benefits.
