00:15:56.085 --> 00:16:00.302
for fueling systems-based solutions,

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:03.207
because as I've just demonstrated
with these simple products,

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:06.598
they're participating in these major problems.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.753
So we need to look across the entire life

00:16:08.753 --> 00:16:10.375
of the things that we do.

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.090
If you just had paper or plastic --

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.854
obviously reusable is far more beneficial --

00:16:14.854 --> 00:16:18.325
then the paper is worse,

00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:20.371
and the paper is worse because it weighs

00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:22.475
four to 10 times more than the plastic,

00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:24.842
and when we actually compare,
from a life cycle perspective,

00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:27.532
a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,

00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:29.178
the paper is far better,

00:16:29.178 --> 00:16:31.718
but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag
