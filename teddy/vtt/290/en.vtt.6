00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.549
in net environmental gains.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.197
What we need to do is we need to learn

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:04.273
to do more with less.

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:06.164
We have an increasing population,

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:07.998
and everybody likes their mobile phones,

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:10.113
especially in this situation here.

00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:14.168
So we need to find innovative ways of solving
some of these problems that we face.

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:17.363
And that's where this process called
life cycle thinking comes in.

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:20.053
So essentially, everything that is created

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:22.564
goes through a series of life cycle stages,

00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:24.426
and we use this scientific process

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:26.150
called life cycle assessment,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.891
or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.438
in order to have a clearer picture of how
