00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:30.628
We need to find ways of solving
the problems around this,

00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:33.525
because these things are so complicated.

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.831
They have so much locked up inside them.

00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:40.594
Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:44.211
to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones

00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:47.439
than it is out of a ton of gold ore?

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:49.829
There's a number of highly complex and valuable

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.430
materials embodied inside these things,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.888
so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,

00:13:53.888 --> 00:13:56.052
because this is otherwise what happens.

00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:57.726
This is a community in Ghana,

00:13:57.726 --> 00:13:59.984
and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste

00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:01.960
is reported by the U.N.
