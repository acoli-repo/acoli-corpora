or a designer, and they were designing one of these,

00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:02.561
and they wanted to do it eco,

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:04.479
they'd usually ask me two things.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.523
They'd say, "Leyla, how do I
make it technically efficient?"

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:10.811
Because obviously energy's
a problem with this product.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.876
Or, "How do I make it green materials?

00:10:13.876 --> 00:10:16.786
How do I make the materials green

00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:18.608
in the manufacturing?"

00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:20.411
Would you ask me those questions?

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:23.210
They seem logical, right? Yeah.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.769
Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:27.927
Because the problem is with use.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.602
It's with how people use the product.
