00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:31.081
contribute to climate change.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.473
You see, there are facilities now

00:05:32.473 --> 00:05:34.177
that can actually capture that methane

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:35.615
and generate power,

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.406
displacing the need for fossil fuel power,

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:39.871
but we need to be smart about this.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.036
We need to identify how we can start to leverage

00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:45.340
these types of things that are already happening

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.208
and start to design systems and services

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.091
that alleviate these problems.

00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.336
Because right now, what people do
is they turn around and they say,

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:54.895
"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper

00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:56.822
because that is better for the environment."

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.240
But if you're throwing it in the bin,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.703
and your local landfill facility

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:02.124
is just a normal one,
