00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:02.104
just because the product hasn't
thought about the problem

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.967
that it's going to have when it exists in the world.

00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:06.635
Now, I looked at a number of
kettles available on the market,

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.657
and found the minimum fill lines,

00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:10.423
so the little piece of information that tells you

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:11.980
how much you need to put in there,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.899
was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:18.332
just to make one cup of tea.

00:12:18.332 --> 00:12:20.617
So this kettle here is an example of one where

00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:23.153
it actually has two reservoirs.

00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:25.340
One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.665
The user actually has to push that button

00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:29.233
to get their hot water boiled,

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.999
which means, because we're all lazy,
