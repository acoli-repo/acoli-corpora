00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:30.238
design dictating the way in which the system

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.003
can be far more sustainable.

00:09:33.003 --> 00:09:35.097
Forty percent food waste is a major problem.

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:39.162
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.513
Another item that I find fascinating

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.766
is the electric tea kettle,

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.159
which I found out that

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:47.410
you don't do tea kettles in
this country, really, do you?

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.498
But that's really big in the U.K.

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:51.731
Ninety-seven percent of households

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:54.663
in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.

00:09:54.663 --> 00:09:56.270
So they're very popular.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.070
And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.322
or a designer, and they were designing one of these,
