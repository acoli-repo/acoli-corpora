00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:02.124
is just a normal one,

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:07.030
then we're having what's called a double negative.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.194
I'm a product designer by trade.

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:11.386
I then did social science.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:12.803

by consumer goods and how the consumer goods

and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.076
has a refrigerator.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:27.708
