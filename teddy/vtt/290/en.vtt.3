00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.127
on some sort of intuitive framework

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:31.702
when we make decisions.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.032
So I like to call that intuitive framework

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.627
our environmental folklore.

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.384
It's either the little voice
at the back of your head,

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:41.656
or it's that gut feeling you get

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.236
when you've done the right thing,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.784
so when you've picked the paper bag

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:47.899
or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.858
And environmental folklore is a really important thing

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:53.306
because we're trying to do the right thing.

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.650
But how do we know if we're actually

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.973
reducing the net environmental impacts

00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:01.314
that our actions as individuals and as professionals
