00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.606
Most of the things, the waste that 
we produce, end up in landfill.

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:04.008
Landfill is a different environment.

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:06.451
In landfill, those same carbon molecules

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:07.969
degrade in a different way,

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.881
because a landfill is anaerobic.

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.299
It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:15.647
Those same molecules, they become methane,

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:18.565
and methane is a 25 times more potent

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:21.418
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:24.171
So our old lettuces and products

00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:25.750
that we have thrown out that are made

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.320
out of biodegradable materials,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.055
if they end up in landfill,

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:31.081
contribute to climate change.
