00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.830
to image on the surface of the moon.

00:03:30.854 --> 00:03:34.471
In fact, here I show one of the highest
resolution images ever taken

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:35.892
of the moon from Earth.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.473
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:42.547
and yet each pixel would contain
over 1.5 million oranges.

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.368
So how big of a telescope do we need

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.157
in order to see an orange
on the surface of the moon

00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:50.395
and, by extension, our black hole?

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.759
Well, it turns out
that by crunching the numbers,

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.393
you can easily calculate
that we would need a telescope

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:56.810
the size of the entire Earth.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:57.858
(Laughter)

00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:00.001
If we could build
this Earth-sized telescope,
