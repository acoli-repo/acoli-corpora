00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:31.515
to three different sketch artists
from all around the world.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:34.399
If they all produce
a very similar-looking face,

00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:36.216
then we can start to become confident

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.856
that they're not imposing their own
cultural biases on the drawings.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.195
One way we can try to impose
different image features

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:45.660
is by using pieces of existing images.

00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:48.374
So we take a large collection of images,

00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:51.116
and we break them down
into their little image patches.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.425
We then can treat each image patch
a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:59.727
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces
to piece together an image

00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.203
that also fits our telescope measurements.
