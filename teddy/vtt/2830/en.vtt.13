WEBVTT

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:31.509
is to design algorithms that find
the most reasonable image

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:33.755
that also fits the telescope measurements.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:38.669
Just as a forensic sketch artist
uses limited descriptions

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:42.207
to piece together a picture using
their knowledge of face structure,

00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.546
the imaging algorithms I develop
use our limited telescope data

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.892
to guide us to a picture that also
looks like stuff in our universe.

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:53.567
Using these algorithms,
we're able to piece together pictures

00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.771
from this sparse, noisy data.

00:06:55.795 --> 00:07:00.324
So here I show a sample reconstruction
done using simulated data,
