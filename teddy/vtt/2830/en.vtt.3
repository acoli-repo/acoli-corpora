00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.131
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.617
And if you could zoom past
millions of stars,

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.396
26,000 light-years toward the heart
of the spiraling Milky Way,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.941
we'd eventually reach
a cluster of stars right at the center.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.171
Peering past all the galactic dust
with infrared telescopes,

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.062
astronomers have watched these stars
for over 16 years.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:50.675
But it's what they don't see
that is the most spectacular.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.765
These stars seem to orbit
an invisible object.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.112
By tracking the paths of these stars,

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:57.430
astronomers have concluded

00:01:57.454 --> 00:02:00.583
that the only thing small and heavy
enough to cause this motion
