00:06:55.795 --> 00:07:00.324
So here I show a sample reconstruction
done using simulated data,

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.281
when we pretend to point our telescopes

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.890
to the black hole
in the center of our galaxy.

00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:09.369
Although this is just a simulation,
reconstruction such as this give us hope

00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:12.846
that we'll soon be able to reliably take
the first image of a black hole

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.465
and from it, determine
the size of its ring.

00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:19.317
Although I'd love to go on
about all the details of this algorithm,

00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.515
luckily for you, I don't have the time.

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.540
But I'd still like
to give you a brief idea

00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:25.866
of how we define
what our universe looks like,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.356
and how we use this to reconstruct
and verify our results.
