00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.356
and how we use this to reconstruct
and verify our results.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.876
Since there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.265
that perfectly explain
our telescope measurements,

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.894
we have to choose
between them in some way.

00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:39.756
We do this by ranking the images

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.614
based upon how likely they are
to be the black hole image,

00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:45.120
and then choosing the one
that's most likely.

00:07:45.144 --> 00:07:47.339
So what do I mean by this exactly?

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:49.840
Let's say we were trying to make a model

00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:53.047
that told us how likely an image
were to appear on Facebook.

00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:54.772
We'd probably want the model to say

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:58.353
it's pretty unlikely that someone
would post this noise image on the left,

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.796
and pretty likely that someone
would post a selfie
