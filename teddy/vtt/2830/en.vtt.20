00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.203
that also fits our telescope measurements.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.783
Different types of images have
very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:09.613
So what happens when we take the same data

00:10:09.637 --> 00:10:13.767
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces
to reconstruct the image?

00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:18.557
Let's first start with black hole
image simulation puzzle pieces.

00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:20.172
OK, this looks reasonable.

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:22.890
This looks like what we expect
a black hole to look like.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.107
But did we just get it

00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:27.445
because we just fed it little pieces
of black hole simulation images?

00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:29.349
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces

00:10:29.373 --> 00:10:31.882
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.
