00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.760
But one thing predicted
from this theory, black holes,

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:35.134
still have not been directly observed.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:38.364
Although we have some idea
as to what a black hole might look like,

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.167
we've never actually taken
a picture of one before.

00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.470
However, you might be surprised to know
that that may soon change.

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:49.658
We may be seeing our first picture
of a black hole in the next couple years.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.640
Getting this first picture will come down
to an international team of scientists,

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:55.231
an Earth-sized telescope

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.087
and an algorithm that puts together
the final picture.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.639
Although I won't be able to show you
a real picture of a black hole today,
