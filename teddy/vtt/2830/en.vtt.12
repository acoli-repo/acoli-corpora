00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:02.688
in order to reconstruct
the underlying black hole image.

00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:05.348
If we had telescopes located
everywhere on the globe --

00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:07.313
in other words, the entire disco ball --

00:06:07.337 --> 00:06:08.621
this would be trivial.

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:11.967
However, we only see a few samples,
and for that reason,

00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.379
there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.367
that are perfectly consistent
with our telescope measurements.

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.407
However, not all images are created equal.

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.307
Some of those images look more like
what we think of as images than others.

00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.553
And so, my role in helping to take
the first image of a black hole

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:31.509
is to design algorithms that find
the most reasonable image
