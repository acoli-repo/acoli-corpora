00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.204
the same size to us as an orange
on the surface of the moon.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.582
That makes taking a picture of it
extremely difficult.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.947
Why is that?

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:09.700
Well, it all comes down
to a simple equation.

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.140
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:13.519
there are fundamental limits

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:16.213
to the smallest objects
that we can possibly see.

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.461
This governing equation says
that in order to see smaller and smaller,

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.072
we need to make our telescope
bigger and bigger.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:26.165
But even with the most powerful
optical telescopes here on Earth,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.608
we can't even get close
to the resolution necessary

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.830
to image on the surface of the moon.
