00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.947
This data is then processed in a lab
right here in Massachusetts.

00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:03.765
So how does this even work?

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.192
Remember if we want to see the black hole
in the center of our galaxy,

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:10.198
we need to build this impossibly large
Earth-sized telescope?

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:12.454
For just a second,
let's pretend we could build

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.320
a telescope the size of the Earth.

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.799
This would be a little bit
like turning the Earth

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:18.570
into a giant spinning disco ball.

00:05:18.594 --> 00:05:20.794
Each individual mirror would collect light

00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:23.415
that we could then combine
together to make a picture.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.100
However, now let's say
we remove most of those mirrors

00:05:26.124 --> 00:05:28.096
so only a few remained.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.997
We could still try to combine
this information together,
