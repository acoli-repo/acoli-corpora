00:01:57.454 --> 00:02:00.583
that the only thing small and heavy
enough to cause this motion

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.575
is a supermassive black hole --

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.777
an object so dense that it sucks up
anything that ventures too close --

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.295
even light.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.380
But what happens if we were
to zoom in even further?

00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:16.137
Is it possible to see something
that, by definition, is impossible to see?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.963
Well, it turns out that if we were
to zoom in at radio wavelengths,

00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:21.669
we'd expect to see a ring of light

00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:24.104
caused by the gravitational
lensing of hot plasma

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:25.957
zipping around the black hole.

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:27.141
In other words,

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.336
the black hole casts a shadow
on this backdrop of bright material,
