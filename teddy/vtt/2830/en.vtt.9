00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.974
an international collaboration
called the Event Horizon Telescope

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:36.107
is creating a computational telescope
the size of the Earth,

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.668
capable of resolving structure

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.891
on the scale of a black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.302
This network of telescopes is scheduled
to take its very first picture

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.141
of a black hole next year.

00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:48.503
Each telescope in the worldwide
network works together.

00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.239
Linked through the precise timing
of atomic clocks,

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.920
teams of researchers at each
of the sites freeze light

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:56.906
by collecting thousands
of terabytes of data.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.947
This data is then processed in a lab
right here in Massachusetts.
