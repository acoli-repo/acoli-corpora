00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.796
and pretty likely that someone
would post a selfie

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.154
like this one on the right.

00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:03.817
The image in the middle is blurry,

00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:06.480
so even though it's more likely
we'd see it on Facebook

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:07.864
compared to the noise image,

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:10.848
it's probably less likely we'd see it
compared to the selfie.

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:13.162
But when it comes to images
from the black hole,

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:16.688
we're posed with a real conundrum:
we've never seen a black hole before.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.003
In that case, what is a likely
black hole image,

00:08:19.027 --> 00:08:21.965
and what should we assume
about the structure of black holes?

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:24.621
We could try to use images
from simulations we've done,

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.175
like the image of the black hole
from "Interstellar,"

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.137
but if we did this,
it could cause some serious problems.
