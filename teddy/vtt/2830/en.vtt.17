00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.137
but if we did this,
it could cause some serious problems.

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:33.541
What would happen
if Einstein's theories didn't hold?

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:37.526
We'd still want to reconstruct
an accurate picture of what was going on.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.921
If we bake Einstein's equations
too much into our algorithms,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.700
we'll just end up seeing
what we expect to see.

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:46.000
In other words,
we want to leave the option open

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:48.947
for there being a giant elephant
at the center of our galaxy.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:50.028
(Laughter)

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:53.041
Different types of images have
very distinct features.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.613
We can easily tell the difference
between black hole simulation images

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.913
and images we take
every day here on Earth.

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:02.041
We need a way to tell our algorithms
what images look like
