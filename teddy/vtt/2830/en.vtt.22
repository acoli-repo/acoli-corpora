00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:03.236
and use them to reconstruct
many different kinds of source images.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.531
So in our simulations,

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:08.330
we pretend a black hole looks like
astronomical non-black hole objects,

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:12.203
as well as everyday images like
the elephant in the center of our galaxy.

00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:15.395
When the results of our algorithms
on the bottom look very similar

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:17.515
to the simulation's truth image on top,

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:20.885
then we can start to become
more confident in our algorithms.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:22.776
And I really want to emphasize here

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.734
that all of these pictures were created

00:11:24.758 --> 00:11:27.694
by piecing together little pieces
of everyday photographs,

00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:29.933
like you'd take with your own
personal camera.

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:33.233
So an image of a black hole
we've never seen before
