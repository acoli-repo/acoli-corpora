00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:00.001
If we could build
this Earth-sized telescope,

00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:02.950
we could just start to make out
that distinctive ring of light

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:05.157
indicative of the black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:08.099
Although this picture wouldn't contain
all the detail we see

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.629
in computer graphic renderings,

00:04:09.653 --> 00:04:11.952
it would allow us to safely get
our first glimpse

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:14.463
of the immediate environment
around a black hole.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.100
However, as you can imagine,

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:19.748
building a single-dish telescope
the size of the Earth is impossible.

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:21.659
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:23.474
"You can't always get what you want,

00:04:23.498 --> 00:04:25.685
but if you try sometimes,
you just might find

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:26.924
you get what you need."

00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:29.412
And by connecting telescopes
from around the world,

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.974
an international collaboration
called the Event Horizon Telescope
