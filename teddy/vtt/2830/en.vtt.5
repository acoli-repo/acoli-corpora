00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.336
the black hole casts a shadow
on this backdrop of bright material,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.202
carving out a sphere of darkness.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:35.565
This bright ring reveals
the black hole's event horizon,

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.989
where the gravitational pull
becomes so great

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:39.639
that not even light can escape.

00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:42.522
Einstein's equations predict
the size and shape of this ring,

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.754
so taking a picture of it
wouldn't only be really cool,

00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:48.396
it would also help to verify
that these equations hold

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.886
in the extreme conditions
around the black hole.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.468
However, this black hole
is so far away from us,

00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:56.590
that from Earth, this ring appears
incredibly small --

00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.204
the same size to us as an orange
on the surface of the moon.
