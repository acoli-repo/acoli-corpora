00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.639
Although I won't be able to show you
a real picture of a black hole today,

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:04.574
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse
into the effort involved

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.211
in getting that first picture.

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:08.914
My name is Katie Bouman,

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.504
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:13.555
I do research in a computer science lab

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.877
that works on making computers
see through images and video.

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.063
But although I'm not an astronomer,

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:20.372
today I'd like to show you

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:23.299
how I've been able to contribute
to this exciting project.

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.154
If you go out past
the bright city lights tonight,

00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:28.614
you may just be lucky enough
to see a stunning view

00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.131
of the Milky Way Galaxy.
