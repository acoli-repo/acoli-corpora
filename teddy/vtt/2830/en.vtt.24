00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:02.648
that although I began this project
with no background in astrophysics,

00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:05.291
what we have achieved
through this unique collaboration

00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:08.074
could result in the very first
images of a black hole.

00:12:08.098 --> 00:12:10.796
But big projects like
the Event Horizon Telescope

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.634
are successful due to all
the interdisciplinary expertise

00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:15.448
different people bring to the table.

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:17.178
We're a melting pot of astronomers,

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:19.434
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:22.012
This is what will make it soon possible

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:24.889
to achieve something
once thought impossible.

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:27.169
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.289
and help push the boundaries of science,

00:12:29.313 --> 00:12:33.214
even if it may at first seem
as mysterious to you as a black hole.
