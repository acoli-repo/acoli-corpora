In the movie "Interstellar,"

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.647
we get an up-close look
at a supermassive black hole.

00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:08.814
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:10.956
the black hole's massive
gravitational pull

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.415
bends light into a ring.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.548
However, this isn't a real photograph,

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:16.358
but a computer graphic rendering --

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.772
an artistic interpretation
of what a black hole might look like.

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:21.567
A hundred years ago,

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.192
Albert Einstein first published
his theory of general relativity.

00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:26.655
In the years since then,

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.652
scientists have provided
a lot of evidence in support of it.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.760
But one thing predicted
from this theory, black holes,
