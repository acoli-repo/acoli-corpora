00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.997
We could still try to combine
this information together,

00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:33.014
but now there are a lot of holes.

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:37.411
These remaining mirrors represent
the locations where we have telescopes.

00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:41.514
This is an incredibly small number
of measurements to make a picture from.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:45.376
But although we only collect light
at a few telescope locations,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.823
as the Earth rotates, we get to see
other new measurements.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:52.666
In other words, as the disco ball spins,
those mirrors change locations

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.589
and we get to observe
different parts of the image.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:59.631
The imaging algorithms we develop
fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:02.688
in order to reconstruct
the underlying black hole image.
