00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:32.736
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
of doing these hard things

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.645
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:37.469
because in all of these
non-deadline situations,

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.121
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:40.597
He has nothing to wake up for,

00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:43.319
so the effects of procrastination,
they're not contained;

00:11:43.343 --> 00:11:45.083
they just extend outward forever.

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:48.693
And it's this long-term
kind of procrastination

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:51.798
that's much less visible
and much less talked about

00:11:51.822 --> 00:11:54.723
than the funnier, short-term
deadline-based kind.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.850
It's usually suffered
quietly and privately.

00:11:58.816 --> 00:11:59.970
And it can be the source

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:03.729
of a huge amount of long-term
unhappiness, and regrets.
