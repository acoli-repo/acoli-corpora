00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.631
That's one box for every week
of a 90-year life.

00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:02.934
That's not that many boxes,

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.932
especially since we've already
used a bunch of those.

00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:11.739
So I think we need to all take a long,
hard look at that calendar.

00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:15.990

we're really procrastinating on,

00:13:16.014 --> 00:13:19.379
because everyone is procrastinating
on something in life.

00:13:20.782 --> 00:13:23.812
We need to stay aware
of the Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:27.947
That's a job for all of us.

00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:30.969
And because there's not
that many boxes on there,
