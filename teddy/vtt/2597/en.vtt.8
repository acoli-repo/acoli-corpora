00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:00.415
[This is a perfect time
to get some work done.] [Nope!]

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.372
So the Rational Decision-Maker
will make the rational decision

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.292
to do something productive,

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.266
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.798
so he actually takes the wheel,

00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:11.703

(Laughter)

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.589
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:24.479
to see if there's anything new
in there since 10 minutes ago.

00:04:24.503 --> 00:04:27.141
After that, we're going to go
on a YouTube spiral

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:30.415
that starts with videos
of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
