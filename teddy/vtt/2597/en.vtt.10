00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:00.271
He has no memory of the past,
no knowledge of the future,

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:01.992
and he only cares about two things:

00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:03.699
easy and fun.

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:07.430
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:08.662
If you're a dog

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:12.257
and you spend your whole life doing
nothing other than easy and fun things,

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.446
you're a huge success!

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.381
(Laughter)

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:16.691
And to the Monkey,

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.063
humans are just another animal species.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:24.593
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed
and propagating into the next generation,

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.903
which in tribal times
might have worked OK.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.777
But, if you haven't noticed,
now we're not in tribal times.

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:33.934
We're in an advanced civilization,
and the Monkey does not know what that is.
