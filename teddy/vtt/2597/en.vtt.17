00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:32.106
and zoom in to the bottom of India,
like 200 feet above the ground,

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.751
and scroll up for two and a half hours
til we get to the top of the country,

00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:37.753
so we can get a better feel for India."

00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:42.212
(Laughter)

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.634
So that's what we did that day.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.328
(Laughter)

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:52.500
As six months turned into four
and then two and then one,

00:08:52.524 --> 00:08:55.619
the people of TED decided
to release the speakers.

00:08:55.643 --> 00:08:58.255
And I opened up the website,
and there was my face

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.635
staring right back at me.

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.259
And guess who woke up?
