00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.004
I thought that was the end of everything.

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:03.587
But a week later I get a call,

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.097
and it's the school.

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:07.396
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.888
And I say, "Yeah."

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:11.252
And they say, "We need
to talk about your thesis."

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.531
And I say, "OK."

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:14.690
And they say,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.126
"It's the best one we've ever seen."

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.855
(Laughter)

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.704
(Applause)

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.247
That did not happen.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.409
(Laughter)

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.056
It was a very, very bad thesis.
