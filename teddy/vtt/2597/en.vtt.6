00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:01.429
what goes on in the heads
of procrastinators,

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:02.893
and why we are the way we are.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.073
Now, I had a hypothesis

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.952
that the brains of procrastinators
were actually different

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.933
than the brains of other people.

00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:11.889
And to test this, I found an MRI lab

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:14.345
that actually let me scan both my brain

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.024
and the brain of a proven
non-procrastinator,

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:18.483
so I could compare them.

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.708
I actually brought them here
to show you today.

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:24.269
I want you to take a look carefully
to see if you can notice a difference.

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:26.607
I know that if you're not
a trained brain expert,

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:28.894
it's not that obvious,
but just take a look, OK?

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.046
So here's the brain
of a non-procrastinator.
