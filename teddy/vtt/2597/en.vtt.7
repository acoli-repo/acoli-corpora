00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.046
So here's the brain
of a non-procrastinator.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.109
(Laughter)

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.284
Now ...

00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:37.639
here's my brain.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.006
(Laughter)

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:45.277
There is a difference.

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:48.292
Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.968
but the procrastinator's brain

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:52.978
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.304
Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator?

00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:57.769
Well, it means everything's fine
until this happens.

00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:00.415
[This is a perfect time
to get some work done.] [Nope!]
