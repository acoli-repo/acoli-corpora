00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.442
like when you're having dinner
or going to bed

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:02.294
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:03.768
That's why there's an overlap.

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:05.536
Sometimes they agree.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.382
But other times, it makes much more sense

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:12.008
to be doing things that are harder
and less pleasant,

00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:13.572
for the sake of the big picture.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.485
And that's when we have a conflict.

00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:17.332
And for the procrastinator,

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.865
that conflict tends to end
a certain way every time,

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.609
leaving him spending a lot of time
in this orange zone,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.960
an easy and fun place that's entirely
out of the Makes Sense circle.

00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:30.263
I call it the Dark Playground.
