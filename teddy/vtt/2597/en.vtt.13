00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:30.263
I call it the Dark Playground.

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:31.911
(Laughter)

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:35.063
Now, the Dark Playground is a place

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:38.279
that all of you procrastinators
out there know very well.

00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:40.696
It's where leisure activities happen

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.030
at times when leisure activities
are not supposed to be happening.

00:06:44.418 --> 00:06:46.308
The fun you have in the Dark Playground

00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:48.815
isn't actually fun,
because it's completely unearned,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.054
and the air is filled with guilt,
dread, anxiety, self-hatred --

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.196
all of those good procrastinator feelings.

00:06:54.703 --> 00:06:58.179
And the question is, in this situation,
with the Monkey behind the wheel,

00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:01.796
how does the procrastinator ever get
himself over here to this blue zone,
