00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:30.593
and so we were here.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.076
And then two months turned into one month,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.725
which turned into two weeks.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.058
And one day I woke up

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:40.343
with three days until the deadline,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.433
still not having written a word,

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.516
and so I did the only thing I could:

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.147
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.447
pulling not one but two all-nighters --

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.040
humans are not supposed to pull
two all-nighters --

00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:56.366
sprinted across campus,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.876
dove in slow motion,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.956
and got it in just at the deadline.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.004
I thought that was the end of everything.
