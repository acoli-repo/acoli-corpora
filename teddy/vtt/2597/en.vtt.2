00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:01.566
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.216
and then at the end,
I would kick it up into high gear

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.679
just like a little staircase.

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.765
How hard could it be
to walk up the stairs?

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.552
No big deal, right?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.900
But then, the funniest thing happened.

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:14.235
Those first few months?

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.958
They came and went,

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:17.567
and I couldn't quite do stuff.

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.440
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:20.631
(Laughter)

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:21.814
And then --

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:23.720
(Laughter)

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.528
But then those middle months
actually went by,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.734
and I didn't really write words,

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:30.593
and so we were here.
