00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:00.282
But there's a second kind
of procrastination

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.793
that happens in situations
when there is no deadline.

00:11:02.817 --> 00:11:05.507
So if you wanted a career
where you're a self-starter --

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.944
something in the arts,
something entrepreneurial --

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:11.493
there's no deadlines on those things
at first, because nothing's happening,

00:11:11.517 --> 00:11:13.761
not until you've gone out
and done the hard work

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:15.411
to get momentum, get things going.

00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:18.513
There's also all kinds of important things
outside of your career

00:11:18.537 --> 00:11:20.142
that don't involve any deadlines,

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:23.431
like seeing your family or exercising
and taking care of your health,

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:24.859
working on your relationship

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:27.564
or getting out of a relationship
that isn't working.

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:32.736
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
of doing these hard things
