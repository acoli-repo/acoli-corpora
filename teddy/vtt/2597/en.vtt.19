00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:31.148
all kinds of pretty insane
procrastinator behavior,

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.506
like how someone like me
could spend two weeks

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.374
unable to start the opening
sentence of a paper,

00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:40.169
and then miraculously find
the unbelievable work ethic

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:43.289
to stay up all night
and write eight pages.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:47.367
And this entire situation,
with the three characters --

00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.411
this is the procrastinator's system.

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:53.521
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:57.607
This is what I decided to write about
on the blog a couple of years ago.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.602
When I did, I was amazed by the response.
