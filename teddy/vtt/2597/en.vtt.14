00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:10.162
Well, turns out the procrastinator
has a guardian angel,

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:13.394
someone who's always looking
down on him and watching over him

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:14.848
in his darkest moments --

00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:16.967
someone called the Panic Monster.

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:20.069
(Laughter)

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:27.246

is dormant most of the time,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.172
but he suddenly wakes up
anytime a deadline gets too close
