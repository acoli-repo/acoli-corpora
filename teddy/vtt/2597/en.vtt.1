00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.374
but then, actually, the paper
would come along,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.339
and then I would kind of do this.

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:36.733
(Laughter)

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:38.900
And that would happen every single paper.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:43.520
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.831
a paper you're supposed
to spend a year on.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.474

It was way too big a project.

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:52.076
So I planned things out,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.305
and I decided I kind of had
to go something like this.

00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.233
This is how the year would go.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.224
So I'd start off light,

00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:01.566
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,
