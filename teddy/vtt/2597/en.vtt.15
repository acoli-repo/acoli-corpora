00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:35.776

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.972
And importantly, he's the only thing
the Monkey is terrified of.

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:44.574
Now, he became very relevant
in my life pretty recently,

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.844
because the people of TED
reached out to me about six months ago

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:49.889

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:52.341

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.965
Now, of course, I said yes.

00:07:56.989 --> 00:08:00.794
It's always been a dream of mine
to have done a TED Talk in the past.
