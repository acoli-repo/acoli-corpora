00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:02.015
So in college,

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:04.913
I was a government major,

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.399
which means I had to write
a lot of papers.

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:09.471
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.868
they might spread the work out
a little like this.

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:13.043
So, you know --

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:14.724
(Laughter)

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.575
you get started maybe a little slowly,

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.567
but you get enough done in the first week

00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:20.422
that, with some heavier days later on,

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:22.603
everything gets done, things stay civil.

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:23.829
(Laughter)

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:26.124
And I would want to do that like that.

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:27.342
That would be the plan.

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.856
I would have it all ready to go,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.374
but then, actually, the paper
would come along,
