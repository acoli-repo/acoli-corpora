that I don't think
non-procrastinators exist.

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.215
That's right -- I think all of you
are procrastinators.

00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:39.812

00:12:39.836 --> 00:12:41.186
like some of us,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.739
(Laughter)

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:46.079
and some of you may have
a healthy relationship with deadlines,

00:12:46.103 --> 00:12:48.627
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick

00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:50.491
is when the deadlines aren't there.

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:53.281
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.678
I call this a Life Calendar.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.631
That's one box for every week
of a 90-year life.
