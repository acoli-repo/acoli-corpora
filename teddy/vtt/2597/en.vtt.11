00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:33.934
We're in an advanced civilization,
and the Monkey does not know what that is.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.239
Which is why we have
another guy in our brain,

00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.628
the Rational Decision-Maker,

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:41.679
who gives us the ability to do things
no other animal can do.

00:05:41.703 --> 00:05:43.624
We can visualize the future.

00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.400
We can see the big picture.

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:46.774
We can make long-term plans.

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:49.281
And he wants to take
all of that into account.

00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:51.829
And he wants to just have us do

00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:54.801
whatever makes sense
to be doing right now.

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:56.214
Now, sometimes it makes sense

00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.267
to be doing things that are easy and fun,

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.442
like when you're having dinner
or going to bed
