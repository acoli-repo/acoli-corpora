00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:30.520
would motivate political action.

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.919
They thought it would mobilize
protests, strikes,

00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:35.853
maybe even revolutions.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.444
But again and again what they found
was that it paralyzed people,

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:43.278
because the truth is,

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:44.888
feeling less than other people

00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:46.261
brings shame.

00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:48.507
It makes people turn away,

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.418
disgusted with the system.

00:06:51.513 --> 00:06:53.542
Feeling better than other
people, though --

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:54.954
now that is motivating.

00:06:55.697 --> 00:06:58.971
It motivates us to protect that position,

00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:02.131
and it has important consequences
for our politics.
