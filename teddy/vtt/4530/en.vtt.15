00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.082
about other participants
who disagree with them

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:34.870
on those issues.

00:07:34.894 --> 00:07:36.827
Are they smart or incompetent?

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:40.367
Are they reasonable or are they biased?

00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:46.277
The better-than-average group
said anybody who disagrees with them

00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:49.174
must be incompetent, biased,

00:07:49.198 --> 00:07:50.976
blinded by self-interest.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.982
The below-average group

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.357
didn't assume that about their opponents.

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.163
Now, there are lots of psychology studies
