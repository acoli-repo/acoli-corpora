00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.950
Surveys show that
large majorities of Americans,

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:03.946
both Democrats and Republicans,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.535
believe inequality is too high
and want more equal pay.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:13.862
And yet as a society, we don't seem
to be able to find the common ground,

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:17.218
the consensus, the political will
to do anything about it.

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:21.915
Because, as inequality
has risen in recent decades,

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.154
political polarization
has risen along with it.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.888
We see those who disagree with us
as idiots or as immoral.
