00:10:58.903 --> 00:11:00.870
that if you were in a different position,

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.570
you might see things differently,

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:05.194
just like the subjects in our experiments.

00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:10.046
So if you're in the above-average
group in life --

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.790
and if you're watching a TED talk,
you most likely are --

00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:14.057
(Laughter)

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:15.914
then I leave you with this challenge:

00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:21.446
the next time you're tempted to dismiss
someone who disagrees with you

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.915
as an idiot,

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:26.371
think about the tailwinds
that helped you get where you are.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.864
What lucky breaks did you get

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:31.047
that might have turned out differently?
