00:04:55.293 --> 00:05:01.010
This difference between being rich or poor
and feeling rich or poor is important,

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.281
because the two don't always
line up very well.

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:06.351
You often hear people say with nostalgia,

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.835
"We were poor, but we didn't know it."

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.123
That was the case for me growing up,

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:13.417
until one day,

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.806
in the fourth-grade lunch line,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.822
we had a new cashier
who didn't know the ropes,

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:21.198
and she asked me for 1.25 dollars.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:26.672
I was taken aback, because I had never
been asked to pay for my lunch before.

00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:30.232
I didn't know what to say,
because I didn't have any money.
