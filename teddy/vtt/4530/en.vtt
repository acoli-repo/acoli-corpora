00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:05.598
that economic inequality
is historically high,

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:08.749
that the wealthiest one-tenth
of one percent in the United States

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:11.684
have as much wealth
as the bottom 90 percent combined,

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.704
or that the wealthiest
eight individuals in the world

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:16.944
have as much wealth

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.609
as the poorest 3.5 billion
inhabitants of the planet.

is associated with shorter lifespans,

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.226
less happiness,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.403
more crime
