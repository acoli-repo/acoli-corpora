Most people think they're
better drivers than average.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.698
(Laughter)

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:06.624
That's true even if you do the study
with a sample of people

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.230
currently hospitalized
for a car accident that they caused.

00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.345
(Laughter)

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:16.318
So we really want to see ourselves
as better than average,

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:17.754
and if we find out otherwise,

00:03:17.778 --> 00:03:20.636
it's a painful experience
that we have to cope with.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.613
And we cope with it
by shifting how we see the world.

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.264
To understand how this works,

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:29.424
my collaborators and I ran an experiment.
