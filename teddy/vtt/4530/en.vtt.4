have risen together.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.506
There are good psychological reasons

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.339
that inequality drives wedges
in our politics.

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:12.549
That means there are good
psychological paths

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:14.438
to improve both at once.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:18.937
To understand why inequality
is so powerful,

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.588
you have to first understand
that we are constantly comparing ourselves

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:24.207
to other people,

00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.006
and when we do that,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.971
we really like to come out on top,

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:31.579
and we find it painful
to be on the bottom.
