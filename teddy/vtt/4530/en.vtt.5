00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:31.579
and we find it painful

Psychologists call it
the "better-than-average effect."

00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:38.759
Most people believe
they're better than average

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.299
at just about anything they care about,

00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:46.997
which isn't strictly possible,
because that's just what average means.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.954
(Laughter)

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:52.184
But that's the way people feel.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.842
Most people think
they're smarter than average,

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.777
harder working than average

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.666
and more socially skilled.

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:02.176
Most people think they're
better drivers than average.
