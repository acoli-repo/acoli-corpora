00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.888
We see those who disagree with us
as idiots or as immoral.

00:01:32.103 --> 00:01:34.321
Nearly half of Democrats and Republicans

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:37.864
now think that the other side
is not just mistaken

00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:39.399
but a threat to the nation.

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:43.752
And that animosity prevents us
from finding the common ground

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.053
to change things.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.924
I'm a social psychology professor
at the University of North Carolina,

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:55.128
and I study the effects of inequality
on people's thinking and behavior.

00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:59.931
I'm going to argue that it's not just
an unfortunate coincidence

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:03.517
that inequality and political division
have risen together.
