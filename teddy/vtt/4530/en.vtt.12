00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:01.506
I started noticing how the kids
who paid for their lunch

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.418
seemed to dress better
than the free lunch kids.

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:08.074
I started noticing the big yellow blocks
of government cheese

00:06:08.098 --> 00:06:09.629
that showed up at our door

00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:12.896
and the food stamps my mother
would pull out at the grocery store.

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.217
I was always a shy kid,

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.882
but I hardly talked at all
after that at school.

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:19.880
Who was I to speak up?

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:26.040
For decades, social scientists
looked for evidence

00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:28.640
that feeling deprived
compared to other people

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:30.520
would motivate political action.
