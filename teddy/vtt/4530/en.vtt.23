What helping hands are you grateful for?

00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:37.885
Recognizing those tailwinds
gives us the humility we need

00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:41.545
to see that disagreeing with us
doesn't make people idiots.

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:45.015
The real hard work
is in finding common ground,

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:47.631
because it's the well-off
who have the power

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:50.827
and the responsibility to change things.

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:52.087
Thank you.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.389
