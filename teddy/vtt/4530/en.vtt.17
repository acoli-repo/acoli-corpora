Yes, a lot of us think
that people on the other side are idiots,

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:42.045
but the people politically engaged enough
to be yelling at each other about politics

00:08:42.069 --> 00:08:44.273
are actually mostly the well-off.

00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:49.734
In fact, as inequality has grown
in recent decades,

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:53.746
political interest and participation
among the poor has plummeted.

00:08:54.714 --> 00:08:57.764
Again, we see that people
who feel left behind

00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:02.529
aren't taking to the streets to protest
or organize voter registration drives.
