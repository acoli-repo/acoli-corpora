Now, there are lots of psychology studies

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:02.536
showing that when people agree with us,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.981
we think they're brilliant,

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:05.599
and when people disagree with us,

00:08:05.623 --> 00:08:07.352
we tend to think they're idiots.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:08.878
(Laughter)

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.213
But this is new because we found
it was driven entirely by the group

00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.023
that felt better than average,

00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:19.392
who felt entitled to dismiss
those people who disagree with them.

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:24.519
So think about what
this is doing to our politics,

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:29.957
as the haves and have-nots
spread further and further apart.
