00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:35.126
We asked participants to complete
a decision-making task to earn some money,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.105
and in reality, everyone earned
the same amount of money.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:41.833
But we randomly divided them
into two groups,

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:44.788
and we told one group
that they had done better than average,

00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:47.870
and we told the other group
they had done worse than average.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:53.083
So now we have one group that feels richer
and one group that feels poorer,

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.753
but for no objective reason.

00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:57.500
And then we asked them some questions.

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:01.886
When we asked them,
"How good are you at making decisions?"
