00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:34.003
and the invention of the vacuum pump
by Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle

00:04:34.027 --> 00:04:35.586
meant that people now understood

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.815
that a condition of vacuum
existed between the planets,

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.477
and consequentially
between the Earth and the Moon.

00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.929
And they had no way of overcoming this,

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.330
no way of thinking about overcoming this.

00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:48.231
And so, for well over a century,

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:52.025
the idea of a voyage to the Moon
made very little intellectual progress

00:04:52.602 --> 00:04:55.124
until the rise of
the Industrial Revolution

00:04:55.148 --> 00:04:57.899
and the development
of steam engines and boilers

00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.236
and most importantly, pressure vessels.
