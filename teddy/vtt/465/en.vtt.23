00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:30.152
because I think their stories
also tell us of the importance

00:11:30.176 --> 00:11:33.908
of the stories that we tell each other
about the future more generally.

00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:37.255
Because these stories don't just
transmit information or ideas.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.281
They can also nurture passions,

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:42.381
passions that can lead us
to dedicate our lives

00:11:42.405 --> 00:11:44.843
to the realization of important projects.

00:11:44.867 --> 00:11:47.351
Which means that these stories can and do

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:50.229
influence social and technological forces

00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:52.203
centuries into the future.

00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:56.836
I think we need to realize this
and remember it when we tell our stories.

00:11:57.233 --> 00:11:59.085
We need to work hard to write stories

00:11:59.109 --> 00:12:02.165
that don't just show us the possible
dystopian paths we may take
