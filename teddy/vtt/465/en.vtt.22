00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.213
This process has now been going on
for over 300 years,

00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:04.773
and the result is
a culture of spaceflight.

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:07.884
It's a culture that involves
thousands of people

00:11:07.908 --> 00:11:09.961
over hundreds of years.

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:13.115
Because for hundreds of years,
some of us have looked at the stars

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.331
and longed to go.

00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:16.028
And because for hundreds of years,

00:11:16.052 --> 00:11:17.895
some of us have dedicated our labors

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.396
to the development
of the concepts and systems

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.357
required to make those voyages possible.

00:11:23.857 --> 00:11:26.484
I also wanted to tell you
about Godwin, Poe and Verne

00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:30.152
because I think their stories
also tell us of the importance
