00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.685
And although this idea of a balloon-borne
voyage to the Moon may seem

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:42.714
not much more technically sophisticated
than the goose machine,

00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:46.812
in fact, Poe was sufficiently detailed

00:06:46.836 --> 00:06:50.028
in the description
of the construction of the device

00:06:50.052 --> 00:06:53.512
and in terms of the orbital

00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:57.954

in the very first spaceflight encyclopedia

00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:00.492
as a mission in the 1920s.
