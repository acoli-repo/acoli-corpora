00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:32.109
or, a Discourse Tending to Prove

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:36.068
that 'tis Probable There May Be
Another Habitable World in that Planet."

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.115
And note, by the way,
that word "habitable."

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:42.129
That idea in itself would have
been a powerful incentive

00:03:42.153 --> 00:03:45.377
for people thinking about how to build
machines that could go there.

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:49.212
In his books, Wilkins seriously considered
a number of technical methods

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:50.521
for spaceflight,

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:54.116
and it remains to this day
the earliest known nonfiction account

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.114
of how we might travel to the Moon.

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:59.376
Other stories would soon follow,
most notably by Cyrano de Bergerac,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.799
with his "Lunar Tales."
