00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.236
and most importantly, pressure vessels.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.119
And these gave people the tools to think
about how they could build a capsule

00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:07.352
that could resist the vacuum of space.

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.575
So it was in this context, in 1835,

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.584
that the next great story
of spaceflight was written,

00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:15.907
by Edgar Allan Poe.

00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:19.833
Now, today we think of Poe
in terms of gothic poems

00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:21.734
and telltale hearts and ravens.

00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:24.322
But he considered himself
a technical thinker.

00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:26.271
He grew up in Baltimore,

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:28.665
the first American city
with gas street lighting,

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.208
and he was fascinated
by the technological revolution
