00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:31.301
And it was their treatises
and their works in turn

00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:33.441
that inspired the first
technical communities

00:09:33.465 --> 00:09:35.524
and the first projects of spaceflight,

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:38.210
thus creating a direct chain of influence

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:40.645
that goes from Godwin to Poe to Verne

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:42.040
to the Apollo program

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.699
and to the present-day
communities of spaceflight.

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:48.269
So why I have told you all this?

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.081
Is it just because I think it's cool,

00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:55.118
or because I'm just
weirdly fascinated by stories

00:09:55.142 --> 00:09:57.427
of 17th- and 19th-century science fiction?

00:09:58.538 --> 00:10:00.165
It is, admittedly, partly that.
