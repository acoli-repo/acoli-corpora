00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:30.535
as well as a pre-Newtonian
concept of gravity

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.500
that had the idea
that the weight of an object

00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:36.272
would decrease with increasing
distance from Earth.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.599
And that's to say nothing
of his idea of a goose machine

00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:41.049
that could go to the Moon.

00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:42.708
(Laughter)

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:45.572
And while this idea of a voyage
to the Moon by goose machine

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:49.739
might not seem particularly insightful
or technically creative to us today,

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:54.093
what's important is that Godwin described
getting to the Moon not by a dream

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:57.498
or by magic, as Johannes Kepler
had written about,

00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.383
but rather, through human invention.
