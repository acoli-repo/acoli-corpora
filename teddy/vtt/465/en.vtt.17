00:08:28.356 --> 00:08:30.478
And it was after reading
"War of the Worlds"

00:08:30.502 --> 00:08:32.070
that Goddard wrote in his diary,

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.092
one day in the late 1890s,

00:08:34.116 --> 00:08:37.874
of resting while trimming
a cherry tree on his family's farm

00:08:37.898 --> 00:08:43.053
and having a vision of a spacecraft
taking off from the valley below

00:08:43.077 --> 00:08:44.953
and ascending into the heavens.

00:08:44.977 --> 00:08:48.934
And he decided then and there
that he would commit the rest of his life

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.439
to the development of the spacecraft
that he saw in his mind's eye.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.701
And he did exactly that.

00:08:55.238 --> 00:08:57.627
Throughout his career,
he would celebrate that day

00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:00.042
as his anniversary day,
his cherry tree day,
