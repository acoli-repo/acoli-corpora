It is, admittedly, partly that.

00:10:02.085 --> 00:10:04.562
But I also think
that these stories remind us

00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:07.472
of the cultural processes
driving spaceflight

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:09.896
and even technological
innovation more broadly.

00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:12.149
As an economist working at NASA,

00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:14.770
I spend time thinking about
the economic origins

00:10:14.794 --> 00:10:16.777
of our movement out into the cosmos.

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:22.526
And when you look before the investments
of billionaire tech entrepreneurs

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.258
and before the Cold War Space Race,

00:10:24.282 --> 00:10:27.795
and even before the military investments
in liquid fuel rocketry,

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:33.280
the economic origins of spaceflight
are found in stories and in ideas.
