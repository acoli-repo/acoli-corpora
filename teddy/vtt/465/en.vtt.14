And it was this attention to detail,
or to "verisimilitude," as he called it,

00:07:06.086 --> 00:07:08.157
that would influence the next great story:

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.969
Jules Verne's "From the Earth
to the Moon," written in 1865.

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:15.144
And it's a story that has
a remarkable legacy

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.194
and a remarkable similarity
to the real voyages to the Moon

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:20.724
that would take place
over a hundred years later.

00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:25.643

to the Moon takes place from Florida,

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.074
with three people on board,

00:07:28.098 --> 00:07:30.169
in a trip that takes three days --
