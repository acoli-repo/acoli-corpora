My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The early '70s, I was in college.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was a very revolutionary time.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It was a political ferment, so to say --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
students out in the streets of Paris,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
revolting against authority.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
America was jolted

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In India, we had the Naxalite movement,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the [unclear] movement.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But you know, when there is a political churning of society,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it unleashes a lot of energy.
