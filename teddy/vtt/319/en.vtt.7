00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:30.878
to crystalize and refine their own ideas.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.662
One researcher I worked with

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:34.438
who works on the molecular mechanisms

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.222
of neurodegenerative diseases

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:38.200
came up with experiments that were related

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.183
directly to the animation that
she and I worked on together,

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:45.304
and in this way, animation can
feed back into the research process.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:48.157
I believe that animation can change biology.

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:50.725
It can change the way that we
communicate with one another,

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:52.348
how we explore our data

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:53.675
and how we teach our students.

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:55.129
But for that change to happen,

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.286
we need more researchers creating animations,

00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.541
and toward that end, I brought together a team
