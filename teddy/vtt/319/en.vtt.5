00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.334
Molecular animations are unparalleled

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.775
in their ability to convey a great deal of information

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:39.367
to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.870
And I'm working on a new project now

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.308
called "The Science of HIV"

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:44.670
where I'll be animating the entire life cycle

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.774
of the HIV virus as accurately as possible

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:49.735
and all in molecular detail.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.886
The animation will feature data

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:54.862
from thousands of researchers
collected over decades,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.942
data on what this virus looks like,

00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:01.030
how it's able to infect cells in our body,
