00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.579
Take a look at this drawing.

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:04.183
Can you tell what it is?

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:06.930
I'm a molecular biologist by training,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.533
and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.625
They're usually referred to as a model figure,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.359
a drawing that shows how we think

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.023
a cellular or molecular process occurs.

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:19.522
This particular drawing is of a process

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:23.845
called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.455
It's a process by which a molecule can get

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.693
from the outside of the cell to the inside

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:31.230
by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle
