and doesn't begin to show

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.640
what we actually know about these processes.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.855
You might be surprised to know

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.622
that these simple drawings are the only way

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:12.454
that most biologists visualize
their molecular hypotheses.

00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:13.482
Why?

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.472
Because creating movies of processes

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:18.486
as we think they actually occur is really hard.

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.119
I spent months in Hollywood
learning 3D animation software,

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.400
and I spend months on each animation,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.750
and that's just time that most
researchers can't afford.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.950
The payoffs can be huge, though.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.334
Molecular animations are unparalleled
