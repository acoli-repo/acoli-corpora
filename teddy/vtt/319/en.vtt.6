00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:01.030
how it's able to infect cells in our body,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.002
and how therapeutics are
helping to combat infection.

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.331
Over the years, I found that animations

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.150
aren't just useful for communicating an idea,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.646
but they're also really useful

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.958
for exploring a hypothesis.

00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.152
Biologists for the most part are
still using a paper and pencil

00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:19.374
to visualize the processes they study,

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:22.854
and with the data we have now,
that's just not good enough anymore.

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:25.270
The process of creating an animation

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.927
can act as a catalyst that allows researchers

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:30.878
to crystalize and refine their own ideas.
