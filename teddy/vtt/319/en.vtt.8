WEBVTT

00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.541
and toward that end, I brought together a team

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:03.678
of biologists, animators and programmers

00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:06.725
to create a new, free, open-source software —

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.629
we call it Molecular Flipbook —

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.525
that's created just for biologists

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:14.070
just to create molecular animations.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.782
From our testing, we've found
that it only takes 15 minutes

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:21.050
for a biologist who has never
touched animation software before

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.786
to create her first molecular animation

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:25.308
of her own hypothesis.

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.458
We're also building an online database

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.233
where anyone can view, download and contribute
