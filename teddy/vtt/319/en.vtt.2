00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.862
So we start outside of the cell.

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:02.510
Now we're looking inside.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.590
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.878
that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:09.575
Through connections with a membrane,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:11.742
clathrin is able to deform the membrane

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.155
and form this sort of a cup

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.462
that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:17.246
that's now capturing some of the proteins

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.900
that were outside of the cell.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.398
Proteins are coming in now that
basically pinch off this vesicle,

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:24.982
making it separate from the rest of the membrane,

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:27.374
and now clathrin is basically done with its job,

00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:28.612
and so proteins are coming in now —

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:30.558
we've covered them yellow and orange —
