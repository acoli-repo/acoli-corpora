where anyone can view, download and contribute

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.849
their own animations.

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.820
We're really excited to announce

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.282
that the beta version of the molecular animation

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:40.490
software toolkit will be available for download today.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.233
We are really excited to see
what biologists will create with it

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.289
and what new insights they're able to gain

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.770
from finally being able to animate

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.473
their own model figures.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.713
