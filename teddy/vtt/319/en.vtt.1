00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:31.230
by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.050
that then gets internalized by the cell.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.885
There's a problem with this drawing, though,

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.517
and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:39.982
From lots of experiments,

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:41.817
from lots of different scientists,

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.813
we know a lot about what these molecules look like,

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:46.495
how they move around in the cell,

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:48.320
and that this is all taking place

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.310
in an incredibly dynamic environment.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.783
So in collaboration with a clathrin
expert Tomas Kirchhausen,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.102
we decided to create a new kind of model figure

00:00:57.102 --> 00:00:59.126
that showed all of that.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.862
So we start outside of the cell.
