00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:30.558
we've covered them yellow and orange —

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.100
that are responsible for taking
apart this clathrin cage.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.382
And so all of these proteins
can get basically recycled

00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:37.918
and used all over again.

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.327
These processes are too small to be seen directly,

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:43.159
even with the best microscopes,

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.790
so animations like this provide a really powerful way

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.808
of visualizing a hypothesis.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.654
Here's another illustration,

00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:53.390
and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.895
that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.

00:01:56.895 --> 00:01:59.414
And again, this is a vast oversimplification

00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:01.158
and doesn't begin to show
