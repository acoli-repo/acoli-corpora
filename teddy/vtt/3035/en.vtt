00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:04.485
Let's talk about how the narrative
of Africa is being told,

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.658
and who is doing the telling.

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:09.901
I want to share with you
the selection of work

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:13.800
by contemporary artists
from Africa and its diaspora.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.472
I love this art.

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:19.568
I find it beautiful
and inspiring and thrilling,

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:22.455
and I really hope I am able
to pique your interest.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.465
I want to share something about myself
and why art matters to me.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.753
I'm the daughter of an artist,
so that means that growing up,

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:32.814
I had the chance to see my father
do artwork in his studio.
