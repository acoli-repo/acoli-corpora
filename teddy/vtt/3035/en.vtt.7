I want to share
this other beautiful series

00:03:33.068 --> 00:03:36.178
called "Kesh Angels,"
by artist Hassan Hajjaj.

00:03:36.768 --> 00:03:38.150
So in this particular series,

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:40.406
the artist is really pushing
on the boundaries

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.737
of stereotype and cliché.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.065
Hassan Hajjaj is a friend,

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:46.963
and honestly, I admire him dearly,

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:51.878
but this particular series is talking
to me directly as a Muslim woman.

00:03:51.902 --> 00:03:53.998
I experience this all the time,

00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:56.419
where, you know, people
have a lot of expectations,

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.705
religious ones and cultural ones,

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.640
but what I love about this artist
is that he's putting all this on its head.
