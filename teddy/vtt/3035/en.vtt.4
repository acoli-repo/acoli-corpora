Diop is actually referencing
another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.188
This picture is doing a portrait
of Jean-Baptiste Belley.

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.992
Jean-Baptiste Belley
was a native of Senegal,

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:13.074
a former slave of Haiti,

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:18.091
but during his lifetime, he also
was elected to represent the colony

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:21.392
at the third government
of the French Revolution,

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:24.892
and he advocated strongly
for the abolition of slavery.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:28.043
What is very smart
and clever about Diop here

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:29.939
is that he's going back to history.
