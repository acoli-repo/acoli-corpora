00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:32.814
I had the chance to see my father
do artwork in his studio.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.188
My home was surrounded by art,

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:37.308
and I had an early art education,

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:41.357
being dragged to museums and exhibitions
over the summer holidays.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.658
What I did not understand,
really, at the time,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.944
is that this also gave me
an early understanding

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:49.571
about why art is important,

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.072
how to look at it,

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:53.648
how to understand it,
but also how to love it.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.365
So art matters to me on a personal level,

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.469
and not only because it's beautiful
and inspiring and thrilling,
