00:05:58.413 --> 00:06:01.794
as they are the ones shaking things up
and bringing new perspective.

00:06:01.818 --> 00:06:03.977
I want to share
this beautiful old painting

00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:08.763
by younger emerging artist
Kudzanai-Violet Hwami.

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:12.406
For me, when I see her work,
it really represents freedom.

00:06:13.302 --> 00:06:17.668
Hwami has fantastic takes
on what it means to be an African

00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:19.128
and an African life.

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:21.383
She has lived in three
different countries:

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.184
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Britain,

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.343
and therefore has been influenced
by a multitude of layers

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:29.367
of communities and cultures,

00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:34.490
from LGBT to eco to Xhosa
to emo to British cultures.
