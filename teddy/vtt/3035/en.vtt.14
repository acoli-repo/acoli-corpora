where he's asking us
to reclaim our voices.

I believe in the transformative
power of art,

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:13.862
as it is our only way to paint
a nuanced image of Africa,

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:15.957
but also its diaspora,

00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.615
one that will be painted by its artists
and its cultural producers

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.172
with their radical but also very unique
view of seeing the world

00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:25.577
and their place in it.

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:29.736
It is really through art
that we can regain

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.672
our sense of agency and empowerment.
