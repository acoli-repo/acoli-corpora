He's reclaiming this figure

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.154
by restaging this beautiful
royal blue uniform,

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:39.285
where he is restaging also the pose,

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.804
and he's doing that
to actually underline the issues

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:45.821
that are still impacting
individuals of color today.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:47.078
There was nothing special

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:50.801
about this very typical
political portrait of the time,

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.925
except that for the first time,

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.760
an individual of color,
in that case, Jean-Baptiste Belley,

00:02:55.784 --> 00:02:59.394
was actually named
and acknowledged in a painting.
