00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.640
but what I love about this artist
is that he's putting all this on its head.

00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:06.173
He's actually challenging
every representation

00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:09.555
of Muslim, Arabic women that there is.

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.277
Hassan Hajjaj is a child of the diaspora.

00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.530
He grew up in Morocco
amongst bright logo goods,

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:19.778
you know, counterfeit originals
being sold at the souks.

00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:23.111
So to see those symbols
representing in his work

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:27.652
a celebration of the global culture,
a critic of the global urban culture,

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.089
is no surprise,

00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:34.343
but really at the heart of his work
is his desire of a nuanced representation.
