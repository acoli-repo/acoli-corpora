00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.840
by Senegalese artist Omar Victor Diop.

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:35.030
This is a series of self-portraits,

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:36.974
and the artist in this particular series

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:41.111
is focusing on the representation
of Africans in art history

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.506
between the 15th to the 19th century.

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:47.726
I want to show you how, with one image,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.672
Diop is able to touch
on our African identity,

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.092
on the politics of representation,

00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:55.163
but also on our social value system.

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.114
In this particular self-portrait,

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:03.483
Diop is actually referencing
another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet.
