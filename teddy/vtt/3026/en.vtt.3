00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:30.971
So in 2005, when I had an opportunity
to get together with grassroots leaders

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.202
across the political divide,

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.692
I grabbed it.

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:37.850
And I became friends with a lot of people

00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:41.026
I never had a chance to talk to before.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.324
And that included leadership
in the Christian Coalition,

00:01:44.348 --> 00:01:48.773
often seen as on the right
the way MoveOn is seen as on the left.

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:52.144
And this lead to me
showing up on Capitol Hill

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:56.432
with one of the Christian Coalition
leaders, my friend,

00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:58.428
to lobby for net neutrality.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:01:59.603
That was powerful.

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:01.005
We turned heads.
