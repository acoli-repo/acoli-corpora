00:05:56.961 --> 00:06:00.376
We're not really like Vulcans
like Mr. Spock,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.762
we're more like bold cowboys
like Captain Kirk,

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:07.112
or passionate idealists like Dr. McCoy.

00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:10.393
OK, for those of y'all who prefer
the new "Star Trek" crew,

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:11.569
here you go.

00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:12.609
(Laughter)

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.530
JB: Don't forget the strong women!

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:16.326
JG: Come on, strong women. OK.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.527
JB: All right.

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.384
John and I are both "Star Trek" fans.

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:23.798
What's not to love about a future
with that kind of optimism?

00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:28.118
JG: And having a good future in mind
is a big deal -- very important.

00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:30.890
And understanding what the problem is
is very important.
