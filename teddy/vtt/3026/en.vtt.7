00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.225
Here's what happened.

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.361
There's just too much noise --
too many people, too many ideas --

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:35.897
so we use technology
to filter it out a little bit.

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:37.393
And what happens?

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.056
It lets in ideas I already agree with.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.992
It lets in the popular ideas,

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.810
it lets in people just like me
who think just like me.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.526
That sounds kind of good, right?

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:49.067
Well, not necessarily,

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.014
because two very scary things happen

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.216
when we have such narrow worldviews.

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:58.326
First, we become more extreme
in our beliefs.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:03.909
Second, we become less tolerant
of anybody who's different than we are.
