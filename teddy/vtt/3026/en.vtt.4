00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:01.005
We turned heads.

00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:05.607
So this work was transformational for me.

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:08.377
And I found myself wondering:

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:12.242
How could vast numbers of people
have the opportunity

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.840
to really connect with people
that have very different views?

00:02:16.972 --> 00:02:18.989
JG: I was born Oneida, Tennessee,

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:23.675
right across the state border
from a small coal mining town,

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.016
Stearns, Kentucky.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.556
And I lived there
for the first few years of my life,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.324
before moving to another small town,
Frankfort, Kentucky.
