00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:30.890
And understanding what the problem is
is very important.

00:06:30.914 --> 00:06:32.292
But we have to do something.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:33.499
So what do we do?

liberal and conservative;

00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:58.394
in the US, Democrat and Republican.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.650
