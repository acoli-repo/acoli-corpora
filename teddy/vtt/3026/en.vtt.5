00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.324
before moving to another small town,
Frankfort, Kentucky.

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.448
Basically, I grew up
in small-town America,

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:33.856
conservative at its heart.

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:38.574
Now, Stearns and Berkeley --
they're a little different.

00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:40.657
(Laughter)

00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:45.155
So in the '90s I moved out west
to a progressive area

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.706
to work in technology --

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.802
worked at Microsoft, worked at Netscape.

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:52.015
I actually became the product manager lead
for Netscape Navigator,

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.557
the first popular web browser.

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:56.095
Now in the early days of the internet,

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.295
we were just moved
and inspired by a vision:

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.566
when we're connected to all
these different people around the world
