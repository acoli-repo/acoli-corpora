00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.566
when we're connected to all
these different people around the world

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.108
and all these different ideas,

00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:05.958
we'll be able to make great decisions,

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:08.002
and we'll be able to appreciate each other

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.995
for the beautiful diversity
that the whole world has to offer.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.932
Now I also, 20 years ago, gave a speech

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:14.788
saying it might not work out that way,

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:19.330
that we might actually be trained
to discriminate against each other

00:03:19.354 --> 00:03:20.644
in new ways.

00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:23.757
So what happened?

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:27.858
It's not like we just woke up one day
and decided to hate each other more.

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.225
Here's what happened.
