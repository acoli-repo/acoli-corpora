00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.983
I once had this nightmare:

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:06.908
I'm standing in the middle
of a deserted field full of land mines.

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.036
In real life, I love to hike,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.729
but every time I want to go on a hike,
it makes me nervous.

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:16.851
I have this thought in the back of my mind

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.389
that I might lose a limb.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:22.101
This underlying fear started 10 years ago,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.423
after I met Mohammed,
a cluster bomb survivor

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:29.383
of the summer 2006
Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.
