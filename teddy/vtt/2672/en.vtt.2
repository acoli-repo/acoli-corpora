00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:02.311
When I arrived in Beirut
on assignment to cover that war,

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:04.803
I was relieved to be united
with my family,

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:07.950
after they had finally managed
to escape southern Lebanon.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:10.543
The day the war was over,

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.718
I remember seeing this image --

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:14.185
one of blocked roads,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:18.338
of displaced people eagerly rushing
south, back to their homes,

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:20.457
regardless of what they would find.

00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:24.444
An estimated four million
cluster submunitions

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:28.104
were spread in Lebanon during
the 34-day conflict.
