Mohammed lost both legs
during the last week of the conflict.

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:37.877
The fact that he lives a five-minute
drive from my parents' home

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.656
made it easier to follow
him through the years.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.660
It was now almost 10 years
since we first met.

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:45.860
I saw the young boy

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:49.764
who had to endure
physical and emotional trauma.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.609
I saw the teenager who tried
to offer his friends tattoos,

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.186
in return for a set fee of five dollars.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.313
And I know the young, jobless man
who spends hours surfing the Internet
