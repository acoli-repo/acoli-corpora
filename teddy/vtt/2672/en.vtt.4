And I know the young, jobless man
who spends hours surfing the Internet

00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:04.430
trying to meet a girl who might
become his girlfriend.

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:08.922
His fate and the effects
of losing his legs

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:10.943
are now his daily reality.

00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:13.967
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed

00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:17.444
have to deal with so many details
that never occur to us.

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:18.993
Who would have imagined

00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:21.752
that so many daily tasks we do
or take for granted,

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:26.029
such as going to the beach or even
picking up something from the floor,

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:29.077
would become sources
of stress and anxiety?

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.197
Well, that's what eventually
became of Mohammed,
