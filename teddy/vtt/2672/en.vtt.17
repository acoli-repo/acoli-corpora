So far, 119 states have joined
an international treaty

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:40.424
banning cluster bombs,

00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:43.487
which is officially called
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:47.867
But some of the biggest producers
of cluster munitions --

00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:51.230
namely, the United States,
Russia and China --

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:53.724
remain outside of this lifesaving treaty

00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:55.685
and continue to produce them,

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:58.528
reserve the right to produce
them in the future,

00:08:58.552 --> 00:09:01.278
keep those harmful weapons
in their stockpiles
