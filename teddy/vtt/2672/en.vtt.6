00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.200
And what for?"

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:04.155
Let me explain to you
what a cluster bomb is.

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.353
It's a large canister
filled with bomblets.

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:09.040
When it's dropped from the air,

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:13.164
it opens up in midair to release
hundreds of bomblets.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.750
They scatter around wide areas

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:16.927
and on impact,

00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.634
many fail to explode.

00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:22.569
Those unexploded ones end up
just like landmines --

00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:23.826
sitting on the ground,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.821
waiting for their next target.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.014
If someone steps on them by accident

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:30.196
or picks them up,
