00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:01.016
at the age of 11,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.656
would increase manyfold.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:05.361
Even before his disability,

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.602
Mohammed's life wasn't easy.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:10.906
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp
for Palestinian refugees,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.079
and this is where he still lives.

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:16.825
Lebanon holds some 400,000
Palestinian refugees,

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.147
and they suffer from discriminatory laws.

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:22.235
They're not allowed to work
in the public sector

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.242
or practice certain professions

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:27.254
and are denied the right to own property.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:28.533
This is one of the reasons

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:31.300
why Mohammed doesn't really
regret dropping out of school
