00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:02.972
I decided to go back to Lebanon
a few months after the conflict ended

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.969
to meet cluster bomb survivors.

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:06.144
And I met a few --

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:07.741
Hussein and Rasha,

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:09.766
who both lost a leg to submunitions.

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:14.359
Their stories are similar to so many
other kids' stories across the world

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:17.432
and are a testimony
to the horrifying implications

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.286
of the continuous use of such weapons.

00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:24.917
That's when I met Mohammed,
in January 2007.

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:26.707
He was 11 years old,

00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:30.245
and I met him exactly four months
after his accident.
