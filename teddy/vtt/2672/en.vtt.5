00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.197
Well, that's what eventually
became of Mohammed,

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.963
due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:40.135
Ten years ago, I had no clue
what a cluster bomb was,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.447
nor its horrifying implications.

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:45.272
I learned that this indiscriminate
weapon was used

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.811
in so many parts of the world

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.107
and continues to kill on a regular basis,

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.170
without distinguishing
between a military target

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:53.366
or a child.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.982
I naively asked myself,

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.385
"But seriously, who made those weapons?

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.200
And what for?"
