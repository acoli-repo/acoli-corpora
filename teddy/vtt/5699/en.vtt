00:00:01.917 --> 00:00:05.750
So the gods sent a message to an old king.

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:08.559
"We will disguise you

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.643
so that you can enter the enemy camp,

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.934
find your son's killer

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.667
and then you can try and ransom
your dead son's body back off him."

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:22.643
When the king tells his queen,

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:24.893
she is terrified.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.268
"Don't go!

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.625
Man-slaying Achilles will kill you too."
