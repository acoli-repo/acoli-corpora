So the question is, what is invisible?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There is more of it than you think, actually.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
except every thing and except matter.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when the husband was killed by the wife."
