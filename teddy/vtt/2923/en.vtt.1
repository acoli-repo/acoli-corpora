00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:30.918
and replenishing this picturous
restoring of painted skies,

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:32.773
mountains rolling,

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:34.417
forest covering --

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:36.403
no more warming.

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:40.802
The purity and simplicity
of how we used to be.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.341
You remember me?

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.033
All I give to humanity?

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:48.823
Housing, land, seas, birds,

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:51.775
beast and all of mankind,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.309
exclusively the interface
where you and the elements meet

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.853
and vibrate harmoniously.
