I started my investigation
by focusing on the regulatory framework.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.502
Right away, one fact surprised me:

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:09.774
the FDA does not vet manufacturer
applications by testing the drugs.

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:14.200
Instead, it reviews company data.

00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:20.731
As the FDA's generic drugs director
actually told me,

00:04:21.723 --> 00:04:27.326
"The approval system requires
the ethical behavior of the applicant.

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:33.155
Otherwise, the whole house
of cards will fall down."
