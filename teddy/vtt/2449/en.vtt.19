00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:33.276
thinking about Ranbaxy's
perilously bad drugs.

00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:36.887
So he risked his life to alert the FDA.

00:09:37.996 --> 00:09:42.335
After an eight-year investigation,
Ranbaxy pled guilty to seven felonies

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:43.617
for faking data.

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:46.538
An FDA consultant taught me

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:50.339
that just like cheap clothing
made in distant factories,

00:09:50.363 --> 00:09:53.363
or "fast fashion," as she called it,

00:09:53.387 --> 00:09:55.499
there were fast drugs, too,

00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.621
made in pharmaceutical sweatshops overseas

00:09:58.645 --> 00:10:02.737
with low-quality ingredients
and manufacturing shortcuts.
