I knew generic HIV/AIDS medicine
had saved many lives in Africa.

Here at home,

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.394
programs from Medicare to Medicaid
and the Affordable Care Act

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:14.712
depended on them.

00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:17.531

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:20.532

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.315
are not only safe and effective,
