00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:05.323
In 2008, I got an unusual phone call

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.731
from a guy named Joe Graedon.

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.870
Joe said he was getting flooded
with complaints from patients

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.969
who had recently been switched
to generic drugs.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.612
Joe was a trained pharmacologist

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:20.453
and cohost of a radio show on NPR.

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:26.654
Patient after patient said their generics
were causing unwelcome side effects

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:28.523
or even relapses.

00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:31.306
Joe believed the patients' claims.
