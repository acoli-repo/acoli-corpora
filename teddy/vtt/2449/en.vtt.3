00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.045
on-the-ground reporting
across four continents

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.499
and thousands of confidential files --

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:35.912
from the FDA,

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:37.902
from generic drug companies

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:39.934
and from the courts --

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.382
all pointed me in the same direction:

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:48.381
a large number of generic
drug manufacturers

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.730
in certain overseas countries

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.441
are passing off substandard drugs

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:58.188
as legitimate generics

00:01:58.212 --> 00:01:59.549
for profit.
