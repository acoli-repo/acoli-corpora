showing Ranbaxy had falsified data
for over 200 products

00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:08.800
in more than 40 countries.

00:09:09.989 --> 00:09:12.907
The new R and D director
showed this PowerPoint

00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:15.484
to a subcommittee
of the board of directors.

00:09:16.174 --> 00:09:21.845
The subcommittee ordered the report
and the laptop on which it was created

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:23.111
destroyed.

00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:26.636
Then they forced Thakur
out of the company.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.213
Thakur couldn't sleep,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:33.276
thinking about Ranbaxy's
perilously bad drugs.
