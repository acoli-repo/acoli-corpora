The overseas generics industry
calls this "dual-track production" --

00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:36.946
better drugs for some,

00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:40.020
failed drugs for others.

00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:42.796
In the developing world,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.698
this corrupt system
has flooded the market

00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:48.912
with so many bad drugs

00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:52.134
that public health researchers link them

00:13:52.158 --> 00:13:55.442
to the rise of drug-resistant infections.

00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:02.205
But criminal behavior by overseas
companies is only half the problem.
