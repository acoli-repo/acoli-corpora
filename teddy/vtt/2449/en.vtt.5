00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.561
or the tip of the iceberg?

00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.747
What I uncovered is disquieting,

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:45.469
and anyone who takes generic drugs
has the right to be deeply concerned.

00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:50.490
If you're skeptical about any of this,

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:52.029
that's fair.

00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:56.928
I saw generics as one of the world's
great public health innovations,

00:02:56.952 --> 00:02:59.848
a giant win for patients worldwide.
