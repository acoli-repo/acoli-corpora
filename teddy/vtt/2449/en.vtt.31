00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:36.160
We know where our breakfast cereal
and our running shoes are manufactured.

00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:39.378
Why is it different for generic drugs?

00:15:39.402 --> 00:15:41.070
Patients can do something else.

00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:44.948
They can tell their elected officials
and consumer organizations

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:48.928
to speak up just as loudly
to demand quality

00:15:48.952 --> 00:15:51.415
as they do to demand access.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:56.067
Consumer organizations can do
their members a great service

00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:58.186
by testing and ranking generics,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.199
just like cars and washing machines.
