♪ As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea ♪

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.763
♪ And the last ship sails ♪

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.385
So I was born and raised

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.272
in the shadow of a shipyard

00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:45.288
in a little town on the northeast coast of England.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:47.306
Some of my earliest memories

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.284
are of giant ships

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:52.014
blocking the end of my street,

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:55.059
as well as the sun, for a lot of the year.

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:57.016
Every morning as a child,

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.121
I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill
