00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.575
but at the age of eight,

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.367
I was bequeathed a guitar.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:05.783
It was a battered old thing

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:09.391
with five rusty strings, and was out of tune,

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:11.839
but quickly I learned to play it

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:17.037
and realized that I'd found a friend for life,

00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:19.703
an accomplice, a co-conspirator

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:23.587
in my plan to escape from this surreal

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.275
industrial landscape.

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.357
Well, they say if you dream something hard enough,

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.097
it will come to pass.
