00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.697
and nothing's coming.

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:32.969
And those days turned to
weeks, and weeks to months,

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.562
and pretty soon those months

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:35.793
have turned into years

00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:40.612
with very little to show for your efforts. No songs.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.123
So you start asking yourself questions.

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.296
What have I done to offend the gods

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:48.863
that they would abandon me so?

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:51.599
Is the gift of songwriting taken away

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.856
as easily as it seems to have been bestowed?

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.889
Or perhaps there's a more --

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.989
a deeper psychological reason.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:02.004
It was always a Faustian pact anyway.
