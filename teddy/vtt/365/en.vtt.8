00:03:57.607 --> 00:04:00.247
have children, raise a family,

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.231
buy a big house in the country,

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.951
keep dogs, grow wine,

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.961
have rooms full of Grammy Awards,

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:10.257
platinum discs, and what have you.

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:14.871
So far, so good, right? (Laughter)

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:19.061
And then one day, the songs stopped coming,

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.978
and while you've suffered from periods

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:24.990
of writer's block before, albeit briefly,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.927
this is something chronic.

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:29.061
Day after day, you face a blank page,

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.697
and nothing's coming.
