00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.603
I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,

00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:36.525
a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,

00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:39.847
of verses, couplets, entire songs

00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:42.359
almost formed whole,

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:44.019
materialized in front of me

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.943
as if they'd been bottled up inside me

00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:47.917
for many, many years.

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:50.412
One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.341
of people I'd known,

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.643
and they become characters

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:55.980
in a kind of three-dimensional drama,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.340
where they explain who they are, what they do,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.399
their hopes and their fears for the future.
