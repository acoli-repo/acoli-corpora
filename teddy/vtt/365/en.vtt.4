00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.121
I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.219
to work in the shipyard.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.951
I'd watch those same men

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.651
walking back home every night.

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:08.543
It has to be said, the shipyard was not

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:12.319
the most pleasant place to live next door to,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.419
or indeed work in.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.895
The shipyard was noisy, dangerous,

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.911
highly toxic,

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.407
with an appalling health and safety record.

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:26.575
Despite that, the men and women

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.225
who worked on those ships

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.117
were extraordinarily proud of the work they did,
