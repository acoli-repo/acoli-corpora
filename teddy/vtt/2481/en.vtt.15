00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.296
I stopped loving work.
I couldn't restart the engine.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.296
The hum would not come back.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.640
My hum was broken.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.296
I was doing the same things
I always did, all the same titan work,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.776
15-hour days, working
straight through the weekends,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.136
no regrets, never surrender,
a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.360
full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.520
But there was no hum.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.600
Inside me was silence.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.776
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.016
sometimes four.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.856
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time ...
