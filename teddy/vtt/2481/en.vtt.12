00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.296
I don't know.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.136
I just know that
I'm not built for failure,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.000
and I just know that I love the hum.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.096
I just know that I want
to tell you I'm a titan,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.576
and I know that

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.896
the more successful I become,

the more barriers broken,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.040
the more work there is to do,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.016
the more balls in the air,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.936
the more eyes on me,
the more history stares,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.720
the more expectations there are.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.376
The more I work to be successful,
