00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.296
(Laughter)

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.480
It's all peace and simplicity.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.096
The air is so rare in this place for me
that I can barely breathe.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.280
I can barely believe I'm breathing.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.600
Play is the opposite of work.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.920
And I am happy.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.056
Something in me loosens.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.400
A door in my brain swings open,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.816
and a rush of energy comes.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.096
And it's not instantaneous,
but it happens, it does happen.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.320
I feel it.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.920
A hum creeps back.
