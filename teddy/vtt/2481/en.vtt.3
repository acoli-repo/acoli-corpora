00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
I say yes, every single time.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.896
Almost. I'm not perfect at it,
but I try hard to practice it.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.336
And it's had a magical effect on me,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.760
on my children, on our family.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.456
But it's also had a stunning side effect,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.056
and it wasn't until recently
that I fully understood it,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.656
that I understood that saying yes
to playing with my children

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
likely saved my career.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.896
See, I have what most people
would call a dream job.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.696
I'm a writer. I imagine.
I make stuff up for a living.
