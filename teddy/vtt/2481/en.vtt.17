00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.336
"Cry me a river,
stupid writer titan lady."

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.135
(Laughter)

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.216
But you know, you do,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.015
if you make, if you work,
if you love what you do,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.096
being a teacher, being a banker,
being a mother, being a painter,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.336
being Bill Gates,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.696
if you simply love another person
and that gives you the hum,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.296
if you know the hum,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.336
if you know what the hum feels like,
if you have been to the hum,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.400
when the hum stops, who are you?

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.840
What are you?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.176
What am I?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.080
Am I still a titan?
