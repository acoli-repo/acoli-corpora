Around the world, my shows air
in 256 territories in 67 languages

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.656
for an audience of 30 million people.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360
My brain is global,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.216
and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV
are shows I personally created

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.696
and not just produced,
so on top of everything else,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.256
I need to find time,
real quiet, creative time,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.456
to gather my fans around the campfire

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.720
and tell my stories.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.113
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:23.856
three shows in production at a time,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.920
sometimes four, 350 million dollars,
campfires burning all over the world.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.200
You know who else is doing that?
