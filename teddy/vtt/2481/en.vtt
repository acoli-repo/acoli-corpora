00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.616
So a while ago, I tried an experiment.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.080
For one year, I would say yes
to all the things that scared me.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.056
Anything that made me nervous,
took me out of my comfort zone,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.840
I forced myself to say yes to.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.015
Did I want to speak in public?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.720
No, but yes.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.176
Did I want to be on live TV?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
No, but yes.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.296
Did I want to try acting?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.376
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.456
And a crazy thing happened:

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.216
the very act of doing
the thing that scared me
