00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.736
they assume that I'm talking
about the writing,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.216
that my writing brings me joy.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.560
And don't get me wrong, it does.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.600
But the hum --

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.656
it wasn't until I started
making television

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.896
that I started working, working and making

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.536
and building and creating
and collaborating,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.000
that I discovered this thing,
this buzz, this rush, this hum.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.816
The hum is more than writing.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.096
The hum is action and activity.
The hum is a drug.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.736
The hum is music.
The hum is light and air.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.120
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.
