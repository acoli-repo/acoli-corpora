00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.080
Am I still a titan?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.840
If the song of my heart ceases to play,
can I survive in the silence?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.080
And then my Southern waitress toddler
asks me a question.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.816
I'm on my way out the door,
I'm late, and she says,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.120
"Momma, wanna play?"

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.216
And I'm just about to say no,
when I realize two things.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.840
One, I'm supposed
to say yes to everything,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.680
and two, my Southern waitress
didn't call me "honey."

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.840
She's not calling everyone
"honey" anymore.
