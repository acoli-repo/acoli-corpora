00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.016
so you'll hear me when I say

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.520
that I understand that a dream job
is not about dreaming.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.416
It's all job, all work, all reality,
all blood, all sweat, no tears.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.240
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.176
When I'm hard at work,
when I'm deep in it,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.696
there is no other feeling.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.176
For me, my work is at all times
building a nation out of thin air.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.976
It is manning the troops.
It is painting a canvas.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.656
It is hitting every high note.
It is running a marathon.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.296
It is being Beyoncé.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.240
And it is all of those things
at the same time.
