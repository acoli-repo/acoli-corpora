00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.736
The real hum is confidence and peace.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.256
The real hum ignores the stare of history,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.296
and the balls in the air,
and the expectation, and the pressure.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.880
The real hum is singular and original.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.536
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.936
but maybe God was whispering
the wrong words,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.818
because which one of the gods
was telling me I was the titan?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.000
It's just love.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.896
We could all use a little more love,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.280
a lot more love.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.440
Any time my child asks me to play,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.240
I will say yes.
