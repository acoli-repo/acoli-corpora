00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.336
(Laughter)

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.336
You only need 15 minutes.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.136
My two- and four-year-old
only ever want to play with me

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.576
for about 15 minutes or so

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.616
before they think to themselves
they want to do something else.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.216
It's an amazing 15 minutes,
but it's 15 minutes.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.216
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy,
I'm invisible after 15 minutes.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.256
(Laughter)

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.016
And my 13-year-old, if I can get
a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.376
I'm Parent of the Year.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.056
(Laughter)

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.816
15 minutes is all you need.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.480
I can totally pull off 15 minutes
of uninterrupted time on my worst day.
