00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.936
The budget for one episode
of network television

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.336
can be anywhere
from three to six million dollars.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.616
Let's just say five.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.096
A new episode made every nine days
times four shows,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.176
so every nine days that's
20 million dollars worth of television,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.176
four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.656
three shows in production at a time,
sometimes four,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.376
16 episodes going on at all times:

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.776
24 episodes of "Grey's,"
21 episodes of "Scandal,"

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.056
15 episodes of
"How To Get Away With Murder,"

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.456
10 episodes of "The Catch,"
that's 70 hours of TV,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.416
that's 350 million dollars for a season.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.976
In America, my television shows

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.016
are back to back to back
on Thursday night.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.816
Around the world, my shows air
in 256 territories in 67 languages
