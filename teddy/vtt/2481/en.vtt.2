I have these three amazing daughters,
Harper, Beckett and Emerson,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.256
and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably
refers to everyone as "honey."

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.136
as though she's a Southern waitress.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.376
(Laughter)

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.216
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk
for my sippy cup."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.856
(Laughter)

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.136
The Southern waitress asked me
to play with her one evening

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.936
when I was on my way somewhere,
and I said, "Yes."

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.976
And that yes was the beginning
of a new way of life for my family.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.976
I made a vow that from now on,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.336
every time one of my children
asks me to play,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.896
no matter what I'm doing
or where I'm going,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
I say yes, every single time.
