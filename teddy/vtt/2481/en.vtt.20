00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.136
And yet, it is extraordinary,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.656
because in my pain and my panic,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.736
in the homelessness of my humlessness,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.320
I have nothing to do but pay attention.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.176
I focus.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.400
I am still.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.536
The nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.520
the troops, the canvas,
the high note does not exist.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.336
All that exists are sticky fingers

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.696
and gooey kisses
and tiny voices and crayons

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.296
and that song about letting go

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.336
of whatever it is that Frozen girl
needs to let go of.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.296
