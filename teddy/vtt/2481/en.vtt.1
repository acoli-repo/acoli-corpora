00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.216
the very act of doing
the thing that scared me

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.896
undid the fear,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.456
made it not scary.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.920
My fear of public speaking,
my social anxiety, poof, gone.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.576
It's amazing, the power of one word.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.736
"Yes" changed my life.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.456
"Yes" changed me.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.856
But there was one particular yes

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.816
that affected my life
in the most profound way,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.656
in a way I never imagined,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.320
and it started with a question
from my toddler.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.736
I have these three amazing daughters,
Harper, Beckett and Emerson,
