00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.016
to support actual conservation action.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.016
Our first tapir program

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.296

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.456
in the eastern part of Brazil,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.856
one of the most threatened
biomes in the world.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.056
The destruction of the Atlantic Forest

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.296

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.096
when the Portuguese
first arrived in Brazil,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.536
beginning European colonization
in the eastern part of South America.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.856
This forest was almost completely cleared

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.096
for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching
and the construction of cities,
