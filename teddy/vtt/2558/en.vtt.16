00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.616
And somehow, tapirs are still there,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.056
which gives me a lot of hope.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.576
But I have to say that starting
this new program in the Cerrado

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.456
was a bit of a slap in the face.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.936
When you drive around

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.776
and you find dead tapirs
along the highways

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.816
and signs of tapirs wandering around
in the middle of sugarcane plantations

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.856
where they shouldn't be,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.096
and you talk to kids and they tell you
that they know how tapir meat tastes

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.496
because their families poach and eat them,
