00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.136
We really came to a point
in the conservation world

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.896
where we have to think out of the box.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.656
We'll have to be a lot more creative
than we are right now.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.576
And I told you, roadkill is a big problem
for tapirs in the Cerrado,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.016
so we just came up with the idea
of putting reflective stickers

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.856
on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.216
These are the same stickers
used on big trucks

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.856
to avoid collision.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.096
Tapirs cross the highways after dark,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.296
so the stickers will hopefully
help drivers see this shining thing
