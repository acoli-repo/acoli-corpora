This is the largest continuous
freshwater floodplain in the world,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.056
an incredible place

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.736
and one of the most important strongholds
for lowland tapirs in South America.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.256
And working in the Pantanal
has been extremely refreshing

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.256
because we found large,
healthy tapir populations in the area,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.216
and we have been able to study tapirs

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.976
in the most natural conditions
we'll ever find,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.840
very much free of threats.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.976
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,
we are using another technique:
