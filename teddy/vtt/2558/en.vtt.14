In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,
we are using another technique:

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.216
camera traps.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.136
This camera is equipped
with a movement sensor

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.176
and it photographs animals
when they walk in front of it.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.656
So thanks to these amazing devices,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.896
we have been able
to gather precious information

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.856
about tapir reproduction
and social organization

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.416
which are very important
pieces of the puzzle

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.536
when you're trying to develop
those conservation strategies.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.256
And right now, 2015,
we are expanding our work once again

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.136
to the Brazilian Cerrado,
