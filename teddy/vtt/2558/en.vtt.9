00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.176
And then next we have to provide
training, capacity building.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.656
It is our responsibility to prepare
the conservationists of the future.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.736
We are losing several
conservation battles,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.216
and we need more people doing what we do,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.616
and they need the skills,
and they need the passion to do that.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.176
Ultimately, we conservationists,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.816
we must be able to apply our data,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.056
to apply our accumulated knowledge

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.016
to support actual conservation action.
