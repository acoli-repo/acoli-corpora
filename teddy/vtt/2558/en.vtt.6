00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.176
and it was a pioneer research
and conservation program.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.536
At that point, we had nearly
zero information about tapirs,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.856
mostly because they're
so difficult to study.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.416
They're nocturnal, solitary,
very elusive animals,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.616
and we got started getting
very basic data about these animals.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.496
But what is it
that a conservationist does?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.776
Well, first, we need data.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.376
We need field research.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.016
We need those long-term datasets
to support conservation action,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.056
and I told you tapirs
are very hard to study,
