00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.936
This is the lowland tapir,
the tapir species I work with,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.096
the largest terrestrial mammal
of South America.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.656
They're massive. They're powerful.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.216
Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.336
That's half the size of a horse.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.176
They're gorgeous.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.096
Tapirs are mostly found
in tropical forests such as the Amazon,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.576
and they absolutely need
large patches of habitat

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.136
in order to find all the resources
they need to reproduce and survive.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.096
But their habitat is being destroyed,
