Next, we must disseminate what we learn.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.136
We have to educate people about tapirs

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.776
and how important these animals are.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.416
And it's amazing
how many people around the world

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.256
do not know what a tapir is.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.480
In fact, many people think
this is a tapir.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.416
Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.856
(Laughter)

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.816
This is a giant anteater.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.360
Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.
