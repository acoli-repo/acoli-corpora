They play this major role
in shaping and maintaining

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.136
the structure and diversity of the forest,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.296
and for that reason, tapirs are known
as gardeners of the forest.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.056
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.896
If you think about it,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.976
the extinction of tapirs
would seriously affect

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.896
biodiversity as a whole.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.816
I started my tapir work in 1996,
still very young, fresh out of college,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.176
and it was a pioneer research
and conservation program.
