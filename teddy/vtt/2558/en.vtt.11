00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.096
for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching
and the construction of cities,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.576
and today only seven percent
of the Atlantic forest

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.776
is still left standing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.176
And tapirs are found in very, very small,
isolated, disconnected populations.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.856
In the Atlantic Forest, we found out
that tapirs move through open areas

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.216
of pastureland and agriculture

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.456
going from one patch of forest
to patch of forest.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.016
So our main approach in this region

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.416
was to use our tapir data
to identify the potential places
