00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.136
and it has been absolutely amazing.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.656
But at the moment,
I've been thinking really, really hard

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.096
about the impact of my work.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.216
I've been questioning myself
about the real contributions I have made

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.776
for the conservation
of these animals I love so much.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.656
Am I being effective

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.656
in safeguarding their survival?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.016
Am I doing enough?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.336
I guess the big question here is,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.736
am I studying tapirs
and contributing to their conservation,
