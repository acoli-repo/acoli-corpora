00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.096
But their habitat is being destroyed,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.616
and they have been hunted out of several
parts of their geographic distribution.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.376
And you see, this is
very, very unfortunate

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.776
because tapirs are extremely important
for the habitats where they are found.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.176
They're herbivores.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.536
Fifty percent of their diet
consists of fruit,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.456
and when they eat the fruit,
they swallow the seeds,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.096
which they disperse throughout
the habitat through their feces.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.656
They play this major role
in shaping and maintaining
