00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.056
and I told you tapirs
are very hard to study,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.016
so we have to rely
on indirect methods to study them.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.736
We have to capture and anesthetize them

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.216
so that we can install GPS collars
around their necks

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.896
and follow their movements,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.336
which is a technique used by many
other conservationists around the world.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.296
And then we can gather information
about how they use space,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.376
how they move through the landscape,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.376
what are their priority habitats,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.456
and so much more.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.416
Next, we must disseminate what we learn.
