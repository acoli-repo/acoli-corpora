00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.416
was to use our tapir data
to identify the potential places

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.416
for the establishment
of wildlife corridors

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.096
in between those patches of forest,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.176
reconnecting the habitat

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.936
so that tapirs and many other animals
could cross the landscape safely.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.696
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.736
in 2008, we expanded our tapir
conservation efforts to the Pantanal

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.736
in the western part of Brazil

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.136
near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.576
This is the largest continuous
freshwater floodplain in the world,
