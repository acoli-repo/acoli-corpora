00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.136
I know in my heart

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.096
that tapir conservation is my cause.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.816
This is my passion.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.376
I am not alone.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.136
I have this huge network
of supporters behind me,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.176
and there is no way
I'm ever going to stop.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.576
I will continue doing this,
most probably for the rest of my life.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.896
And I'll keep doing this
for Patrícia, my namesake,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.696
one of the first tapirs we captured
and monitored in the Atlantic Forest

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.816
many, many years ago;

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.376
for Rita and her baby Vincent
in the Pantanal.
