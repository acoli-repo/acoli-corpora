because their families poach and eat them,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.760
it really breaks your heart.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.256
The situation in the Cerrado
made me realize --

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.216
it gave me the sense of urgency.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.535
I am swimming against the tide.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.216
It made me realize that despite
two decades of hard work

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.776
trying to save these animals,
we still have so much work to do

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.856
if we are to prevent them
from disappearing.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.816
We have to find ways
to solve all these problems.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.696
We really do, and you know what?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.136
We really came to a point
in the conservation world
