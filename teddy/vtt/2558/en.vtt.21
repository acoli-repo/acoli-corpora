00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.376
for Rita and her baby Vincent
in the Pantanal.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.496
And I'll keep doing this for Ted,
a baby tapir we captured

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.936
in December last year
also in the Pantanal.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.056
And I will keep doing this

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.736
for the hundreds of tapirs
that I've had the pleasure to meet

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.976
over the years

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.536
and the many others I know
I will encounter in the future.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.896
These animals deserve to be cared for.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.896
They need me. They need us.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.896
And you know? We human beings
deserve to live in a world
