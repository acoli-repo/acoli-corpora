00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:31.849
you have not only been verbally ironic,

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.144
but sarcastic as well.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.354
Beware, though.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.525
While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.069
not all verbal irony is sarcastic.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.363
Verbal irony is where what is meant

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.844
is the opposite of what is said,

00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:50.284
while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude.

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:51.263
There are times, though,

00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:53.847
where another layer of meaning can be present

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.877
without that sarcastic tone.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.576
Alright, now go out there

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:02.594
and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm.
