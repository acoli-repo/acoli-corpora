00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:30.413
When a speaker then goes the step farther

00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:32.089
to mean the opposite of what he says

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:35.294
and seeks to be a little pointed and mean,

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.137
like he's making fun of something,

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.797
then you have sarcasm.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.465
Take the second example:

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:41.548
"Awesome job!"

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:43.954
Someone accomplishing his life-long dream:

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:44.748
awesome!

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:46.810
Someone winning a sports championship:

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.667
awesome!

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.047
Someone rear-ends another car:

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:52.724
not awesome.

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:56.441
So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!"

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.969
they probably mean the opposite

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.191
with a hint of poking fun.
