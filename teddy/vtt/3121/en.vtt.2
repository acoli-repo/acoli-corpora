00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.400
I was searching for.

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:02.988
Many years later,

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:05.728
I couldn't bear the thought
of my son turning 13

00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:08.537
without some kind of rite of passage.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.815
So I came up with the idea
of a 13th birthday trip,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.347
and I offered to take Murphy
anywhere in the world

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.729
that had meaning for him.

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:20.296
A budding young naturalist
who loved turtles,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.436
he immediately settled on the Galapagos.

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:26.033
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13,

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:29.396
she and I spent two weeks
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.991
where Katie learned for the first time
that she was powerful and brave.
