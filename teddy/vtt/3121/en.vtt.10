00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.211
and for the first time in human history,

00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:03.999
it's common for four generations
to be living side by side.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.254
I'm 71,

00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:08.214
and with a bit of luck,

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:10.639
I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me.

00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.427
Giving away my stuff now

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:19.481
and sharing it with friends, family,
and I hope strangers, too,

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:23.509
seems like the perfect way
to enter this next stage of my life.

00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:26.789
Turns out to be just
what I was looking for:

00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:29.859
a ritual that's less about dying

00:05:29.883 --> 00:05:31.826
and more about opening the door
