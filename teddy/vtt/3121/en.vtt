00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.494
I grew up white, secular and middle class

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:06.190
in 1950s America.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.920
That meant watching fireworks
on the Fourth of July,

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:12.548
trick-or-treating on Halloween

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:14.799
and putting presents
under a tree at Christmas.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.978
But by the time
those traditions got to me,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.203
they were hollow, commercial enterprises,

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:22.119
which just left me feeling empty.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.900
So from a relatively young age,

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.753
I found myself looking to fill
an existential hole,

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:30.874
to connect with something
bigger than myself.
