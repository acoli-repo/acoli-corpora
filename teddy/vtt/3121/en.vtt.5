"Death cleaning" is the Swedish term
for clearing out your closets,

00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:36.294
your basement and your attic
before you die,

00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:38.447
so your kids don't have to do it later.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.398
(Laughter)

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:43.825
I pictured my children
opening up box after box

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.319
and wondering why I'd kept
any of that stuff.

00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:48.548
(Laughter)

00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:51.980
And then I imagined them looking
at a specific picture

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.495
of me with a beautiful young woman,

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.552
and asking, "Who on earth
is that with Dad?"

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.972
(Laughter)

00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:01.024
And that was the aha moment.
