00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:30.874
to connect with something
bigger than myself.

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.315
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah
in my family in over a century,

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.290
so I thought I'd take a shot at that --

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:38.628
(Laughter)

00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:42.059
only to be devastated
when my one encounter with the rabbi,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:46.830
a really tall, godlike figure
with flowing white hair,

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.731
consisted of him asking me
for my middle name

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:51.426
so we could fill out a form.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.414
Yep, that was it.

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:54.501
(Laughter)

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:56.339
So I got the fountain pen,

00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:59.215
but I didn't get the sense
of belonging and confidence

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.400
I was searching for.
