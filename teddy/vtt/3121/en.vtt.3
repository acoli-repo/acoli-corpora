have taken their kids
on 13th birthday trips,

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.606
with everyone finding it transformative
for both the child and the parent.

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:50.798
I wasn't brought up saying grace.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.312

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.294
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.609
that brings us all together in the moment.
