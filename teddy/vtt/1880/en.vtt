I love paper, and I love technology,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.877
and what I do is I make paper interactive.

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.330
And that's what I say when
people ask me what I do,

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:12.229
but it really confuses most people,

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:14.408
so really, the best way
for me to convey it

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:17.420
is to take the technology and be creative

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:19.521
and create experiences.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.773
So I tried to think
what I could use for here,

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.893
and a couple of weeks
ago I had a crazy idea

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:27.706
that I wanted to print two DJ decks

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.190
and to try and mix some music.
