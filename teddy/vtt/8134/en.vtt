00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:05.084
When we think of our modern-day,
successful entrepreneurs

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.086
and corporate leaders,

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:09.005
the thing they all have in common

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:13.134
is they excel at the general
cut and thrust of business:

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:15.261
outsmarting the competition,

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:17.305
growing the bottom line,

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.058
creating a superior product or service.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.936
But to become a business rock star,

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:28.232
that rarefied category of a name
we all know and admire,

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:29.984
you need something else.
