00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.319
It's like we've ripped the humanity
out of our companies.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.313
Now, we don't do that --
conveniently reduce something

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.521
to a set of numbers that you
can play with like Lego toys --

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.869
we don't do that in our individual life.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.072
We don't treat somebody or value them

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:49.213
based on their monthly income 
or their credit score,

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.020
but we have this double standard

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.565
when it comes to the way
that we value our businesses,

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:55.050
and you know what?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.215
It's threatening the very
underpinnings of our society.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.817
And here's how you'll see.
