00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.274
Now, we're not going
to change corporate behavior

00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:35.591
by simply increasing corporate
philanthropy or charitable contributions.

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.725
And oh, by the way,
we've since quadrupled that,

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:42.974
but -- (Applause) -- Please.

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:46.713
But we can do it by driving
more just behavior.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.754
And one way to do it is actually trusting

00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:52.169
the system that got us
here in the first place,

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.282
and that's the free market system.

00:05:54.282 --> 00:05:56.975
About a year ago,
some friends of mine and I

00:05:56.975 --> 00:06:00.025
started a not-for-profit
called Just Capital.
