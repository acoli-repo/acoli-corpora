What they actually do is they
exacerbate income inequality,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.166
and that's not a good thing.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.627
But intuitively, that makes sense, right?

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:42.250
Because if the top 10 percent
of American families

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.610
own 90 percent of the stocks,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.571
as they take a greater share
of corporate profits,

00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.514
then there's less wealth left
for the rest of society.

00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:54.300
Again, income inequality
is not a good thing.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.761
This next chart,

00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.614

to Japan to New Zealand.
