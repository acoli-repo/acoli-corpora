00:06:57.577 --> 00:07:01.850
At Just Capital, we don't know,
and it's not for us to decide.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.846
We're but messengers,

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.956
but we have 100 percent confidence 
and faith in the American public

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.190
to get it right.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.410
So we'll release the findings
this September for the first time,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.850
and then next year, we'll poll again,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.149
and we'll take the additive step this time

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.168
of ranking the 1,000
largest U.S. companies

00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:25.720
from number one to number 1,000
and everything in between.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.551
We're calling it the Just Index,

00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:33.800
and remember, we're an independent
not-for-profit with no bias,
