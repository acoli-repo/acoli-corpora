00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.115
and one consistent takeaway is
manias never end well.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:03.581
Now, over the past 50 years,

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:09.432
we as a society have come to view
our companies and corporations

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:14.238
in a very narrow, almost
monomaniacal fashion

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:18.255
with regard to how we value them,

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.924
and we have put
so much emphasis on profits,

00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:24.710
on short-term quarterly
earnings and share prices,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.550
at the exclusion of all else.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.319
It's like we've ripped the humanity
out of our companies.
