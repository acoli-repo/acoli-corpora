"Oh wow, what does my company,
what does Tudor do?"

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.693
And I realized we give one percent
of corporate profits

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:09.423
to charity every year.

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:13.324
And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:19.623
When I realized that, I literally
wanted to throw up.

00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:22.101
But the point is, this mania
is so deeply entrenched

00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:27.263
that well-intentioned people like myself
don't even realize that we're part of it.

00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.274

to change corporate behavior
