00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.614
shows 21 countries from Austria
to Japan to New Zealand.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.818
On the horizontal axis
is income inequality.

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:08.116
The further to the right you go,
the greater the income inequality.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:11.459
On the vertical axis
are nine social and health metrics.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.222
The more you go up that,
the worse the problems are,

00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:19.470
and those metrics include life expectancy,
teenage pregnancy, literacy,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.210
social mobility, just to name a few.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.391
Now, those of you in the audience
who are Americans may wonder,

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.736
well, where does the United States rank?

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.593
Where does it lie on that chart?

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.288
And guess what?
