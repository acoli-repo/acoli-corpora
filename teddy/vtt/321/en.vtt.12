00:05:56.975 --> 00:06:00.025
started a not-for-profit
called Just Capital.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:01.493
Its mission is very simple:

00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.988
to help companies and corporations

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:09.263
learn how to operate in a more just
fashion by using the public's input

00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:15.574
to define exactly what the criteria are
for just corporate behavior.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.989
Now, right now, there's
no widely accepted standard

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.331
that a company or corporation can follow,
and that's where Just Capital comes in,

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:27.651
because beginning this year and every year
we'll be conducting a nationwide survey

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.781
of a representative sample
of 20,000 Americans
