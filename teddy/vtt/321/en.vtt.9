WEBVTT

00:04:28.337 --> 00:04:30.636
is so deeply entrenched

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.167
that we don't even realize
how we're harming society.

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:37.184
Here's a small but startling example
of exactly how we're doing that:

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:40.247
this chart shows corporate giving

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:45.632
as a percentage of profits, 
not revenues, over the last 30 years.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:51.401
Juxtapose that to the earlier chart
of corporate profit margins,

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:55.528
and I ask you, does that feel right?

00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:59.699
In all fairness, when I
started writing this, I thought,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.160
"Oh wow, what does my company,
what does Tudor do?"
