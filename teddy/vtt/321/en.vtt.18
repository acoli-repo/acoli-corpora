00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.573
my mama used to always
sigh and shake her head and say,

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:05.630
"Have mercy, have mercy."

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.181
Now's not the time for us,
for the rest of us to show them mercy.

00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:13.370
The time is now for us
to show them fairness,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.846
and we can do that, you and I,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:21.100
by starting where we work,
in the businesses that we operate in.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.460
And when we put justness
on par with profits,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.408
we'll get the most wonderful thing
in all the world.

00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:31.774
We'll take back our humanity.
