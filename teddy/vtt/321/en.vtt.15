the American public a voice.

00:07:38.953 --> 00:07:43.156
And maybe over time, we'll find out
that as people come to know

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.176
which companies are the most just,

00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:49.216
human and economic resources
will be driven towards them,

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:51.190
and they'll become the most prosperous

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.021
and help our country
be the most prosperous.

Now, capitalism has been responsible
for every major innovation

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:03.608
that's made this world a more inspiring
and wonderful place to live in.
