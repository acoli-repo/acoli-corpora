00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:32.360
Fortunately, I was good enough
that by the time I was 30,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.020
I was able to move into the upstairs 
world of money management,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.572
where I spent the next three decades
as a global macro trader.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.846
And over that time, I've seen
a lot of crazy things in the markets,

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:47.529
and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.638
And unfortunately,

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.938
I'm sad to report that right now 
we might be in the grips

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:56.894
of one of the most disastrous,
certainly of my career,

00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.115
and one consistent takeaway is
manias never end well.
