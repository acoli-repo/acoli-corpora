00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.288
And guess what?

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:33.370
We're literally off the chart.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.793
Yes, that's us,

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:37.952
with the greatest income inequality

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:42.248
and the greatest social problems,
according to those metrics.

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.802
Now, here's a macro forecast
that's easy to make,

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:48.401
and that's, that gap between
the wealthiest and the poorest,

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.421
it will get closed.

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:52.010
History always does it.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.159
It typically happens in one of three ways:

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.560
either through revolution,
higher taxes, or wars.
