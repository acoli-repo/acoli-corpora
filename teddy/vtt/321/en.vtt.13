00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.781
of a representative sample
of 20,000 Americans

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:34.701
to find out exactly what they think

00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.579
are the criteria for justness
in corporate behavior.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.591
Now, this is a model that's going
to start in the United States

00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:44.226
but can be expanded
anywhere around the globe,

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:46.107
and maybe we'll find out

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:48.975
that the most important
thing for the public

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:54.326
is that we create living wage jobs,
or make healthy products,

00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:57.577
or help, not harm, the environment.

00:06:57.577 --> 00:07:01.850
At Just Capital, we don't know,
and it's not for us to decide.
