00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:02.836
I've moved about 20 times in my life.

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:06.996
And each time that I move to a new
neighborhood, a new city, a new country,

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:10.836
it seems to get harder and harder
to sustain the friendships I left behind.

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:11.996
But right now,

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:14.916
sustaining those friendships
seems especially important

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:16.716
and especially difficult.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.076
So I'm wondering what is manageable?

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:22.836
How can I keep those friendships afloat
without getting overwhelmed?

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:25.396
