00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So a couple of years ago I started a program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to try to get the rockstar tech and design people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to take a year off

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and work in the one environment

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we have them work in government.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The program is called Code for America,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We select a few fellows every year

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we have them work with city governments.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,
