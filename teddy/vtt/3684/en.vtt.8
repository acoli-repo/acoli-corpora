00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:01.268
Many want to be part of this.

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:04.018
There's an opportunity
to scale this up, dramatically.

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:05.309
And fast.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:09.559
TNC has identified 20 more nations
where such a plan should be possible.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.476
But to execute, they need seed capital.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.684
And to put in place local teams
who can develop conservation plans,

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:17.309
work with all the stakeholders
and structure the deals.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.351
If they get the support they need
over the next five years,

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:23.184
they could protect four million
square kilometers of ocean.

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.518
That's 10 Germanies.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.851
This would increase
the amount of protected areas

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.268
in all of the world's oceans

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:29.976
by an incredible 15 percent.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.434
It would allow vast tracks
of the world's coral reefs to replenish
