00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.434
It would allow vast tracks
of the world's coral reefs to replenish

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.393
and give safe harbor to countless species.

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.351
This would be truly incredible.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.101
And it's really just the beginning.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.309
Because there aren't
20 countries in the world

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.518
where this kind of debt
conversion would work.

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:45.809
There are almost 100.

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.976
With this approach, everyone wins.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.268
Governments, local citizens, funders,

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.851
and most importantly, our oceans.

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.625
So in fact, we all win.

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:59.000
Ah, earth's oceans.
