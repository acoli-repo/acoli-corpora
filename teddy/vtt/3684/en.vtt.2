00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.643
Marine protected areas
must also be enforced.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.184
That means the government itself
must be deeply invested in the plan.

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.934
Token support will not cut it.

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.518
And finally, conservation requires money.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:10.809
A lot of it.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.393
Governments in island and coastal nations
may want to protect their waters,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.476
but often these nations
have very high debt

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.018
and can't afford
to prioritize conservation.

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:22.476
If we rely on philanthropic dollars alone
to fund marine protection,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.893
we might get a small
marine-protected area here,

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.184
another little one there.

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.809
But we need more
marine protected areas faster,

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.476
to have lasting impact.
