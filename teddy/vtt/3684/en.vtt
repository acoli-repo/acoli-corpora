00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:02.643
Ah, earth's oceans.

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.875
They are beautiful,
inspiring, life-sustaining.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.000
They are also, as you're probably
quite aware, more or less screwed.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:11.934
In the Seychelles, for example,

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.434
human activities and climate change
have left corals bleached.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:18.018
Overfishing has caused
fish stocks to plummet.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:19.851
Biodiversity is in peril.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.184
So what can we do?

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.851
Well, some form of protection, obviously.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.601
Nature is very resilient.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.809
When marine areas
are strategically protected,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.268
entire ecosystems can bounce back.
