00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.434
it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion
for ocean conservation.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.184
And this is how the work gets done.

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.601
Step one: negotiate the deal.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:38.934
A coastal nation commits to protect
at least 30 percent of its ocean areas.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.143
In exchange, The Nature Conservancy
bring investors, public funders

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:45.226
and international
development organizations

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.059
to the table to restructure
a portion of the nation's debt,

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:51.101
leading to lower interest rates
and longer repayment periods.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.559
Step two: create a marine plan.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:57.268
Simultaneously, The Nature Conservancy
works with marine scientists,

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:59.351
government leaders and local stakeholders

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.684
to create a detailed conservation plan
