00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.268
entire ecosystems can bounce back.

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:33.226
However, creating marine
protected areas isn't easy.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.101
First, you have the issue
of figuring out where to protect.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.226
This coral reef overlaps with that
international fishing route,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.393
intersects with this fish hatchery.

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:43.101
Everything is interconnected.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.476
And marine protection plans
must take into account

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.434
how one area affects another.

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:49.976
Then, there's the issue
of getting everyone on board.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.809
Coastal economies
often rely on fishing and tourism.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.851
If people think they can't do their work,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.434
there's no chance of getting
the local buy-in you need

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.018
for the area to be successful.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.643
Marine protected areas
must also be enforced.
