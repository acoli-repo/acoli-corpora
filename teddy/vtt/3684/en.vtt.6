00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.684
to create a detailed conservation plan

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:04.934
that integrates the needs of the ocean
with the needs of the people.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.476
Step three: activate for longevity.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.476
TNC establishes an independently run
conservation trust fund.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.851
The savings from the debt
restructure goes into it

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.851
to support new marine protected areas.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.101
The trust then holds the government
accountable for its commitments,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.184
ensuring that the Blue Bonds
finance real protection efforts.

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:23.684
Could this plan work?

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.000
It already has.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.958
In 2016, TNC helped create a national
conservation plan in the Seychelles.
