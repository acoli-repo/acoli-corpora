00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.393
to generate the funds and political will

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:03.684
to protect reefs, mangroves and fisheries.

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:06.143
For example, if you refinance your house

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.268
to take advantage
of a better interest rate,

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:10.851
maybe you use the savings
to insulate your attic.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:14.726
That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do
for entire coastal countries.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.018
Refinance the debt,

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:19.059
then use the savings
to create marine protected areas.

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:22.393
Of course, sovereign debt restructuring
is more complicated than that,

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:24.018
but you get the basic idea.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.476
If investors put in
40 million dollars now,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.434
it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion
for ocean conservation.
