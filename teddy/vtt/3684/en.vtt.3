So what exactly does
smart ocean conservation look like?

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.184
How do we get the money,
government support and careful planning

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.684
that takes into account

and complex ecosystems?

to achieve their conservation goals.

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.184
TNC's idea is to restructure this debt,

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.393
to generate the funds and political will
