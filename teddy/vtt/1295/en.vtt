00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was 10 years old,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And as a special treat,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
he took me to the pathology lab

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and took a real human brain

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
out of the jar

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and placed it in my hands.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And there it was,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the seat of human consciousness,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the powerhouse of the human body,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
sitting in my hands.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And that day I knew that when I grew up,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was going to become a brain doctor,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
scientist, something or the other.
