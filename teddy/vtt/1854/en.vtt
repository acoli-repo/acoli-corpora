00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:02.670
I'm here to show you

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.371
how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.

00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:10.174
You're about to experience a new, available

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:13.154
and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.282
how we waterproof our lives.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.002
What I have here is a cinder block

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.498
that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.090
that can be applied to almost any material.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.427
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:27.853
and when you apply it to any material,

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:30.958
it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
