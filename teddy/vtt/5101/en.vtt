In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:14.653
to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine.

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:18.773
On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.569
while the other remained untouched.

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.211
Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps.

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:29.526
The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.386
This shouldn't be surprising,
