00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.684
we're still really at the early stages
of understanding things,

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:33.018
and there's a lot to learn.

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.309
The truth is

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:38.292
that these invisible molecular worlds
are vast and largely unexplored.

00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:41.518
To me, these molecular landscapes

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.934
are just as exciting to explore
as a natural world

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.351
that's visible all around us.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:48.643
Thank you.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:51.792
