00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:03.684
I live in Utah,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.559
a place known for having
some of the most awe-inspiring

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:09.143
natural landscapes on this planet.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:12.643
It's easy to be overwhelmed
by these amazing views,

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:16.518
and to be really fascinated by these
sometimes alien-looking formations.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:20.184
As a scientist, I love
observing the natural world.

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.976
But as a cell biologist,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.809
I'm much more interested
in understanding the natural world

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.042
at a much, much smaller scale.

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.726
I'm a molecular animator,
and I work with other researchers
