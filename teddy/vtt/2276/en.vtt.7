00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:31.976
all seem to act to rip apart structures

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.393
by basically pulling individual proteins
through a central hole.

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.976
When these kinds of proteins
don't work properly,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.726
the types of proteins
that are supposed to get taken apart

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.184
can sometimes stick together and aggregate

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:47.393
and that can give rise
to terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's.

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.434
And now let's take a look at the nucleus,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.393
which houses our genome
in the form of DNA.

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:53.851
In all of our cells,

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:58.184
our DNA is cared for and maintained
by a diverse set of proteins.

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.018
DNA is wound around proteins
called histones,
