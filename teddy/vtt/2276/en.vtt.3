00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.976
to communicate their ideas
of how these molecules work.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.768
They can also allow us
to see the molecular world

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.351
through their eyes.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.309
I'd like to show you some animations,

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.851
a brief tour of what I consider to be
some of the natural wonders

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.559
of the molecular world.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.559
First off, this is an immune cell.

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:48.476
These kinds of cells need to go
crawling around in our bodies

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.518
in order to find invaders
like pathogenic bacteria.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.643
This movement is powered
by one of my favorite proteins

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:55.934
called actin,

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.434
which is part of what's known
as the cytoskeleton.

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.101
Unlike our skeletons,
