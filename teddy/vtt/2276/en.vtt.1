00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.726
I'm a molecular animator,
and I work with other researchers

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.643
to create visualizations
of molecules that are so small,

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.268
they're essentially invisible.

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.143
These molecules are smaller
than the wavelength of light,

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.406
which means that we can
never see them directly,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.476
even with the best light microscopes.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.643
So how do I create
visualizations of things

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.643
that are so small we can't see them?

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.809
Scientists, like my collaborators,

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.934
can spend their entire
professional careers

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.518
working to understand
one molecular process.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:56.018
To do this, they carry out
a series of experiments

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.143
that each can tell us
a small piece of the puzzle.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.934
One kind of experiment
can tell us about the protein shape,
