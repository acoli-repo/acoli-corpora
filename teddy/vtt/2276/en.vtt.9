00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.393
it basically undergoes
a series of shape changes

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:32.518
which enables it to bring in
other machinery

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:36.684
that in turn allows a gene
to get turned on or transcribed.

00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:39.809
This has to be a very
tightly regulated process,

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:42.601
because turning on the wrong gene
at the wrong time

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.268
can have disastrous consequences.

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:48.101
Scientists are now able
to use protein machines

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:49.559
to edit genomes.

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.018
I'm sure all of you have heard of CRISPR.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.851
CRISPR takes advantage
of a protein known as Cas9,

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.809
which can be engineered
to recognize and cut

00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.226
a very specific sequence of DNA.
