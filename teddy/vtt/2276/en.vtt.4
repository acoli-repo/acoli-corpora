Unlike our skeletons,

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.851
actin filaments are constantly
being built and taken apart.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:07.268
The actin cytoskeleton plays
incredibly important roles in our cells.

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.059
They allow them to change shape,

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.476
to move around, to adhere to surfaces

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.934
and also to gobble up bacteria.

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.559
Actin is also involved
in a different kind of movement.

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:19.768
In our muscle cells, actin structures
form these regular filaments

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.309
that look kind of like fabric.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.268
When our muscles contract,
these filaments are pulled together

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:26.309
and they go back
to their original position

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.809
when our muscles relax.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:31.059
Other parts of the cytoskeleton,
in this case microtubules,
