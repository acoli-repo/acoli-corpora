00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.018
DNA is wound around proteins
called histones,

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:05.351
which enable cells to pack
large amounts of DNA into our nucleus.

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.434
These machines
are called chromatin remodelers,

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.184
and the way they work
is that they basically scoot the DNA

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:12.476
around these histones

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.351
and they allow new pieces of DNA
to become exposed.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.309
This DNA can then be recognized
by other machinery.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.851
In this case, this large molecular machine

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.559
is looking for a segment of DNA

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.893
that tells it it's
at the beginning of a gene.

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:27.601
Once it finds a segment,

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.393
it basically undergoes
a series of shape changes
