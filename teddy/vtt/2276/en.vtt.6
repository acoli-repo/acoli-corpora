This particular motor protein
is known as dynein,

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.851
and its known to be able
to work together in groups

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.309
that almost look, at least to me,
like a chariot of horses.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:11.184
As you see, the cell is this incredibly
changing, dynamic place,

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:14.643
where things are constantly
being built and disassembled.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.018
But some of these structures

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:18.143
are harder to take apart
than others, though.

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.101
And special forces need to be brought in

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:23.559
in order to make sure that structures
are taken apart in a timely manner.

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.309
That job is done in part
by proteins like these.

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:27.851
These donut-shaped proteins,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.893
of which there are many types in the cell,

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:31.976
all seem to act to rip apart structures
