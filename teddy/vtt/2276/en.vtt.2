One kind of experiment
can tell us about the protein shape,

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.226
while another can tell us

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.536
about what other proteins
it might interact with,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.465
and another can tell us
about where it can be found in a cell.

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.476
And all of these bits of information
can be used to come up with a hypothesis,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.583
a story, essentially,
of how a molecule might work.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.934
My job is to take these ideas
and turn them into an animation.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.226
This can be tricky,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.476
because it turns out that molecules
can do some pretty crazy things.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.851
But these animations
can be incredibly useful for researchers

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.976
to communicate their ideas
of how these molecules work.
