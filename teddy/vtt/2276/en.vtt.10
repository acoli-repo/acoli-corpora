00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.226
a very specific sequence of DNA.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.518
In this example,

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:05.518
two Cas9 proteins are being used
to excise a problematic piece of DNA.

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:09.018
For example, a part of a gene
that may give rise to a disease.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.519
Cellular machinery is then used

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:14.059
to basically glue two ends
of the DNA back together.

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.351
As a molecular animator,

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:18.684
one of my biggest challenges
is visualizing uncertainty.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:22.018
All of the animations I've shown to you
represent hypotheses,

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.309
how my collaborators think
a process works,

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.684
based on the best information
that they have.

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:28.684
But for a lot of molecular processes,

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.684
we're still really at the early stages
of understanding things,
