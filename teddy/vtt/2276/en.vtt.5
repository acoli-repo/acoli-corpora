Other parts of the cytoskeleton,
in this case microtubules,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.768
are responsible for long-range
transportation.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:36.434
They can be thought of
as basically cellular highways

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.809
that are used to move things
from one side of the cell to the other.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.601
Unlike our roads,
microtubules grow and shrink,

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.059
appearing when they're needed

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.434
and disappearing when their job is done.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.893
The molecular version of semitrucks

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.476
are proteins aptly named motor proteins,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.976
that can walk along microtubules,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.684
dragging sometimes huge cargoes,

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:58.518
like organelles, behind them.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.393
This particular motor protein
is known as dynein,
