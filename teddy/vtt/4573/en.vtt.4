00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:02.162
but the 70% of the world that is
digitally excluded is not part of this.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.353
What does this mean?

00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:07.501
Well, the people that will be digitally
excluded won't be able to compete

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:09.399
in the labor markets of the future,

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:11.847
they won't be connected,
they'll be less informed,

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.110
they'll be less inspired

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:14.768
and they'll be less responsible.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.663
Internet should not be a luxury,
it should be a right,

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.857
because it is a basic social necessity
of the 21st century.

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.714
We can't operate without it.

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:24.996
(Applause)

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.273
Thank you.

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.007
It allows us to connect to the world.

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.196
It empowers us.
