00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:30.837
So it creates a virtuous circle.

00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.466
It allows us to deliver education

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.628
according to different
types of intelligence

00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:36.966
and according to different user needs.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.161
With this in mind,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:44.792
we have to think that technology
is something that can modify

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.450
according to human processes.

00:08:46.888 --> 00:08:48.079
I want to share a story.

00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:50.168
In 2006, I went to live here.

00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:54.130
This is one of the poorest
communities in all of Mexico.

00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.264
I went to film a documentary
on the people that live off trash,

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.921
entirely of trash -- their houses
are built with trash,

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.752
they eat trash, they dress in trash.
