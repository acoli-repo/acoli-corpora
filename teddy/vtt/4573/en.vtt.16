00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:01.401
So, we have four elements:

00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:03.963
we have a space that's created,

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:05.300
we have a connection,

00:08:05.324 --> 00:08:07.317
we have content and we have training.

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.708
We have created
a digital learning community.

00:08:09.732 --> 00:08:11.696
But there is one more element,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.594
which is the benefits
that technology can create,

00:08:16.618 --> 00:08:18.714
because it is not printed, static content.

00:08:18.738 --> 00:08:21.016
It is dynamic; it is modifiable.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.614
So we have we do is, we provide
content, then we do training,

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:29.213
then we analyze the user patterns
so that we can improve content.

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:30.837
So it creates a virtuous circle.
