The digital divide is a mother
that's 45 years old and can't get a job,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.895
because she doesn't know
how to use a computer.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.627
It is an immigrant that doesn't know
that he can call his family for free.

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:14.789
It is a child who can't
resolve his homework,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.017
because he doesn't have
access to information.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.828
The digital divide is a new illiteracy.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.714
"Digital divide" is also defined as:

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.798
the gap between individuals
and communities

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:25.940
that have access
to information technologies

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.117
and those that don't.

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.679
Why does this happen?
It happens because of 3 things.

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.147
The first is that people can't get
access to these technologies
