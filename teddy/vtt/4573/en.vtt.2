00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:02.313
close to five billion people --

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:05.453
do not have access
to a computer or the internet.

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.545
Let's think about
that number for a second.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:12.056
Five billion people; that's four
times the population of India,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.583
that have never touched a computer,
have never accessed the internet.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.116
So this is a digital abyss
that we're talking about,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.739
this is not a digital divide.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.953
Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:24.501
that shows the internet connections
around the world.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:27.249
What we can see is that most
of the internet connections

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.272
are centered on North America and Europe,

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.349
while the rest of the world is engulfed
in the dark shadow of digital divide.
