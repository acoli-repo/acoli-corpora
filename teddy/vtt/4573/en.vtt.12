a little needle to change the city body.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.332
And there we go.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:08.371
And so, there are four basic elements
that we need to consider

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:12.389
when we're using education
through technology.

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:15.317
The first one is we need to create spaces.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.829
We need to create a space
that is welcoming to the community,

00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:24.155
a space that is according to the needs
of the children and of the elders

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:28.229
and of every possible person
that lives within that community.

00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.360
So we create these spaces
that are all made with recycled materials.
