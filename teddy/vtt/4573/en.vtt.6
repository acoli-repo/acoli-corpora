00:02:57.282 --> 00:03:00.360
do we really want children
to take computers to their homes,

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:02.550
homes that have adverse conditions?

00:03:02.574 --> 00:03:05.522
And we also must understand
that by giving a child a computer,

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.181
we're also transferring costs,
very high costs,

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:14.013
such as internet connection, electricity,
maintenance, software, updates.

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.826
So we must create different models,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.427
models that help the families
rather than add a burden on them.

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:23.936
Also, let's not forget
about the carbon footprint.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.230
Imagine five billion laptops.

00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:28.062
What would the world look like then?

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.174
Imagine the hazardous residue
that would be generated from that.
