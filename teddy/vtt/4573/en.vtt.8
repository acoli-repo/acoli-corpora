00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.224
What nation has this amount of money?

00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:02.311
This is not a sustainable model.

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.893
So with this in mind,
we created a different model.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.576
We created the RIA, in Spanish,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.933
or in English, Learning
and Innovation Network,

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:12.172
which is a network of community centers

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.613
that bring education
through the use of technology.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.930
We wanted to increase the number
of users per computer in such a way

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:21.370
that we could dilute the cost
of infrastructure, the cost per user,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.826
and that we could bring
education and technology

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.065
to everybody within these communities.

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:28.987
Let's look at a basic comparison.

00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:32.526
The RIA has 1,650 computers.
