00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.349
while the rest of the world is engulfed
in the dark shadow of digital divide.

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:37.353
Next, we can see connections,
city-to-city, around the world,

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:39.918
and we can see that most
of the information generated

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:43.187
is being generated
between North America and Europe,

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:46.958
while the rest of the world is not
broadcasting their ideas or information.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.213
So what does this mean?

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:53.183
We are living in a world that seems
to be having a digital revolution,

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:58.383
a revolution that everyone here
thinks that we're part of,

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:02.162
but the 70% of the world that is
digitally excluded is not part of this.
