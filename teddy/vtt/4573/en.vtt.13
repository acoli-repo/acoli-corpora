00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.360
So we create these spaces
that are all made with recycled materials.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:37.387
We use modular architecture
to lower the ecological impact.

00:06:37.804 --> 00:06:41.508
And second, connection.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.896
By connection, I mean not only
a connection to the internet,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.096
that's too easy.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.693
We need to create a connection
that's an interconnection of humans.

00:06:49.717 --> 00:06:53.695
The internet is a very complex organism

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:58.818
that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts
and the emotions of human beings.

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:01.856
We need to create networks
that aid in exchanging information.
