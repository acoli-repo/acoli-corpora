00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:01.856
We need to create networks
that aid in exchanging information.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.009
Third, content.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.320
Education is nothing without content.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.607
And you can't pretend
to have a relationship

00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:11.399
of only a computer with a child.

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:16.885
So we create a route,
a very basic learning route,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:18.978
where we teach people
how to use a computer,

00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:21.663
how to use the internet,
how to use office software,

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.082
and in 72 hours,
we create digital citizens.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:28.205
You can't pretend that people
are just going to touch a computer

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.677
and become digitally included,

00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:31.030
you need to have a process.
