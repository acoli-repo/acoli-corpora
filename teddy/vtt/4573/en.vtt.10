00:04:59.948 --> 00:05:01.162
out of which --

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.585
(Applause)

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:03.767
Thank you.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:08.312
out of which, 34,000 have already
graduated from our courses.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:11.606
Another thing with One Laptop per Child
is that it doesn't guarantee

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.294
the educational use of a computer.

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.920
Technology is nothing
without that content.

00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:18.400
We need to use it
as a means, not as an end.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:24.026
How did we accomplish such a high impact?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.287
Well, you can't just go into a community
and pretend to change it,

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.110
you need to look at a lot of factors.

00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:32.067
So what we do is a thing
we call "urban acupuncture."
