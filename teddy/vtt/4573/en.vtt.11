00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:32.067
So what we do is a thing
we call "urban acupuncture."

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.792
We first start by looking
at the basic geography of a site.

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:37.370
So take, for example, Ecatepec.

00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:42.028
This is one of the most densely
populated municipalities in Mexico.

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:45.151
It has a very low income level.

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:48.675
So we look at the basic geography,
we look at roads, streets,

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.293
the flux of pedestrians and vehicles.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.773
Then we look at income,
we look at education.

00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:57.017
Then we set up a center there

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.466
in the place that's going
to heal the body,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.438
a little needle to change the city body.
