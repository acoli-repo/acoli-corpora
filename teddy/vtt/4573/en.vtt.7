00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.174
Imagine the hazardous residue
that would be generated from that.

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:32.426
Imagine the trash.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.816
So if we give one computer to one person,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.743
and we multiply that times five billion,

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:42.847
even if that laptop is a hundred dollars,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:46.660
then we would have 483 trillion dollars.

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:51.827
Now let's consider we're only counting
the youth, ages 10 to 24.

00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.156
That's approximately 30%
of the digitally excluded population.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.513
Then that would be 145 trillion dollars.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.224
What nation has this amount of money?
