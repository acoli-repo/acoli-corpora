00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is me. My name is Ben Saunders.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I specialize in dragging heavy things

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
around cold places.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
On May 11th last year,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was the only human being in an area

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
one-and-a-half times the size of America,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
five-and-a-half thousand square miles.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
12 people have stood on the moon.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Including me, only four people

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have skied solo to the North Pole.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I think the reason for that --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
