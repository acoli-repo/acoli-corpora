00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:02.768
that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:04.995
and turned to writing about biology.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:08.949
As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schrödinger's cat is very real.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:10.610
In fact, it's essential.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.328
If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once,

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:18.575
the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.657
The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.708
is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.844
In order for an object to have
a wavelength,

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:30.299
it must extend over some region of space,
