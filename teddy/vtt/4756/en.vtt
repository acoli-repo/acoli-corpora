Austrian physicist Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.237
but he's most famous for something he
never actually did:

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:17.937
a thought experiment involving a cat.

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.282
He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:26.572
with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour.

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:30.418
At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?"
