00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:30.418
At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?"

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.788
Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.791
but Schrödinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics,

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:42.421
at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead,

00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:44.338
at the same time.

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:48.302
It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:51.561
Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability,

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.230
half one thing and half the other.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.965
This seems absurd, 
which was Schrödinger's point.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.956
He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing,

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:02.768
that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make
