00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.029
This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.491
An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit.

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:07.135
Bring two atoms close together,

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.416
and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:12.203
but are shared between them.

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:14.676
This is how some chemical bonds form.

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:21.059
An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.875
As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more,

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.342
shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time.

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.643
The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom
