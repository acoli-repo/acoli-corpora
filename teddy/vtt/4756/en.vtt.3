WEBVTT

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:30.299
it must extend over some region of space,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.049
which means it occupies many positions
at the same time.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.070
The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.425
can't be perfectly defined, though.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:43.425
So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.459
We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.212
because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:52.910
And a cat is relatively big and heavy.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.129
If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System,

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.653
the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.319
would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System.
