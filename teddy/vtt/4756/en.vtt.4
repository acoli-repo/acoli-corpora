00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.319
would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.044
That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.061
A tiny particle, like an electron, though,


00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:13.398
can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature.

00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:18.602
If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier,

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:23.912
each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant,

00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:25.295
like a particle.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:27.533
But if you repeat this 
experiment many times,

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.360
keeping track of all the 
individual detections,
