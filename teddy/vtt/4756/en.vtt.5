00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.360
keeping track of all the 
individual detections,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.643
you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior:

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.373
a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:40.061
separated by regions
where there are none at all.

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.867
Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:47.692
This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:49.790
at the same time.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.672
A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.076
but left and right simultaneously.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.029
This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology.
