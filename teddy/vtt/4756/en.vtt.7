00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.643
The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:35.344
but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space.

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:37.860
This gigantic superposition of states

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.607
determines the ways electrons move
through the material,

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:45.625
whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.461
Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.947
allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials,

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:53.508
like silicon.

00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:55.919
Combining different semiconductors
in the right way

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.501
allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale,

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.863
millions on a single computer chip.
