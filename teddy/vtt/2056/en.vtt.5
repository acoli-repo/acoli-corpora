00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.336
And what struck me immediately

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.816
was how in love
the two of these people were.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.056
The grandmother was incredibly fond,
deeply in love with this little girl.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.696
They slept on the floor at night.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.176
The way they heat their homes in Korea
is to put bricks under the floors,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.416
so the heat radiates
from underneath the floor.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.776
Eun-Sook was 11 years old.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.216
I had photographed,
as I said, a lot of these kids.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.216
Eun-Sook was the fifth child
that I found to photograph.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.776
And almost universally,
amongst all the kids,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.496
they were really psychologically damaged

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.336
by having been made fun of,
ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.
