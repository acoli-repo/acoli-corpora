00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.336
by having been made fun of,
ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.136
And Korea was probably the place
I found to be the worst for these kids.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.336
And what struck me immediately
in meeting Eun-Sook

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.176
was how confident she appeared to be,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.416
how happy she seemed to be
in her own skin.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.696
And remember this picture,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.176
because I'm going to show you
another picture later.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.376
She looks much like her grandmother,
although she looks so Western.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.056
I decided to follow her to school.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.176
This is the first morning
I stayed with her.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.616
This is on the way to school.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.080
This is the morning assembly
outside her school.
