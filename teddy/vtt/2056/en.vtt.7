00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.336
And I noticed that
she was clowning around.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.216
When the teachers would ask questions,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.656
she'd be the first person
to raise her hand.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.616
Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.376
or anything like the other children
that I'd photographed.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.136
The first one to go
to the blackboard to answer questions.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.096
Getting in trouble for whispering
into her best friend's ears.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.296
And one of the other things
I said to her through the translator --

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.896
again, this thing about saying stop --
was to not pay attention to me.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.736
So she really just completely
ignored me most of the time.
