00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.696
The family had a small shed
on the side of the house,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.896
so I said, "Could I sleep
in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.856
And I just told the little girl,
whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.096
that if I ever did anything
to embarrass her --

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.536
she didn't speak a word of English,
although she looked very American --

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.136
she could put up her hand and say, "Stop,"
and I would stop taking pictures.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.976
Then my translator left.
I couldn't speak a word of Korean.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.936
This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.296
Her mother was still alive.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.016
She was not raising her,
her grandmother was raising her.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.336
And what struck me immediately
