00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.336
And I said, "Look, I think
I'll scare the grandmother to death,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.936
if I tell her that
you're willing to adopt her.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.976
I want to go back and talk to her."
But I was off on assignment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.096
I figured I'd come back
in a couple of weeks

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.496

and left their child in a will to me.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.976
Did I know anything about this?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.096
Because I hadn't told them
what I was doing,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.656
because I was so upset
with the story they'd run.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.056
So, I went back to Korea,
