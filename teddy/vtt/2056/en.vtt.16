And she said, "He says he knows
who you are, what do you want?"

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.016
I said, "Well, tell him that I was asked
by this little girl's grandmother

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.976
to find a family for her."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.240
And he said, "I'm her uncle,
she's fine, you can leave now."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.360
So I was --

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.376
The door was being slammed in my face,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.576
it's incredibly cold,
and I'm trying to think,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.936
So I said, "It's really cold,
I've come a very long way,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.456
do you mind if I come in
for a minute? I'm freezing."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.416
So the guy reluctantly let us in
and we sat down on the floor.
