And I could be wrong, I don't know,
but I wish you would come tomorrow."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.816
So, these two came to lunch
and we got thrown out of the restaurant.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.296
They were yelling at him,
it got to be really ugly.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.273
We went outside, and he was just furious.

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.336
And I knew I had totally blown this thing.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.736
Here I was again,
trying to figure out what to do.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.576
And he started yelling at me,
and I said to the translator,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.616
"Tell him to calm down,
what is he saying?"

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.056
And she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell
are you to walk into my house,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.616
some rich American
with your cameras around your neck,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.336
accusing me of enslaving my niece?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.662
This is my niece, I love her,
she's my sister's daughter.
