00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.096
because we slept on the floor
with all the kids at the orphanage.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.856
And the third night, we came back --

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.656
we'd just gone out to dinner,
where you saw the pictures --

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.896
and we got to the front desk,
and the guy said,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.336
"There's no other free rooms
on your floor tonight,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.456
you can put the kids
five floors below you."

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.616
And Gene and I
looked at each other and said,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.016
"We don't want two 11-year-olds
five floors away."

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.176
So his son said, "I have a sleeping bag,
I'll sleep on the floor."

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.136
And I said, "I have one too."
So Tim and I slept on the floor,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.936
Natasha got one bed,
Gene got the other -- kids pass out,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.856
it's been very exciting for three days.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.376
We're lying in bed, and Gene and I
are talking about how cool we are.
