00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.976
A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.856
and she was a prostitute,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.816
and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.136
And I said to them,
"Look, there's a little girl

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.296
who has a tiny chance
of getting out of here

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.576
and going to America.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.936
I don't know if it's
the right decision or not,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.136
but I would like you
to come to lunch tomorrow

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.896
and tell the uncle what it's like
to walk down the street,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.496
what people say to you,
what you do for a living.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.536
I want him to understand
what happens if she stays here.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.976
And I could be wrong, I don't know,
but I wish you would come tomorrow."
