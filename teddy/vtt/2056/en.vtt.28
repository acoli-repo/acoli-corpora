00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.856
which I understood was from her watching
a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.816
on the American Air Force station.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.896
This may be one
of those myth-buster things

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.096
that we'll have to
clear up here, in a minute.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.416
So, my friend Gene
flew over with his son, Tim.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.976
Gayle couldn't come.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.616
And they spent a lot of time
huddled over a dictionary.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.336
And this was Gene showing the uncle

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.480
where Atlanta was on the map,
where he lived.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.960
This is the uncle
signing the adoption papers.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.256
Now, we went out to dinner
that night to celebrate.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.896
The uncle went back to his family

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.376
and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I
went out to dinner.
