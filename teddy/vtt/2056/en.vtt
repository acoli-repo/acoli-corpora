Some of you have heard the story before,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.136
but, in fact, there's somebody
in the audience

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.016
who's never heard this story
in front of an audience before,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.776
so I'm a little more nervous
than I normally am telling this story.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.896
I used to be a photographer
for many years.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.776
In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.936
and I was given a three-day assignment
to photograph Amerasian children,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.296
children who had been fathered
by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.656
and then abandoned --
40,000 children all over Asia.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.760
I had never heard
the word Amerasian before.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.056
I spent a few days photographing
children in different countries,
