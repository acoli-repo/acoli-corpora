A lot of the kids who had been adopted
wrote back to the other kids,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.376
telling them what their life
was like with their new families.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.016
So it was a really big deal
when the letters showed up.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.496
This is a woman who is
now working at the orphanage,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.806
whose son had been adopted.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.976
Gene and Gayle started studying Korean

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.016
the moment they had gotten
my first letter.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.536
They really wanted to be able
to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.616
And one of the things Father Keane told me

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.656
when I came back
from one of these trips --

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.576
Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.856
which I understood was from her watching
a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon
