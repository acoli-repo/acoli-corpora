00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.056
and actually go spend
some time with the kids,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.296
and try to tell their story
a little bit better

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.480
than I thought I had done
for Time magazine.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.936
In the course of doing the story,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.616
I was looking for children
who hadn't been photographed before,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.576
and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me
that they worked with a lot of Americans

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.016
who were donating money
to help some of these kids.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.296
And a man told me,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.976
who ran the Pearl Buck
Foundation in Korea,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.376
that there was a young girl,
who was 11 years old,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.976
being raised by her grandmother.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.696
And the grandmother
had never let any Westerners see her.
