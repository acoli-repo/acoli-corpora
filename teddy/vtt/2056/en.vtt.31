00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.376
We're lying in bed, and Gene and I
are talking about how cool we are.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.376
We said, "That was so great,
we saved this little girl's life."

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.856
We were just like,
you know, just full of ourselves.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.216
And we fall asleep --

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.816
and I've been in this room
for a couple of months now.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.696
And they always overheat
the hotels in Korea terribly,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.016
so during the day
I always left the window open.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.936
And then about midnight,
they turn the heat off in the hotel.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.256
So at 1am, the whole room would be
like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.496
I'd been doing this
every night I'd been there.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.016
So, sure enough,
it's one o'clock, room's freezing,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.736
I go to close the window
and I hear people shouting outside,
