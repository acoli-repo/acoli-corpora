And the pictures before
were taken in September.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.136
Well, there was
an American Maryknoll priest

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.416
that I had met in the course
of doing the story,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.376
who had 75 children living in his house.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.016
He had three women helping him
take care of these kids.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.296
And so I suggested to the uncle
that we go down and meet Father Keane

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.416
to find out how
the adoption process worked.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.816
Because I wanted him to feel

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.256
like this was all being done

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.640

down to the orphanage.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.240
This is Father Keane.
He's just a wonderful guy.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.336
He had kids from
all over Korea living there,
