00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.376
and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I
went out to dinner.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.256
And Gene was showing Natasha
how to use a knife and fork,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.000
and then Natasha
was returning the utensil lessons.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.856
We went back to our hotel room,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.336
and Gene was showing Natasha
also where Atlanta was.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.336
This is the third night we were in Korea.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.416
The first night we'd gotten a room
for the kids right next to us.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.056
I'd been staying in this room
for about three months --

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.000
it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.976
The second night,
we didn't keep the kids' room,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.096
because we slept on the floor
with all the kids at the orphanage.
