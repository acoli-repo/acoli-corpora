00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.056
I spent a few days photographing
children in different countries,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.336
and like a lot of photographers
and a lot of journalists,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.816
I always hoped that
when my pictures are published,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.216
they might actually
have an effect on a situation,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.776
instead of just documenting it.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.056
So, I was so disturbed by what I saw

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.176
and I was so unhappy
with the article that ran afterwards,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.656
that I decided
I would take six months off.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.096
I was 28 years old.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.856
I decided I would find
six children in different countries,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.056
and actually go spend
some time with the kids,
