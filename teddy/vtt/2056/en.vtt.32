00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.736
I go to close the window
and I hear people shouting outside,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.380
and I thought, "Oh, the bars
must have just gotten out."

00:16:05.404 --> 00:16:07.816
I don't speak Korean,
but I'm hearing these voices,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.320
and I'm not hearing anger,
I'm hearing terror.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.176
So I open the window and I look out,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.936
and there's flames
coming up the side of our hotel,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.656
and the hotel's on fire.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.616
So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.416
and I say, "Don't freak out,
I think the hotel's on fire."

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.136
And now there's smoke and flames
coming by our windows --

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.416
we're on the 11th floor.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.096
So the two of us were just like,
"Oh my God, oh my God."

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.496
So we're trying to get Natasha up,
and we can't talk to her.
