00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.736
So she really just completely
ignored me most of the time.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.976
I noticed that at recess,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.816
she was the girl who picked
the other girls to be on her team.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.816
It was very obvious, from the beginning,
that she was a leader.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.976
This is on the way home.
And that's North Korea up along the hill.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.216
This is up along the DMZ.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.616
They would actually
cover the windows every night,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.176
so that light couldn't be seen,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.736
because the South Korean government
has said for years

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.935
that the North Koreans
may invade at any time.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.256
So the closer you were to North Korea,
the more terrifying it was.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.576
Very often at school,
I'd be taking pictures,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.936
and she would whisper
into her girlfriends' ears,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.776
and then look at me and say, "Stop."
