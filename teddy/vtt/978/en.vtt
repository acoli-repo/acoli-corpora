Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have a studio in London

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that has a particular approach

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to designing buildings.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I was growing up,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I was exposed to making

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and crafts and materials

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and invention on a small scale.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I was there looking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
at the larger scale of buildings

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and finding

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that the buildings that were around me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and that were being designed
