[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.621
I want you to take this journey with me.

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:09.496
Let's set the stage.

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:11.288
It's a Sunday in Baltimore.

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:13.621
There could be kids
in the park Druid Hill.

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:16.079
They're watching dirt bike riders go pass,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.704
do tricks, pop wheelies, do stunts,

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:19.996
they're zipping.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:22.579
If you hear the engines revving,
smell the gasoline,

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.121
you can see the joy
and excitement on their face.

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.746
Someoneâ€™s probably learning
how to fix their dirt bike,

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.496
because the parts
are way too expensive to buy.
