00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:03.190
We are going to take a quick voyage

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.697
over the cognitive history of the 20th century,

00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:08.486
because during that century,

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:11.400
our minds have altered dramatically.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.724
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.798
have altered because the roads are better

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.153
and because of technology.

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:21.122
And our minds have altered, too.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:25.066
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.465
and analyzed that world primarily in terms

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.698
of how much it would benefit them
