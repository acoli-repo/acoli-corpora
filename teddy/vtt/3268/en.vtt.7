In 2006, the "New York Times"
redesigned their "Markets" section,

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:36.254
cutting it down from eight pages
of stock listings

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:39.175
to just one and a half pages
of essential market data.

00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:43.302
We listed performance metrics
for the most common stocks,

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:47.082
but I wanted to help investors
see how the stocks are doing.

00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:49.826
So I added a simple little dot

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.932
to show the current price
relative to its one-year range.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:58.412
At a glance, value investors can pick out
stocks trading near their lows

00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:00.304
by looking for dots to the left.
