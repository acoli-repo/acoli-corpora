00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.977
The point is, graphics can transmit data
with incredible efficiency.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.422
Graphicacy --

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:07.831
the ability to read and write graphics --

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.452
is still in its infancy.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.521
New chart forms will emerge
and specialized dialects will evolve.

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:15.570
Graphics that help us think faster

00:05:15.594 --> 00:05:18.909
or see a book's worth
of information on a single page

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:22.388
are the key to unlocking new discoveries.

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:26.812
Our visual cortex was built
to decode complex information

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:29.416
and is a master at pattern recognition.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.876
Graphicacy enables us
to harness our built-in GPU
