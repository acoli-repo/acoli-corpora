00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.897
They allow us to encode ideas into words

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.634
and quantities into numbers.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.240
Without communication, we'd still
be stuck in the Stone Ages.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:40.612
Although humans have been around
for a quarter million years,

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:43.684
it was only 8,000 years ago
that proto-writings began to surface.

00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:48.619
Nearly 3,000 years later, the first
proper writing systems took shape.

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:56.201
Maps have been around for millennia
and diagrams for hundreds of years,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.059
but representing quantities
through graphics

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.843
is a relatively new development.
