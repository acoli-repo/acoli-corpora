I love it when data can be sculpted
into beautiful shapes.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:38.230
Here, the personal and professional
connections of the women of Silicon Valley

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:40.146
can be woven into arcs,

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.314
same as the collaboration of inventors
birthing patents across the globe

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:47.681
can be mapped.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.189
I've even made charts for me.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.726
I'm a numbers person,
so I rarely win at Scrabble.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.476
I made this diagram to remember
all the two- and three-letter words

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.276
in the official Scrabble dictionary.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.381
