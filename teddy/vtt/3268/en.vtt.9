hundreds of pages covering six decades
of presidential approval data.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.094
I told him the entire book
could be graphed on a single page.

00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:36.498
"Impossible," he said.

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:40.156
And here it is:

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.992
25,000 data points on a single page.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:46.782
At a glance, one sees that most presidents
start with a high approval rating,

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.219
but few keep it.

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:50.498
Events like wars initially boost approval;

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.380
scandals trigger declines.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.594
These major events were annotated
in the graphic but not in the book.

00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.977
The point is, graphics can transmit data
with incredible efficiency.
