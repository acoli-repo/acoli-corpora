00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk about billions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's talk about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
past and future billions.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We know

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that about 106 billion people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have ever lived.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And we know that most of them are dead.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And we also know

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that most of them live or lived in Asia.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And we also know

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that most of them were or are very poor --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
did not live for very long.
