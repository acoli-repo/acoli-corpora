00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.643
There was something
in me that wanted more.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:35.268
There was a misalignment
between the things I did on a daily basis

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:37.583
and the things that I deeply cared about.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.684
And so I decided to quit

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:44.708
and explore the possibility of bringing
this passion into my daily routine.

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.643
And the thing about finding your passion

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.643
is that it's not straightforward.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.601
Even for people with money and degrees,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.333
they still struggle
to identify their passion.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.143
And here I was as a 30-year-old,

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.268
talking about finding my passion
