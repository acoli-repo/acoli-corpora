00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:00.184
And in the simplest definition,

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.684
passion is a collection
of your life experiences

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.583
that give you the deepest
sense of fulfillment.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.292
And to identify your passion,
you need to look inward.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.458
So we use two reflective questions.

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.393
The first question we ask is,

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:18.143
"If you had all the time
and the money in the world,

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.559
what would you spend your time doing?"

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.643
It sounds like a very simple question,

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:25.184
but many people struggle
to answer this question

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:27.976
because they've just
never thought about it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.059
The second question we ask
