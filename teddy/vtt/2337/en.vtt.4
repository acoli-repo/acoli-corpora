00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:00.684
(Laughter)

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.708
Until you get a better offer
or you're asked to retire.

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:07.601
And as a dropout,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.434
I knew that I was
not entitled to anything.

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.875
Every opportunity was a privilege.

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:16.768
And so when I thought about quitting,

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.042
it was a huge risk.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.101
I was given two alternatives,

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.018
which are the most popular in Africa.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:27.500
The first one is sign up for any course
at a vocational institution and do it.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.351
My second option,
settle for any job offer you can get,
