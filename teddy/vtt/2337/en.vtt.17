00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:32.167
And so he seeks to recognize
that ability in him.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.559
When I met Musa,
he was doing all kinds of crafts --

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.393
bags, belts, wallets --

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.934
but it was more of a part-time thing.

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.226
Or sometimes, if he was really broke
and needed to make quick money,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.643
then he would come up
with a design and sell it.

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:48.208
But he had never thought
of it as a business.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.559
We started working with Musa,

00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:54.393
helping him shift his mindset
from a hobby to a business

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:58.143
and beginning to rethink how he can
make products that he could sell

00:08:58.167 --> 00:08:59.667
and even be able to scale.
