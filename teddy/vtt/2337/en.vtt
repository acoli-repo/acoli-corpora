00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:03.976
When you have a job that pays you enough
to cover your basic needs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.684
your bills and even some more to spend,

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:08.726
the assumption is that you'd be happy,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.625
or, even better, fulfilled.

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.893
And it seems unthinkable
when you wake up and say

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:16.708
you're going to leave a job like that
to pursue a passion.

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:20.000
And that was my dilemma six years ago.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.434
I had a comfortable job,
I lived a comfortable life,

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.184
and people expected me to be fulfilled,

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:28.809
but I wasn't.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.643
There was something
in me that wanted more.
