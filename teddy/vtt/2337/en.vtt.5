00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.351
My second option,
settle for any job offer you can get,

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:34.559
no matter the working conditions,

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.018
and do it.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:39.018
That probably explains why we have
so many of our young people

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:41.583
being trafficked
in search of greener pastures.

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.684
I opted for the first option.

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.268
I did look at a couple
vocational institutions

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.851
in the hope that I would find a course
that resonated with my persona,

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.208
my dream and my aspiration.

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.976
I was disappointed to learn that there
was no room for misfits like me

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.292
in these institutions.
