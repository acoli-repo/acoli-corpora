The education system
in many parts of the world

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.184
has been designed
around preselected options

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:09.726
that young people are expected
to fit in or risk becoming misfits.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.851
And so going through school,
I was nurtured and conditioned

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:16.250
to think in the straight line
and stay within the straight line.

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:20.226
But when I dropped out,
I discovered a world of possibilities.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.958
I knew I could be anything,
I could study anything,

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.976
and so I leveraged free online courses.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.101
That's how I built my CV,
got into employment

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.059
and worked for eight years.
