Is passion only for the rich,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.292
or an experience
only the retired can enjoy?

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:39.184
For many of us, we've been led to believe

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.375
that life is a race of survival.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.726
We've been conditioned
to see ourselves as survivors

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.000
that must do everything
in our power to survive.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.059
In Africa, we're nurtured to go
through school, cram and pass,

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.351
in the hope that you get a job after.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:59.268
And if you do, stick at it
no matter how much it sucks.

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:00.684
