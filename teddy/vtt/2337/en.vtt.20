00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:00.601
the things that give us the deepest joy,

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:04.351
and then weave them
into the patterns of our daily routines.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:08.250
In so doing, we cease to work
and we start to live.

00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:13.643
And the thing about living is that
you never have to retire or to resign.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:16.018
(Laughter)

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:21.101
(Applause)

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:24.059
And so as you think about
unlocking potential for ourselves,

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:26.768
for our young people, for our children,

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.268
let's not condition them to look outward

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:31.309
but condition them to look inward
