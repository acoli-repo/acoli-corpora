00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.059
The second question we ask

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:32.018
is, "What makes you happy

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:35.018
or gives you the deepest
sense of fulfillment?"

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.893
Now, you would assume that we all
know what makes us happy,

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:41.268
but it's also interesting to note
that so many people have no idea

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:42.667
what makes them happy,

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:47.101
because they are so busy
going through the routines of life,

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.292
they've never stopped to look inward.

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.809
And so identifying the things
that give us a deep sense of fulfillment

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.684
and the things that give us deep joy

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:59.000
are thoughts that begin to direct us
in the direction of our passion.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.476
And just in case you're wondering
