00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.618
Nathan: My life is tangled.

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:01.792
(Laughter)

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.736
GG: And then he's going to show her
a bunch of pictures

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.281
from four different categories.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.959
Nathan: Face, house, scenery
and weird pictures.

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:11.481
GG: As we show Christy
hundreds of these images,

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.048
we are also capturing the electrical waves
onto Nathan's computer.

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:18.458
We want to see if we can detect
any visual information about the photos

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.834
contained in the brainwaves,

00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:22.189
so when we're done,
we're going to see if the EEG

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:24.811
can tell us what kind of picture
Christy is looking at,

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:28.419
and if it does, each category
should trigger a different brain signal.

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.071
OK, so we collected all the raw EEG data,
