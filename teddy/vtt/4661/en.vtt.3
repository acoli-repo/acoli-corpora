00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.071
OK, so we collected all the raw EEG data,

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:32.245
and this is what we got.

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.327
It all looks pretty messy,
so let's arrange them by picture.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.482
Now, still a bit too noisy
to see any differences,

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:42.546
but if we average the EEG
across all image types

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.006
by aligning them
to when the image first appeared,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.647
we can remove this noise,

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.005
and pretty soon, we can see
some dominant patterns

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.593
emerge for each category.

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:52.773
Now the signals all
still look pretty similar.

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:54.012
Let's take a closer look.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.561
About a hundred milliseconds
after the image comes on,

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:59.213
we see a positive bump in all four cases,

00:01:59.237 --> 00:02:02.026
and we call this the P100,
and what we think that is
