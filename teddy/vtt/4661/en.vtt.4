00:01:59.237 --> 00:02:02.026
and we call this the P100,
and what we think that is

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.125
is what happens in your brain
when you recognize an object.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.235
But damn, look at
that signal for the face.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.970
It looks different than the others.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.884
There's a negative dip
about 170 milliseconds

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:13.448
after the image comes on.

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:15.222
What could be going on here?

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:18.486
Research shows that our brain
has a lot of neurons that are dedicated

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.969
to recognizing human faces,

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:22.837
so this N170 spike could be
all those neurons

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.846
firing at once in the same location,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.504
and we can detect that in the EEG.

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.903
So there are two takeaways here.

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:32.012
One, our eyes can't really detect
the differences in patterns
