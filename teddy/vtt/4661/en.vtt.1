00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.950
and that brain is made
out of billions of neurons.

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:33.981
Each of those neurons sends
an electrical message to each other.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.819
These small messages can combine
to make an electrical wave

00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:38.413
that we can detect on a monitor.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.161
Now traditionally, the EEG
can tell us large-scale things,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:43.535
for example if you're asleep
or if you're alert.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.153
But can it tell us anything else?

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:46.879
Can it actually read our thoughts?

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.122
We're going to test this,

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:50.769
and we're not going to start
with some complex thoughts.

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:52.770
We're going to do something very simple.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:56.047
Can we interpret what someone is seeing
using only their brainwaves?

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.071
Nathan's going to begin by placing
electrodes on Christy's head.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.618
Nathan: My life is tangled.
