We're trying to code the information
that's coming out of her EEG

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.404
in real time

00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:04.889
and predict what it is
that her eyes are looking at.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.640
And if it works, what we should see

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:09.045
is every time that she gets
a picture of scenery,

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.355
it should say scenery,
scenery, scenery, scenery.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.336
A face -- face, face, face, face,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.891
but it's not quite working that way,
is what we're discovering.

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.933
(Laughter)

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:26.108
OK.

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:29.514
Director: So what's going on here?
GG: We need a new career, I think.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:30.608
(Laughter)
