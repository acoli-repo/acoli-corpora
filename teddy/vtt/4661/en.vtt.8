00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.636
By using a sensor, we can tell
the computer when the image first appears.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.262
That way, the brainwave stops being
a continuous stream of information,

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.997
and instead becomes
individual packets of meaning.

00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:09.389
Also, we're going
to cheat a little bit more,

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:11.225
by limiting the categories to two.

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.632
Let's see if we can do
some real-time mind-reading.

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:14.891
In this new experiment,

00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:17.012
we're going to constrict it
a little bit more

00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:19.288
so that we know the onset of the image

00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:22.694
and we're going to limit
the categories to "face" or "scenery."

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:24.608
Nathan: Face. Correct.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.131
Scenery. Correct.

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:30.624
GG: So right now,
every time the image comes on,
