00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:30.624
GG: So right now,
every time the image comes on,

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:32.914
we're taking a picture
of the onset of the image

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.633
and decoding the EEG.

00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:35.913
It's getting correct.

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:37.516
Nathan: Yes. Face. Correct.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.399
GG: So there is information
in the EEG signal, which is cool.

00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:42.960
We just had to align it
to the onset of the image.

00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:44.618
Nathan: Scenery. Correct.

00:04:47.344 --> 00:04:48.494
Face. Yeah.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:50.806
GG: This means there is some
information there,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.743
so if we know at what time
the picture came on,

00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:55.766
we can tell what type of picture it was,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.886
possibly, at least on average,
by looking at these evoked potentials.
