Greg Gage: Mind-reading.
You've seen this in sci-fi movies:

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:04.943
machines that can read our thoughts.

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:06.765
However, there are devices today

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.313
that can read the electrical
activity from our brains.

00:00:09.337 --> 00:00:10.609
We call this the EEG.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.524
Is there information
contained in these brainwaves?

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.361
And if so, could we train a computer
to read our thoughts?

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.289
My buddy Nathan
has been working to hack the EEG

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:21.989
to build a mind-reading machine.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.500
So this is how the EEG works.

00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:28.368
Inside your head is a brain,

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.950
and that brain is made
out of billions of neurons.
