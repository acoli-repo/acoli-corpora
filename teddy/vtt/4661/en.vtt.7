00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:30.608
(Laughter)

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:33.076
OK, so that was a massive failure.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.312
But we're still curious:
How far could we push this technology?

00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:37.976
And we looked back at what we did.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.143
We noticed that the data was coming
into our computer very quickly,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.408
without any timing
of when the images came on,

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.308
and that's the equivalent
of reading a very long sentence

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:47.937
without spaces between the words.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.399
It would be hard to read,

00:03:49.423 --> 00:03:53.136
but once we add the spaces,
individual words appear

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.204
and it becomes a lot more understandable.

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:57.075
But what if we cheat a little bit?

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.636
By using a sensor, we can tell
the computer when the image first appears.
