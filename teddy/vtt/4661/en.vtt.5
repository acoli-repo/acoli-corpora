00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:32.012
One, our eyes can't really detect
the differences in patterns

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:33.607
without averaging out the noise,

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.868
and two, even after removing the noise,

00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:38.893
our eyes can only pick up
the signals associated with faces.

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.185
So this is where we turn
to machine learning.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.185
Now, our eyes are not very good
at picking up patterns in noisy data,

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.155
but machine learning algorithms
are designed to do just that,

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.380
so could we take a lot of pictures
and a lot of data

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.194
and feed it in and train a computer

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:56.599
to be able to interpret
what Christy is looking at in real time?

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:01.205
We're trying to code the information
that's coming out of her EEG
