00:15:28.353 --> 00:15:32.153
from every age group: from the very young
to women in their '90s,

00:15:32.177 --> 00:15:33.559
to hundreds of wonderful men.

00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.595
People wrote and said,
"Please, can I help?

00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:37.835
Please, can I visit you
at party headquarters?"

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:40.527
We didn't have a headquarters --
we didn't have a party!

00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:41.749
We didn't have anything.

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:45.672
All we had was a wonderful,
tight group of fabulous friends

00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:50.381
trying to answer emails
pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.

00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:52.242
We were all busy.

00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:54.552
Many of us had careers,
many of us had children,

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.311
but we did what women do,
and we shared the work.

00:15:57.335 --> 00:16:00.773
And almost instantly, we agreed
on certain fundamental things.
