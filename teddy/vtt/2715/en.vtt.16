00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:03.781
I host a fantastic concert to celebrate
International Women's Day.

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:06.979
We gather the world's only
all-female orchestra,

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:10.792
we play fantastic music by forgotten
or overlooked women composers,

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:12.228
we have amazing conductors --

00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:14.546
it's Marin Alsop there
from Baltimore conducting,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.732
Petula Clark singing --

00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:18.436
and I give a lecture on women's history.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.845
I love to gather inspirational stories
from the past and pass them on.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:26.693
Too often, I think history's what I call
the Mount Rushmore model.

00:08:26.717 --> 00:08:31.104
It looks majestic, but the women
have been entirely left out of it.
