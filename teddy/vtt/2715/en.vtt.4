00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.029
I couldn't run then. I'm certainly
not going to do it now.

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:04.076
(Laughter)

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.657
So then I had my new idea:

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:08.759
Why not engage people like me in sport?

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.551
I think what the world needs now

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:14.497
is the Olympics for people
with zero athletic ability.

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.433
(Laughter)

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.404
Oh, it would be so much more fun.

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:20.038
We'd have three basic rules, OK?

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:23.139
Obviously no drugs;
no corruption, no skills.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.203
(Laughter)

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.380
It would be --

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:27.862
No, it's a terrible idea.

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:32.038
And I also know why I don't engage
with sport when I watch it on television.
