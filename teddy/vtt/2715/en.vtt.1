00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.964
until you realize that 95 percent of them

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.615
are the same ones you had the day before.

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.842
(Laughter)

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.255
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.484
I think things like,

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.593
"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:45.349
Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:46.655
My most popular:

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.585
"Don't eat that cookie."

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.167
(Laughter)

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.928
So, 95 percent repetition.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:58.884
That leaves us with just a five percent
window of opportunity each day

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.857
to actually think something new.
