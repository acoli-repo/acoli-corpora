00:11:58.306 --> 00:12:01.783
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
true in the British Parliament.

00:12:01.807 --> 00:12:06.198
In 2015, the number of men
elected to the Parliament that year

00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:09.103
was greater than the total number of women

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:12.207
who have ever been members of Parliament.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.390
And why does it matter?

00:12:13.414 --> 00:12:15.677
Here's the thing:
if they're not at the table --

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:18.797
literally, in Britain, at that table
helping to make the laws --

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.344
do not be surprised if the female
perspective is overlooked.

00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:26.748
It's a great role model for young people
to see a woman in charge.

00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:29.861
In 2016, Britain got its second
female Prime Minister;

00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:31.524
Theresa May came to power.
