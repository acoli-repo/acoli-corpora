It may be television's not so important,

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:33.810
but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.837
2016, the UN were looking
for a brand new ambassador

00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:40.652
to represent women's empowerment
and gender equality,

00:11:40.676 --> 00:11:42.152
and who did they choose?

00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:44.287
Wonder Woman.

00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.622
Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?

00:11:47.646 --> 00:11:48.847
(Laughter)

00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:52.719
Because no woman was up to the job.

00:11:53.718 --> 00:11:58.282
The representation of women
in positions of power is shockingly low.

00:11:58.306 --> 00:12:01.783
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
true in the British Parliament.
