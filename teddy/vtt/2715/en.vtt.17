It looks majestic, but the women
have been entirely left out of it.

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:35.094
And I was giving a talk in 2015
about the suffragettes --

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:38.773
I'm sure you know those magnificent
women who fought so hard

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:41.907
for the right for women
in Britain to vote.

00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.266
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.540
And boy, they succeeded,

00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:49.444
because women did indeed
get the vote in 1928.

00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:51.222
So I'm giving this talk about this,

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:53.842
and as I'm talking, what I realized is:

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.178
this was not a history
lecture I was giving;

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.694
this was not something
where the job was done.

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:02.346
This was something where
there was so much left to do.
