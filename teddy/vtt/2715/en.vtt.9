It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.

Maybe you face some kind of inequality,

00:04:33.977 --> 00:04:36.253
or you've come across
an injustice of some kind,

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:37.818
sometimes an illness strikes,

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:40.236
or you're born in some way disadvantaged,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.077
or perhaps underprivileged.

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:44.006
So I was born gay, OK?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.290
I've always known,

00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:48.352
I don't think my family
were the least bit surprised.

00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:51.594
Here is a picture of me aged four.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.401
I look cute,

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.576
but inside I genuinely believed
that I looked like Clint Eastwood.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.929
