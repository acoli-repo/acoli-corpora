Theresa May came to power.

00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:33.752
The day she came to power
she was challenged:

00:12:33.776 --> 00:12:34.970
just do one thing.

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:37.982
Do one thing in the first
100 days that you're in office

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:40.947
to try and improve
lives for women in Britain.

00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:42.968
And what did she do? Nothing.

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:44.293
Nothing.

00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:47.882
Because she's much too busy
cleaning up the mess the boys made.

00:12:48.492 --> 00:12:50.365
Even having a female leader,

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:53.383
they always find something better to do

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:56.694
than to sort out the pesky
issue of inequality.

00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:59.560
So I keep talking about equality
like it matters. Does it?

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:02.881
Well, let's take a very quick look
at the STEM industries, OK?
