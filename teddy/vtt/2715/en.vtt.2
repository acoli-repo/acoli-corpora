00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.857
to actually think something new.

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.673
And some of my new thoughts are useless.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.326
The other day I was watching
some sports on television,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.076
and I was trying to decide
why I just don't engage with it.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.363
Some of it I find curious.

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.642
This is odd.

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:15.816
(Laughter)

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:18.765
Do you think it would be
worth being that flexible

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.041
just to be able to see
your heel at that angle?

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.935
(Laughter)

00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:26.969
And here's the thing:

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:29.139
I'm never going to be able
to relate to that,

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.443
because I'm never going
to be able to do it, OK?
