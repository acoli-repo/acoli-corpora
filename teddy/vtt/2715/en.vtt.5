00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:32.038
And I also know why I don't engage
with sport when I watch it on television.

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:36.649
It's because probably 97 percent of it
is about men running

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.199
and men kicking things,

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:41.117
men trying to look
neatly packaged in Lycra.

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.300
There is --

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:43.822
(Laughter)

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:45.584
Not always successfully.

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:46.760
There is --

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:47.816
(Laughter)

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.073
There is so little
female sport on television,

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.978
that a young woman watching
might be forgiven for thinking,

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.559
and how can I put this nicely,

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:59.180
that the male member
is the very lever you need

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.809
to get yourself off the couch
and onto a sports ground.
