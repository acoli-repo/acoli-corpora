00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:30.056
And we wanted to change
how politics is conducted.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.563
I don't know if you have this,

00:16:31.587 --> 00:16:34.024
but in Britain we have
two major political parties.

00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:35.696
They're the dinosaurs of politics.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.258
And how they speak to each other
is shameful and poisonous.

00:16:39.735 --> 00:16:42.353
I'm sure you've never had
that kind of name-calling --

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.722
(Laughter)

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.163
And lying here.

00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:49.436
Wouldn't it be great
if just one politician said,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.355
"Do you know, my opponent has a point.

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:54.778
Let's see if we can't work together
and get the job done."

00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:59.319
(Applause)
