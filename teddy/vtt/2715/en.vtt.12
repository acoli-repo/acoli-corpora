And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.860
and we got death threats --

00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:05.794
enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,

00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:08.428
and we had to have police protection.

00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:13.120
And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night

00:06:13.144 --> 00:06:16.398
when I was terrified by what I had done.

00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:18.457
Eventually the dust settled.

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.808
Against all expectation
I carried on working,

00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:24.500
and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.

00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:27.437
I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.

00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.054
They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.
