00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.826
And in 2014, on the day
that the law was changed,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.996
I married my wife,
who I love very much, indeed.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.742
(Applause)

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:12.924
We didn't do it in a quiet way --
we did it on the stage

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:14.805
at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

00:07:15.212 --> 00:07:16.367
It was a great event.

00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:18.543
The hall seats two-and-a-half
thousand people.

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.140
We invited 150 family and friends,
then I let it be known to the public:

00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:25.377
anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,
please come and join us.

00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.626
It would be free to anybody
who wanted to come.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.772
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:33.017
(Applause)
