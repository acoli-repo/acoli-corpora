00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.595
I've got three kids,
I've got an elderly mom.

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.186
In fact, if I'm honest with you,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.853
one of the reasons I came out here

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.727
is because TED Talks said
I could have 15 minutes to myself,

00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.492
and I never have that much time --

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.885
(Laughter)

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.436
(Applause)

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.616
So I'm busy.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.177
And anyway, I already had a go
at changing the world.

00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:22.359
Here's the thing, OK?

00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:25.539
Everybody has inside themselves
what I call an "activation button."

00:04:25.563 --> 00:04:27.949
It's the button that gets
pressed when you think,

00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:29.777
"I must do something about this."

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.023
It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.
