00:14:27.878 --> 00:14:31.307
I didn't want what we were doing
to be a secret, you know? I just --

00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:32.624
(Laughter)

00:14:32.648 --> 00:14:35.874
Some people said, "You can't call it that!
It's much too feminist!"

00:14:35.898 --> 00:14:37.726
Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:41.256
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard somebody say,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.454
"I'm not a feminist, but ..."

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:46.440
And I always think
if there's a "but" in the sentence,

00:14:46.464 --> 00:14:48.233
it can't all be roses in the garden.

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:51.261
And then I started getting asked
the hilarious question,

00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:53.199
"Are you all going to burn your bras?"

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:57.581
Yes! Because bras are famously
made of flammable material.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.359
(Laughter)
