Here is another version that allows me
to separate bulk samples,

00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.511
and then, finally,

00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:37.535
something new that we've been working on

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:42.354
to be able to implement the entire
multiplex test on an object like this.

00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:46.715
So where you do the sample preparation
and the chemistry in the same object.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.826
Now ...

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.120

00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:00.172
this is what clinical trials
for malaria look like --
