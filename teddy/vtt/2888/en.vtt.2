00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:01.757
at no cost to the kids we sent them to.

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:03.481
This year alone,

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.637
with the support of our community,

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.141
we are planning to ship
a million microscopes

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.527
to kids around the world.

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.604
What does that do?

00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:15.384
It creates an inspiring community
of people around the world,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.080
learning and teaching each other,

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:21.194
from Kenya to Kampala
to Kathmandu to Kansas.

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:23.863
And one of the phenomenal things
that I love about this

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:25.443
is the sense of community.

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.263
There's a kid in Nicaragua

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.481
teaching others how to identify
mosquito species that carry dengue
