00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.344
Here is a little lancet.

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:02.238
These lancets are available everywhere,

00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:03.785
completely passive.

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:07.395
And if I've had breakfast today ...

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:11.534
That didn't hurt at all.

00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:15.542
OK, I take a little capillary
with a drop of blood --

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:17.825
now this drop of blood has answers,

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.528
that's why I'm interested in it.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.377
It might actually tell me whether
I have malaria right now or not.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.233
I take a little capillary,

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.382
and you see it starts wicking in.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.156
I'm going to draw a little more blood.
