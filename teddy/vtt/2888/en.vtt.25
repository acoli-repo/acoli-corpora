00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:32.351
we mapped one of the largest
acoustic databases

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:37.603
with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes
that carry human pathogens.

00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:39.306
And from this and machine learning,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.114
anybody who uploads this data,

00:12:41.138 --> 00:12:43.126
we can identify and tell the probability

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.984
of what species of mosquitoes
you're actually working with.

00:12:46.008 --> 00:12:48.823
We call this Abuzz,
and if any of you want to sign up,

00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.065
just go to the website.

00:12:50.523 --> 00:12:52.165
Let me close with something

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:54.490
that's very important
and dear to my heart.

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:59.451
One of the challenges of today
is we have terrible problems.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.373
We have a billion people
with absolutely no health care,
