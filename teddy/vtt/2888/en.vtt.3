00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.481
teaching others how to identify
mosquito species that carry dengue

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.923
by looking at the larva
under a microscope.

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:36.495
There's a pharmacologist
who came up with a new way

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.762
to detect fake drugs anywhere.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.461
There is a girl who wondered:

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.183
"How does glitter actually work?"

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:46.926
and discovered the physics
of crystalline formation in glitter.

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.318
There is an Argentinian doctor

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:53.604
who's trying to do field cervical cancer
screening with this tool.

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:57.366
And yours very truly found
a species of flea

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.166
that was dug inside my heel in my foot
one centimeter deep.
