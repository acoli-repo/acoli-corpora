00:07:57.092 --> 00:08:00.480
A little piece of tape
to make a sealed cavity.

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:03.870
So now the sample is completely enclosed.

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:09.400
And we are ready for a spin.

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.060
I'm pushing and pulling with this object.

00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:14.783
I'm going to load this up ...

00:08:16.277 --> 00:08:18.560
And you see the object starts spinning.

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:20.598
Unlike a regular centrifuge,

00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:24.401
this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:26.761
It goes back and forth, back and forth ...

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:29.349
And now I'm charging it up,

00:08:29.373 --> 00:08:31.201
and you see it builds momentum.
