00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.652
5,000 years ago.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:04.375
We have found relics of this object
hidden around on our planet.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.045
Now the irony is,

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.804
we actually don't understand
how this little thing works.

00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:12.231
That's when I get excited.

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:14.878
So we got back to work,

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:16.692
wrote down a couple of equations.

00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:20.369
If you take the input torque
that you put in,

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:22.497
you take the drag on this disc,

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.426
and the twist drag on these strings,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.939
you should be able
to mathematically solve this.

00:05:26.963 --> 00:05:29.771
This is not the only equation in my talk.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.627
Ten pages of math later,
