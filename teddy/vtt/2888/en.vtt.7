"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:33.937
so this piece of junk
is good as a doorstop."

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:37.326
Centrifuges, for some of you
who don't know,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.574
are the pinnacle tool to be able
to do sample processing.

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:43.340
You separate components
of blood or body fluids

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:45.824
to be able to detect
and identify pathogens.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.253
But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:51.471
cost around 1,000 dollars --

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.501
and really hard to carry out in the field.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.682
And of course,

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.140
they don't work without power.

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:57.556
Sound familiar?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.128
So we started thinking
about solving this problem,
