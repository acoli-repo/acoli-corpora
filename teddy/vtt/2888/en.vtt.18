00:08:59.154 --> 00:09:03.077
And the ratio of that actually tells me
whether I might be anemic.

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:07.138
One of the aspects of this is,
we build many types of Paperfuges.

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:11.628
This one allows us to identify
malaria parasites

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.469
by running them for a little longer,

00:09:13.493 --> 00:09:17.059
and we can identify malaria parasites
that are in the blood

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:20.657
that we can separate out and detect
with something like a centrifuge.

00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:25.161
Another version of this allows me
to separate nucleic acids

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:28.742
to be able to do nucleic acid tests
out in the field itself.

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:33.917
Here is another version that allows me
to separate bulk samples,
