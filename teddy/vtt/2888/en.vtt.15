I'm going to draw a little more blood.

00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:35.025
And that's good enough for right now.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:39.649
Now, I just seal this capillary
by putting it in clay.

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:45.772
And now that's sealed the sample.

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:47.925
We're going to take the sample,

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.913
mount it on Paperfuge.

00:07:57.092 --> 00:08:00.480
A little piece of tape
to make a sealed cavity.
