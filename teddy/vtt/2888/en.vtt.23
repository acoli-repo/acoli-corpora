00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:30.016
We realized that using a regular phone,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.581
a $5-10 flip phone --

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:34.707
how many remember what this object is?

00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:35.791
(Laughter)

00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:39.976
We can record these acoustic
signatures from mosquitoes.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.936
I'll tell you exactly how to do this.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.651
I caught some mosquitoes outside.

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:46.063
Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm not
going to release them.

00:11:46.087 --> 00:11:47.127
(Laughter)

00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:49.726
But I will tell you how
to record from this.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.192
All you do is tap them and they fly.

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:53.557
You can first test --

00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:55.333
I can actually hear that.

00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:57.811
And you bring your phone,
which has microphones --

00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:00.201
it turns out the mics
are so damn good already,
