00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.421
we tried these spinning tops,

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.327
and then in the lab,

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.433
we stumbled upon this wonder.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.256
It's the whirligig,
or a buzzer, or a rundle.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.697
A couple of strings and a little disk,

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.928
and if I push, it spins.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.694
How many of you have played
with this as a kid?

00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:48.566
This is called a button-on-a-string.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.226
OK, maybe 50 percent of you.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.808
What you didn't realize --

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.145
that this little object

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.532
is the oldest toy
in the history of mankind ...

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.652
5,000 years ago.
