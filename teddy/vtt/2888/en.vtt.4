that was dug inside my heel in my foot
one centimeter deep.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:07.578
Now, you might think
of these as anomalies.

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:09.995
But there is a method to this madness.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.847
I call this "frugal science" --

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:16.723
the idea of sharing
the experience of science,

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:18.462
and not just the information.

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.226
To remind you:

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.334
there are a billion people on this planet

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:24.873
who live with absolutely
no infrastructure:

00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:26.511
no roads,

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:27.917
no electricity

00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:29.727
and thus, no health care.
