00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:30.208
that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.392
OK, in the negative time I have left,

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.482
I'll tell you about the most recent --

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:37.626
(Laughter)

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.520
invention from our lab.

00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:40.897
It's called Abuzz --

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:45.752
the idea that all of you
could help us fight mosquitoes;

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:48.043
you could all help us track our enemies.

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:52.055
These are enemies because they cause
malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.863
But the challenge is that we actually
don't know where our enemies are.

00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:59.866
The world map for where
mosquitoes are is missing.
