00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.373
We have a billion people
with absolutely no health care,

00:13:02.397 --> 00:13:04.522
climate change, biodiversity loss,

00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:05.731
on and on and on.

00:13:06.226 --> 00:13:09.176
And we hope that science
is going to provide the answer.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.738
But before you leave this theatre today,

00:13:11.762 --> 00:13:13.516
I want you to promise one thing.

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:16.303
We're going to make science accessible --

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:19.205
not just to the people who can afford it,

00:13:19.229 --> 00:13:21.111
but a billion others who can't.

00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:25.777
Let's make science and scientific
literacy a human right.

00:13:27.564 --> 00:13:32.239
The moment that you pass the tingling
feeling of making a discovery
