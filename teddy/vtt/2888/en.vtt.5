Also, there a billion kids
on this planet that live in poverty.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.368
How are we supposed to inspire them

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:39.714
for the next generation
of solution makers?

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.012
There are health care workers
that we put on the line

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.954
to fight infectious diseases,

00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:49.435
to protect us with absolutely
bare-minimum tools and resources.

00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:52.178
So as a lab at Stanford,

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:56.139
I think of this from a context
of frugal science

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.748
and building solutions
for these communities.

00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:03.354
Often we think about being able to do
diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.
