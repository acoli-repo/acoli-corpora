00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:00.269
it starts to spin.

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.378
Now, when you realize,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.345
when you do the math,

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:08.069
when we calculate the rpm for this object,

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:12.825
mathematically, we should be able
to go all the way to a million rpm.

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.042
Now, there is a little twist
in human anatomy,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:18.141
because the resonant frequency
of this object is about 10 hertz,

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:19.969
and if you've ever played the piano,

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.087
you can't go higher
than two or three hertz.

00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:25.375
The maximum speed we've been able
to achieve with this object

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.328
is not 10,000 rpm,

00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:28.956
not 50,000 rpm --

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.905
120,000 rpm.
