00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:00.172
this is what clinical trials
for malaria look like --

00:10:00.196 --> 00:10:01.199
(Laughter)

00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:03.580
You can do this while having coffee.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.477
But most importantly,

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:09.563
this is a village six hours from any road.

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:14.599
We are in a room with one of the senior
members of the community

00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:16.136
and a health care worker.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.657
It really is this portion of the work
that excites me the most --

00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:20.839
that smile,

00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:24.737
to be able to share simple but powerful
tools with people around the world.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.781
Now, I forgot to tell you this,

00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:30.208
that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.
