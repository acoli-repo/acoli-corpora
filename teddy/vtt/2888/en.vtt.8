00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.128
So we started thinking
about solving this problem,

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:01.702
and I came back --

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.392
kept thinking about toys.

00:04:03.818 --> 00:04:04.982
Now ...

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.788
I have a few with me here.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:09.919
I first started with yo-yos ...

00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:12.574
and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.

00:04:12.923 --> 00:04:14.604
Because these objects spin,

00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:15.790
we wondered,

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:18.171
could we actually use
the physics of these objects

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.904
to be able to build centrifuges?

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:23.747
This was possibly the worst
throw I could make.

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:25.929
But you might start realizing,

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.792
if you start exploring
the space of toys --

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.421
we tried these spinning tops,
