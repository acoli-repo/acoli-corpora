00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.627
Ten pages of math later,

00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.510
we could actually write down
the complete analytical solution

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:35.808
for this dynamic system.

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:39.999
And out comes what we call "Paperfuge."

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:42.567
That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.258
who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:46.527
And to the left, you see
all the centrifuges

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.978
that we're trying to replace.

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:51.709
This little object that you see right here

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.184
is a disc, a couple
of strings and a handle.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.382
And when I spin

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.093
and I push,

00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:00.269
it starts to spin.
