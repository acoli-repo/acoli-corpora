00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.905
120,000 rpm.

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:33.733
That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.964
If I was to stick you right here
and have it spin,

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:40.417
you would think about the types
of forces you would experience.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.679
One of the factors of a tool like this

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:45.697
is to be able to do diagnosis with this.

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.001
So, I'm going to do
a quick demo here, where --

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:54.037
this is a moment where I'm going
to make a little finger prick,

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.336
and a tiny drop of blood
is going to come out.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.981
If you don't like blood,
you don't have to look at it.

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.344
Here is a little lancet.
