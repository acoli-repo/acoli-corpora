00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:02.494
Over the decades,

00:00:02.518 --> 00:00:05.839
my colleagues and I have exposed
terrible misdeeds and crimes

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:07.496
by large corporations,

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:10.223
which have taken many lives

00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:12.303
and caused injuries and diseases,

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.568
on top of damaging economic costs,

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:18.696
affecting many incidents.

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:21.733
But exposure was not enough.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.177
We had to secure congressional mandates

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:28.195
to prevent such devastation.

00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:32.795
As a result, many lives were saved
and many traumas prevented,
