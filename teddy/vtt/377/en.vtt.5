00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the way of life they needed to nurture.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He explained to them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it was a question of understanding

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
what they needed to survive

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and to protect that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000

Benki left the forest for the first time.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to the Earth Summit

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to tell the world what was happening

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in his tiny, little corner.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.
