00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I finally met him earlier this year

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
at his museum in Chengdu.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
He's been a collector all of his life,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Over a lifetime, through everything,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
he's kept collecting,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
so that he now has over eight million pieces

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in his museums

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,
