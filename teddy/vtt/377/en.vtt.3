00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because he was taken under his grandfather's wing

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when he was only two years old

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to begin to learn about the forest

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and the way of life of his people.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
His grandfather died when he was only 10.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And at that young age, 10 years old,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
person in the community.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is the person who contains within him

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
all the knowledge, all the wisdom
