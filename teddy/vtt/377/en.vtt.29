00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
in 10 Easy Steps."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
They have drive, passion, commitment.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
They've gone away

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
from what they did before,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and they've gone

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to something they didn't know.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They've tried to connect worlds

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
they didn't know existed before.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
They have a sense of the great arc of time

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and their tiny place in it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
They know people have come before them

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and will follow them.
