00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
a period that actually most Chinese

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
would prefer to forget.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
But he doesn't want his nation

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
ever to forget.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
These people inspire me,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and they inspire me because they show us

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
what is possible when you change the way

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
you look at the world,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
change the way you look at your place in the world.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
They looked outside,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and then they changed what was on the inside.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They didn't go to business school.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
in 10 Easy Steps."
