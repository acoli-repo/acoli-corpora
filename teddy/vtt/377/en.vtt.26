00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
slightly larger than life bronze statues

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
including those Chinese

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
who then fought with each other

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to commemorating all the unknown,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
ordinary soldiers who survived,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000

he is making sure -- one man is making sure --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that history is not forgotten.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
