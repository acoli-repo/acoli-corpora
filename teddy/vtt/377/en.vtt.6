00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Some did, not everybody.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But if you can imagine this young man

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
with his headdress and his flowing robe,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
learning a new language, Portuguese,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
not to mention English,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
going to Rio,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
building a bridge

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to reach out to people he'd never met before --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a pretty hostile world.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But he wasn't dismayed.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Benki came back to his village full of ideas --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
new technologies, new research,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
new ways of understanding what was going on.
