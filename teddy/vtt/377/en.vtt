00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to talk

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about some of my discoveries

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
around the world through my work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These are not discoveries of planets

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or new technologies

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or science.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're discoveries of people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the way people are, and new leadership.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is Benki.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
His people live in Brazil

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and in Peru.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Benki comes from a village

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so remote up in the Amazon
