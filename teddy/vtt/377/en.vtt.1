00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so remote up in the Amazon

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that to get there, either you have to fly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and land on water,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or go by canoe for several days.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when I'd brought him and other leaders

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from indigenous peoples

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to meet with me and leaders from around the world,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because we wanted to learn from each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We wanted to share our stories with each other.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The Ashaninka people

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
are known throughout South America

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for their dignity, their spirit
