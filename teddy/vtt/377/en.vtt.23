He was born in 1957,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and you can imagine what his childhood

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
looked like and felt like,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and what his life has been like

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
over the last 50 tumultuous years.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He's been a soldier, a teacher,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
a politician, a vice-mayor

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and a business man.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and what do you do?"

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
He would tell you, "I'm a collector,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and I curate a museum."

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I finally met him earlier this year

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
at his museum in Chengdu.
