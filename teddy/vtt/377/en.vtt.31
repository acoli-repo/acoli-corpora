00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
on a global basis.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I think it has to start with us.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And we know, just like they knew,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
how hard it is.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
we have models, we have examples,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We can look at what they've done, if we look.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We can learn from what they've learned.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.
