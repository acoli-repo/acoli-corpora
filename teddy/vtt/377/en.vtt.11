00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We are running out of what we need.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And we also know

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that the world has changed in other ways,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that since 1960

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there are one-third as many new countries

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that exist as independent entities on the planet.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Egos, systems of government --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
figuring it out --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
massive change.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And in addition to that,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we know that five other really big countries

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
are going to have a say in the future,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --
