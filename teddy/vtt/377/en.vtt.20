00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and he's HIV-positive.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But he saw the work, the care,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the compassion

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and he wanted to be part of it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
as is so often the case,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
they bring theater troupes,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
songs, music, dance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And they sit around,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and they talk about dreams.
