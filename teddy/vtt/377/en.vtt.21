00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And they sit around,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and they talk about dreams.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Sanghamitra told me just last week --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and she had a real breakthrough.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And the young women in the village

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Our dream

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is for our partners, our husbands,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
not to be given to us because of a horoscope,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but to be given to us

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
because they've been tested for HIV."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
