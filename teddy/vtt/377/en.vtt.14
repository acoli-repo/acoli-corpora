00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We need new models

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of being a leader and a human in the world.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I started life as a banker.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now I don't admit to that

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to anybody but my very close friends.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But for the past eight years,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I've done something completely different.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
My work has taken me around the world,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
where I've had the real privilege

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of meeting people like Benki

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and many others who are making change happen

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in their communities --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
people who see the world differently,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
who are asking different questions,
