00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm not at all a cook.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But I do want to talk to you about something

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that I think is dear to all of us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And that is bread -- something which is as simple

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
as our basic, most fundamental human staple.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I think few of us spend the day

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
without eating bread in some form.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
bread is standard.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
