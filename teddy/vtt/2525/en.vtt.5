Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.896
Brexit teaches us many things
about our society

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.280
and about societies around the world.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.616
It highlights in ways
that we seem embarrassingly unaware of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.360
how divided our societies are.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.176
The vote split along lines of age,
education, class and geography.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.096
Young people didn't turn out
to vote in great numbers,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.336
but those that did wanted to remain.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.096
Older people really wanted
to leave the European Union.
