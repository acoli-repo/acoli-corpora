00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.296
is the gap between public perception
and empirical reality.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.016
It's been suggested that we've moved
to a postfactual society,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.696
where evidence and truth no longer matter,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.816
and lies have equal status
to the clarity of evidence.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.096
So how can we --

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.816

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.016
How can we rebuild respect for truth
and evidence into our liberal democracies?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.976
It has to begin with education,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.320
but it has to start with the recognition
that there are huge gaps.
