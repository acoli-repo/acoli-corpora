00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.136
that have the strongest Leave vote,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.560
I've spent a combined total
of four days of my life in those areas.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.056
In some of those places,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.656
I didn't even know the names
of the voting districts.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.536
It was a real shock to me,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.616
and it suggested that people like me

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.736
who think of ourselves
as inclusive, open and tolerant,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.456
perhaps don't know
our own countries and societies

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.096
nearly as well as we like to believe.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.000
