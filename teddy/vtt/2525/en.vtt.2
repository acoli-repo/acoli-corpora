00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.776
in my country.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.016
There were calls for a second referendum,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.576
almost as if, following a sports match,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.120
we could ask the opposition for a replay.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.336
Everybody was blaming everybody else.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.936
People blamed the Prime Minister

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.136
for calling the referendum
in the first place.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.616
They blamed the leader of the opposition
for not fighting it hard enough.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.896
The young accused the old.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.800
The educated blamed
the less well-educated.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.536
That complete meltdown was made even worse

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.656
by the most tragic element of it:

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.536
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
in the streets of Britain
