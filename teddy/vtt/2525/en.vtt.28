00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.256
and one of the ideas
I spent a lot of my time preaching,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.056
mainly to developing countries
around the world,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.656
is that in order to encourage
the integration of refugees,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.016
we can't just benefit
the refugee populations,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.080
we also have to address the concerns
of the host communities in local areas.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.816
But in looking at that,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.856
one of the policy prescriptions
is that we have to provide

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.496
disproportionately better
education facilities, health facilities,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.296
access to social services

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.576
in those regions of high immigration

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.416
to address the concerns
of those local populations.
