00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.736
huge public misinformation

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.496
and misunderstanding
about the nature of immigration.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.736
For example, in these attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.496
the public believed that levels of asylum

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.936
were a greater proportion
of immigration than they were,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.416
but they also believed
the levels of educational migration

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.536
were far lower as a proportion
of overall migration

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.056
than they actually are.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.736
So we have to address this misinformation,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.256
the gap between perception and reality
on key aspects of globalization.
