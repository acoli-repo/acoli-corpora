00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.416
to address the concerns
of those local populations.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.096
But while we encourage that
around the developing world,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.696
we don't take those lessons home

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.560
and incorporate them in our own societies.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.536
Furthermore, if we're going
to really take seriously

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.896
the need to ensure people share
in the economic benefits,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.576
our businesses and corporations
need a model of globalization

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.200
that recognizes that they, too,
have to take people with them.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.496
The fourth and final idea
I want to put forward

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.400
is an idea that we need
more responsible politics.
