00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.456
The fault line of contemporary politics is
between those that embrace globalization

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
and those that fear globalization.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.600
(Applause)

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.336
If we look at why
those who wanted to leave --

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.896
we call them "Leavers,"
as opposed to "Remainers" --

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.136
we see two factors in the opinion polls

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.536
that really mattered.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.896
The first was immigration,
and the second sovereignty,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.376
and these represent a desire for people
to take back control of their own lives
