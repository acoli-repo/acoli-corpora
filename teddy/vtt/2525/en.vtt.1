00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.616
when I woke up on the morning of June 24

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.496
to discover that my country
had voted to leave the European Union,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.376
my Prime Minister had resigned,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.976
and Scotland was considering a referendum

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.840
that could bring to an end
the very existence of the United Kingdom.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.856
So that was an immense shock for me,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.160
and it was an immense
shock for many people,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.536
but it was also something
that, over the following several days,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.296
created a complete political meltdown

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.776
in my country.
