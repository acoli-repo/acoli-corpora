00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.656
a vision of a more tolerant,
inclusive globalization,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.480
one that brings people with us
rather than leaving them behind.

That vision of globalization

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.416
is one that has to start by a recognition
of the positive benefits of globalization.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.016
The consensus amongst economists

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.816
is that free trade,
the movement of capital,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.776
the movement of people across borders

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.536
benefit everyone on aggregate.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.256
The consensus amongst
international relations scholars

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.896
is that globalization
brings interdependence,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.856
which brings cooperation and peace.
