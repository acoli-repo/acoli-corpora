00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.216
How can we balance on the one hand
addressing fear and alienation

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.656
while on the other hand
refusing vehemently

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.456
to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.616
That is the question for all of us.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.456
And I think, as a social scientist,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.280
that social science
offers some places to start.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.216
Our transformation has to be about
both ideas and about material change,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.856
and I want to give you four ideas
as a starting point.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.416
The first relates to the idea
of civic education.
