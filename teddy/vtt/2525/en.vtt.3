00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.536
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
in the streets of Britain

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.816
at a level that I have never seen before

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.080
in my lifetime.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.176
People are now talking about whether
my country is becoming a Little England,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.296
or, as one of my colleagues put it,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.496
whether we're about to become
a 1950s nostalgia theme park

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.536
floating in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.640
(Laughter)

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.376
But my question is really,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.680
should we have the degree of shock
that we've experienced since?
