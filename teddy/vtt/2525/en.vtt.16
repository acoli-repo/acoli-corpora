which brings cooperation and peace.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.336

also has redistributive effects.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.096
It creates winners and losers.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.256
To take the example of migration,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.936
we know that immigration is a net positive
for the economy as a whole

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.480
under almost all circumstances.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.136
But we also have to be very aware

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.216
that there are
redistributive consequences,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.696
that importantly, low-skilled immigration

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.135
can lead to a reduction in wages
for the most impoverished in our societies
