00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.320
but it has to start with the recognition
that there are huge gaps.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.616
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.936
published a survey
on attitudes to immigration,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.976
and it showed that as numbers
of immigrants increase,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.216
so public concern
with immigration also increases,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.656
although it obviously
didn't unpack causality,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.816
because this could equally be to do
not so much with numbers

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.240
but the political
and media narrative around it.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.576
But the same survey also revealed

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.736
huge public misinformation
