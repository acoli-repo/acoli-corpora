00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.976
And the challenge that comes from that
is we need to find a new way

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.096
to narrate globalization to those people,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.496
to recognize that for those people who
have not necessarily been to university,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.936
who haven't necessarily
grown up with the Internet,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.976
that don't get opportunities to travel,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.856
they may be unpersuaded
by the narrative that we find persuasive

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.080
in our often liberal bubbles.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.040
