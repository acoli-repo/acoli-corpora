00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.680
should we have the degree of shock
that we've experienced since?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.816
Was it something
that took place overnight?

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.336
Or are there deeper structural factors
that have led us to where we are today?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.936
So I want to take a step back
and ask two very basic questions.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.856
First, what does Brexit represent,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.416
not just for my country,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.176
but for all of us around the world?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.376
And second, what can we do about it?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.736
How should we all respond?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.280
So first, what does Brexit represent?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.200
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
