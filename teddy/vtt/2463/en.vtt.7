One by one, these birds
became his teachers.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:34.204
They taught him music -- scales, in fact.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.082
And Yared, eventually
recognized as Saint Yared,

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:42.544
used these scales to compose
five volumes of chants and hymns

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:44.740
for worship and celebration.

00:03:44.764 --> 00:03:48.153
And he used these scales
to compose and to create

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:50.927
an indigenous musical notation system.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:55.268
And these scales evolved
into what is known as kiñit,

00:03:55.292 --> 00:04:01.185
the unique, pentatonic, five-note,
modal system that is very much alive
