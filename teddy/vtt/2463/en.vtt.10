00:04:57.813 --> 00:05:01.805
where a shift in melodic inflection
gives the same phonetic syllable

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:03.586
an entirely different meaning,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.952
to a language like English,

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:07.346
where a raised pitch
at the end of a sentence ...

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.388
(Going up in pitch) implies a question?

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.021
(Laughter)

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:12.704
As an Ethiopian-American woman,

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.136
I grew up around the language
of Amharic, Amhariña.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.639
It was my first language,
the language of my parents,

00:05:17.663 --> 00:05:20.220
one of the main languages of Ethiopia.

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:23.910
And there are a million reasons
to fall in love with this language:

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.775
its depth of poetics,
its double entendres,

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:29.416
its wax and gold, its humor,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.330
its proverbs that illuminate
the wisdom and follies of life.
