00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:30.240
how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make?

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.600
I believe that everyday soundscape

00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.065
can be the most unexpected
inspiration for songwriting,

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.604
and to look at this idea
a little bit more closely,

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:40.749
I'm going to talk today
about three things:

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.797
nature, language and silence --

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.154
or rather, the impossibility
of true silence.

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.357
And through this I hope to give you
a sense of a world

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.432
already alive with musical expression,

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:57.437
with each of us serving
as active participants,

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.716
whether we know it or not.
