00:11:57.355 --> 00:12:01.090
But there is a kind of sonic lineage
to which we all belong.

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:04.890
So the next time you are seeking
percussion inspiration,

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:08.263
look no further than your tires,
as they roll over the unusual grooves

00:12:08.287 --> 00:12:10.011
of the freeway,

00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:12.213
or the top-right burner of your stove

00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:13.946
and that strange way that it clicks

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.032
as it is preparing to light.

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:18.345
When seeking melodic inspiration,

00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:21.861
look no further than dawn
and dusk avian orchestras

00:12:21.885 --> 00:12:25.113
or to the natural lilt
of emphatic language.

00:12:25.137 --> 00:12:28.136
We are the audience
and we are the composers

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.955
and we take from these pieces

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.130
we are given.
