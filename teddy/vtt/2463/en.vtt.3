That is the sound of a bird

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:37.606
slowed down to a pace

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.352
that the human ear mistakenly
recognizes as its own.

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:46.816
It was released as part of Peter Szöke's

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.222

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.644
Let's listen to the full-speed recording.
