The musician or musicians are invited
to walk onto the stage

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:07.685
with a stopwatch and open the score,

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:10.640
which was actually purchased

00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:12.046
the score, that is.

00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:16.149
And this score has not
a single note written

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:18.647
and there is not a single note played

00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:21.403
for four minutes and 33 seconds.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.230
And, at once enraging and enrapturing,

00:08:27.254 --> 00:08:30.142

when there are no strings
