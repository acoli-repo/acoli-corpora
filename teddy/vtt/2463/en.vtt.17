Cage shows us that even
when there are no strings

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:35.214
being plucked by fingers
or hands hammering piano keys,

00:08:35.238 --> 00:08:37.715
still there is music,
still there is music,

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:39.801
still there is music.

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:41.953
And what is this music?

00:08:42.903 --> 00:08:45.108
It was that sneeze in the back.

00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:46.678
(Laughter)

00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:51.762
It is the everyday soundscape
that arises from the audience themselves:

00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:56.056
their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,
their whispers, their sneezes,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.621
the room, the wood
of the floors and the walls

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:01.103
expanding and contracting,
creaking and groaning
