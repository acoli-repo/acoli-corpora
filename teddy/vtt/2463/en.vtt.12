It kind of depends on the situation.

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.280
But when I was a kid,
this was my very favorite word,

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:08.404
and I think it's because it has a pitch.

00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.932
It has a melody.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.957
You can almost see the shape
as it springs from someone's mouth.

00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.710
"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.

00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:19.480
And as a musician and composer,
when I hear that word,

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.573
something like this
is floating through my mind.
