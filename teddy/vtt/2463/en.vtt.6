His name was Yared.

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:05.610
When Yared was seven years old
his father died,

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:09.257
and his mother sent him to go live
with an uncle, who was a priest

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.576
of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.734
one of the oldest churches in the world.

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:18.353
Now, this tradition has an enormous amount
of scholarship and learning,

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:21.389
and Yared had to study and study
and study and study,

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:24.029
and one day he was studying under a tree,

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.580
when three birds came to him.

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:30.389
One by one, these birds
became his teachers.
