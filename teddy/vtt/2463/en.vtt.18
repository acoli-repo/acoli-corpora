expanding and contracting,
creaking and groaning

with the heat and the cold,

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.646
the pipes clanking and contributing.

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:10.946
And controversial though it was,
and even controversial though it remains,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.214
Cage's point is that there is no
such thing as true silence.

00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:20.612
Even in the most silent environments,
we still hear and feel the sound

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:22.163
of our own heartbeats.

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:25.814
The world is alive
with musical expression.

00:09:26.383 --> 00:09:28.590
We are already immersed.
