00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.079
(Clanking ends)

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.059
And it stopped me cold.

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:08.950
I thought, "What a weird, cool swing
that cooking pan lid has."

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.784
So when the lentils were ready and eaten,

00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:18.302
I hightailed it to my backyard studio,

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.169
and I made this.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:26.187
(Music, including the sound
of the lid, and singing)
