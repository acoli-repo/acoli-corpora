00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:01.572
(Music ends)

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.016
And in both of those cases,
what I did was I took the melody

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.499
and the phrasing
of those words and phrases

00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:12.089
and I turned them into musical parts
to use in these short compositions.

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.020
And I like to write bass lines,

00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:16.095
so they both ended up
kind of as bass lines.

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:20.013
Now, this is based on the work
of Jason Moran and others

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:23.075
who work intimately
with music and language,

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.043
but it's also something I've had
in my head since I was a kid,

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.098
how musical my parents sounded

00:07:28.122 --> 00:07:31.274
when they were speaking
to each other and to us.
