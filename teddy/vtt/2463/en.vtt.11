00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.330
its proverbs that illuminate
the wisdom and follies of life.

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:38.117
But there's also this melodicism,
a musicality built right in.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.609
And I find this distilled most clearly

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.106
in what I like to call
emphatic language --

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.366
language that's meant
to highlight or underline

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.445
or that springs from surprise.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.443
Take, for example, the word: "indey."

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:53.306
Now, if there are Ethiopians
in the audience,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.337
they're probably chuckling to themselves,

00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.445
because the word means
something like "No!"

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.280
or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."

00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.405
It kind of depends on the situation.
