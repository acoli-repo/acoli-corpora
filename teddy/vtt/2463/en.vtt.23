00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:31.508
And if that's true,

00:11:31.532 --> 00:11:34.477
it means that we're hard-wired for music,

00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:36.614
that we can find it anywhere,

00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:39.716
that there is no such thing
as a musical desert,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.439
that we are permanently
hanging out at the oasis,

00:11:43.463 --> 00:11:45.520
and that is marvelous.

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:49.328
We can add to the soundtrack,
but it's already playing.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.114
And it doesn't mean don't study music.

00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:56.634
Study music, trace your sonic lineages
and enjoy that exploration.

00:11:57.355 --> 00:12:01.090
But there is a kind of sonic lineage
to which we all belong.
