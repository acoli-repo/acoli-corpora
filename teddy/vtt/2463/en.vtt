As a singer-songwriter,

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:07.127
people often ask me about my influences
or, as I like to call them,

00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:09.539
my sonic lineages.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.191
And I could easily tell you

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:14.635
that I was shaped by the jazz
and hip hop that I grew up with,

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.970
by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.897
or by the 1980s pop
on my childhood radio stations.

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:25.374
But beyond genre,
there is another question:

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:30.240
how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make?
