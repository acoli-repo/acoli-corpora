00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.023
Now, I had my own moment of,
let's say, remixing John Cage

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:35.714
a couple of months ago

00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:38.741
when I was standing
in front of the stove cooking lentils.

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.907
And it was late one night
and it was time to stir,

00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:43.903
so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,

00:09:43.927 --> 00:09:46.360
and I placed it onto
the kitchen counter next to me,

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:48.647
and it started to roll back and forth

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.432
making this sound.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:57.765
(Sound of metal lid
clanking against a counter)

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.079
(Clanking ends)
