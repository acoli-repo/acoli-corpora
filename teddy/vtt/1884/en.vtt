00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:02.323
I suspect that

00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:04.080
every aid worker in Africa

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.673
comes to a time in her career

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.989
when she wants to take all 
the money for her project â€”

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.091
maybe it's a school or a training program â€”

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.980
pack it in a suitcase,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.964
get on a plane flying over the
poorest villages in the country,

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.148
and start throwing that money out the window.

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:23.464
Because to a veteran aid worker,

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:26.171
the idea of putting cold, hard cash

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:29.210
into the hands of the poorest people on Earth

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.865
doesn't sound crazy,
