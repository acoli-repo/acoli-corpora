00:00:01.873 --> 00:00:06.669
Breast cancer is one of the leading
causes of cancer deaths globally.

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:10.840
About one in eight US women
will develop invasive breast cancer

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.717
over the course of their lifetime.

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:17.597
And globally, millions of women
suffer from breast cancer every year.

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.434
But it is quite treatable
if detected early.

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:26.064
Right now, actually,
mammography is the gold standard

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:27.690
for breast cancer diagnosis.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.153
But mammography has a 10 percent chance
of missed detection.
