Have you ever seen a spiderweb
early in the morning?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.776
It's covered with dew,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.056
so this microalgae learned
that in order to carry photosynthesis

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.096
in the coast of the driest
desert on Earth,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.616
they could use the spiderwebs.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.056
So here they may access
the water from the fogs

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320
that regularly cover
these areas in the morning.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.480
In another cave, we found
a different type of microalgae.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.336
This one is able to use ocean mist
as a source of water,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.496
and strikingly lives
in the very bottom of a cave,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.736
so it has adapted to live
with less than 0.1 percent
