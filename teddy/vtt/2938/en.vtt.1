00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.856
how can you be an astrobiologist

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.680
if you don't have your own spaceship?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.856
Well, what I do is that I study life

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.856
in those environments on Earth

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.200
that most closely resemble
other interesting places in the universe.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.576
All life on Earth requires water,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.136

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.656
between water and life

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.256
in order to understand

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
if we could find life
in a planet as dry as Mars.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.976
But since I do not have
the 2.5 billion dollars

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.216
to send my own robot to Mars,
