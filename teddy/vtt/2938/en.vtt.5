00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.736
so it has adapted to live
with less than 0.1 percent

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880
of the amount of light
that regular plants need.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.016
These type of findings
suggest to me that on Mars,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.896
we may find even
photosynthetic life inside caves.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.296
And by the way, that's me.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.136
(Laughter)

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.896
Now, for almost 15 years
this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.936
was thought to be
the driest place of this desert,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.696
but I knew that it was not.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.096
How? You already know the answer.
