This is a picture of a sunset on Mars

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.816
Mars is a very cold planet,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.096
flooded with high levels of UV radiation

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.016
and extremely dry.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.160
In fact, Mars is considered
to be too dry for life as we know it.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.176
I'm an astrobiologist.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.096
I try to understand
the origin of life on Earth

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.336
and the possibilities of finding life

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.600
elsewhere in the universe.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.656
People sometimes ask me,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.856
how can you be an astrobiologist
