like walking mummies all around us,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.160
and that they may be using
UV radiation as a source of energy.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.456
If confirmed, this would have
a huge impact on our definition of life,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.000
on how we look for life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.776
Due to its clear skies, by 2020,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.456
60 percent of the biggest
telescopes on Earth

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.696
will be located in the Atacama,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.616
and while everyone else
will be looking among the stars

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.880
to answer the question, "Are we alone?"

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.696
I will be looking down to the ground

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.296
