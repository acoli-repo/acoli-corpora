Well, because I was born
and raised in the Atacama --

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.736
(Laughter)

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.776
So I had a unique advantage

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.840
when I started studying this desert.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.416
So let me tell you guys
a few fantastic examples

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.096
he has found

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.320
on how life has adapted
to live with almost no water at all.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.216
One of my first findings
was in the entrance of a cave

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.976
facing the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.696
In this place, we reported
a new type of microalgae

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.640
that grew only on top of the spiderwebs
that covered the cave entrance.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.760
Have you ever seen a spiderweb
early in the morning?
