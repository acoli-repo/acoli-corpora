How? You already know the answer.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.336
Because I was born
and raised in this desert.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.016
So I remembered that I
usually see fogs in Yungay,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.256
so after setting sensors
in a number of places,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.336
where I remember
never seeing fogs or clouds,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.376
I reported four other sites
much drier than Yungay,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.016
with this one, María Elena South,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.496
being the truly driest place on Earth,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.496
as dry as Mars,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.856
and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.160
from the small mining town
where I was born.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.416
Now, in this search, we were trying
to actually find the dry limit
