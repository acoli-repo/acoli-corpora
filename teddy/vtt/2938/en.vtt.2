to send my own robot to Mars,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.176
I study the most Martian place on Earth,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.736
the Atacama Desert.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.416
Located in northern Chile,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.056
it is the oldest
and driest desert on Earth.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.056
To give you an idea of how dry it is,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.120
consider here in Vancouver it rains
over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.496
In the Atacama, there are places
with no reported rains

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.320
in the last 400 years.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.576
How do I know this?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.096
Well, because I was born
and raised in the Atacama --
