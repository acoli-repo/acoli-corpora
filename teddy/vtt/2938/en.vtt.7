00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.416
Now, in this search, we were trying
to actually find the dry limit

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.656
for life on Earth,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.536
a place so dry that nothing
was able to survive in it.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.136
But even here, well hidden underground,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.576
we found a number
of different microorganisms,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.056
which suggested to me
that similarly dry places, like Mars,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.280
may be inhabited.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.656
We even have some preliminary evidences

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.216
that these microorganisms
may still be active

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.176
in the desiccated state,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.016
like walking mummies all around us,
