00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:30.080
or they're going to start following you
to see who you really are.

00:01:30.104 --> 00:01:32.454
Relief only comes
when you turn the first corner

00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:34.842
and glance behind,
and they're not standing there.

00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.352
But what our counterfeit
polo shirt seller certainly didn't realize

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:43.137
is that everything I'd seen and heard
would result in a dawn raid on his house,

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.948
him being woken out of bed
by eight men on his doorstep

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.362
and all his product seized.

00:01:48.557 --> 00:01:52.040
But this would reveal
that he was just a pawn

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:55.522
at the end of a counterfeiting network
spanning three continents,

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.664
and he was just the first loose thread
that I'd started to pull on

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.625
in the hope that it would all unravel.
