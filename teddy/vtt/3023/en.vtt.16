So whatever you think, this isn't
a faraway problem happening in China.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:07.551
It's happening right here.

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:10.885
And Paris is not unique.

00:08:11.642 --> 00:08:15.754
Ten years earlier, in 2004,
191 people lost their lives

00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:17.721
when a Madrid commuter train was bombed.

00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:22.561

as a good way of supporting terror cells.
