So here's a few tips
from one investigator to another

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.704
to get you started.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:35.910
Number one:

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:38.609
here's a typical
online counterfeiter's website.

00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:40.413
Note the URL.

00:09:40.923 --> 00:09:43.884
If you're shopping for sunglasses
or camera lenses, say,

00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:47.414
and you come across a website
like medical-insurance-bankruptcy.com,

00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:49.003
start to get very suspicious.

00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:50.553
(Laughter)

00:09:50.577 --> 00:09:52.849
Counterfeiters register
expired domain names

00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:56.149
as a way of keeping up
the old website's Google page ranking.

00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:58.552
Number two:

00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:02.059
is the website screaming at you
that everything is 100 percent genuine,
