00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:00.003
and in the 10 years since,
I've investigated fake car parts,

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:03.241
alloy wheels, fake pet grooming tools,

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:04.956
fake bicycle parts,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.107
and, of course,
the counterfeiter's favorite,

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:10.241
fake luxury leather goods,
clothing and shoes.

00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:13.901
And what I've learned in the 10 years
of investigating fakes

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.366
is that once you start
to scratch the surface,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.552
you find that they are rotten to the core,

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:23.314
as are the people and organizations
that are making money from them,

00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:26.805
because they are profiting
on a massive, massive scale.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.928
You can only make
around a hundred to 200 percent

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:31.466
selling drugs on the street.
