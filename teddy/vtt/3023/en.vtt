00:00:00.855 --> 00:00:04.321
Two years ago, I set off
from central London on the Tube

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:06.643
and ended up somewhere
in the east of the city

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:08.580
walking into a self-storage unit

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:12.199
to meet a guy that had
2,000 luxury polo shirts for sale.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.105
And as I made my way down the corridor,

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.122
a broken, blinking light made it
just like the cliche scene

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:19.343
from a gangster movie.

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:22.644
Our man was early,
and he was waiting for me

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:25.525
in front of a unit secured
with four padlocks down the side.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:27.580
On our opening exchange,

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.343
it was like a verbal sparring match

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.001
where he threw the first punches.
