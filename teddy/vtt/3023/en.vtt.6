Terrorists are selling fakes
to fund attacks,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.109
attacks in our cities
that try to make victims of all of us.

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:07.681
You wouldn't buy a live scorpion,

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.753
because there's a chance
that it would sting you on the way home,

00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:12.760
but would you still buy a fake handbag

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:16.283
if you knew the profits
would enable someone to buy bullets

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:19.672
that would kill you and other
innocent people six months later?

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:21.744
Maybe not.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:24.314
OK, time to come clean.

00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:25.819
In my youth --

00:03:25.843 --> 00:03:28.696
yeah, I might look like I'm still
clinging on to it a bit --

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.888
I bought fake watches
while on holiday in the Canary Islands.
