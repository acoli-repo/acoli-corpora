00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:03.360
and over two million finished
counterfeit clothing products were seized,

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:06.375
and it took 16 trucks
to take that all away.

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:08.718
But this gang had been clever.

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:12.130
They had gone to the lengths
of creating their own fashion brands,

00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:14.137
complete with registered trademarks,

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:16.662
and even having photo shoots
on yachts in Italy.

00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:22.782
And they would use these completely
unheard-of and unsuspicious brand names

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.448
as a way of shipping
container loads of fakes

00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:27.948
to shell companies
that they'd set up across Europe.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.846
And documents found during those raids
