00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.846
And documents found during those raids

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.244
found that they'd been falsifying
shipping documents

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.014
so the customs officials
would literally have no idea

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.228
who had sent the products
in the first place.

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:42.301
When police got access
to just one bank account,

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.139
they found nearly three million euros

00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:47.608
had been laundered out of Spain
in less than two years,

00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:49.711
and just two days after those raids,

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:53.200
that gang were trying to bribe a law firm
to get their stock back.

00:05:54.782 --> 00:05:57.846
Even now, we have no idea
where all that money went,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.036
to who it went to,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.353
but you can bet it's never going
to benefit the likes of you or me.
