00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.468
and after 20 minutes or so
of checking over the product

00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:06.007
for the telltale signs
of counterfeit production --

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.357
say, badly stitched labels
or how the packaging

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.206
had a huge brand logo
stamped all over the front of it --

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.126
I was finally on my way out,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.221
but not before he insisted
on walking down to the street with me

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:17.451
and back to the station.

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:21.905
And the feeling after these meetings
is always the same:

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.009
my heart is beating like a drum,

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.928
because you never know
if they've actually bought your story,

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:30.080
or they're going to start following you
to see who you really are.
