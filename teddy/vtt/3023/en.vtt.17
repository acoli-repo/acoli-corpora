00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:37.709
But despite this, despite the evidence
connecting terrorism and counterfeiting,

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:40.503
we do go on buying them,
increasing the demand

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:42.876
to the point where
there's even a store in Turkey

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.664
called "I Love Genuine Fakes."

00:08:46.688 --> 00:08:49.887
And you have tourists posing
with photographs on TripAdvisor,

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.648
giving it five-star reviews.

00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:54.736
But would those same tourists
have gone into a store

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.072
called "I Love Genuine Fake Viagra Pills"

00:08:58.096 --> 00:09:00.500
or "I Genuinely Love Funding Terrorism"?
