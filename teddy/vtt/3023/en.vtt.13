For a few years, I also used to attend
automotive trade shows

00:06:30.618 --> 00:06:33.301
taking place in huge exhibition spaces,

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:36.517
but away from the Ferraris
and the Bentleys and the flashing lights,

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.475
there'd be companies selling fakes:

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.190
companies with a brochure on the counter

00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:44.516
and another one underneath,
if you ask them the right questions.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.351
And they would sell me fake car parts,
faulty fake car parts

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:51.892
that have been estimated to cause
over 36,000 fatalities,

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:53.787
deaths on our roads each year.

00:06:55.182 --> 00:07:01.071
Counterfeiting is set to become
a 2.3-trillion-dollar underground economy,
