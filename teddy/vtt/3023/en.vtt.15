00:07:27.644 --> 00:07:33.620
stopped monitoring the communications
of Said and Cherif Kouachi,

00:07:33.644 --> 00:07:37.524
the two brothers who had been
on a terror watch list for three years.

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:40.772
But that summer, they were only
picking up that Cherif was buying

00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:42.855
fake trainers from China,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.514
so it signaled a shift away from extremism

00:07:45.538 --> 00:07:48.442
into what was considered
a low-level petty crime.

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:51.045
The threat had gone away.

00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:53.207
Seven months later,

00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.389
the two brothers walked into the offices
of Charlie Hebdo magazine

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.218
and killed 12 people, wounded 11 more,

00:07:59.242 --> 00:08:01.908
with guns from the proceeds
of those fakes.
