00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:02.059
is the website screaming at you
that everything is 100 percent genuine,

00:10:02.083 --> 00:10:05.290
but still giving you 75 percent
off the latest collection?

00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:08.431
Look for words like "master copy,"

00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:10.455
"overruns," "straight from the factory."

00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:14.321
They could write this all in Comic Sans,
it's that much of a joke.

00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:15.954
(Laughter)

00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:17.212
Number three:

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:19.112
if you get as far as the checkout page,

00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:24.399
and you don't see "https"
or a padlock symbol next to the URL,

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:27.035
you should really start thinking
about closing the tab,

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.337
because these indicate
active security measures

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.466
that will keep your personal
and credit card information safe.
