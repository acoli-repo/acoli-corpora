The hoodie is an amazing object.

00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:07.668
It's one of those timeless objects
that we hardly think of,

00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.348
because they work so well
that they're part of our lives.

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:12.343
We call them "humble masterpieces."

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.588
[Small thing.]

00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:14.905
[Big idea.]

the Hoodie]

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.976
The hoodie has been --
even if it was not called so --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.842
it's been an icon throughout history
for good and for bad reasons.

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.081
The earliest ones that we can trace

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.684
are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
