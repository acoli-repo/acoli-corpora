We know very well what the hoodie
has come to signify

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.624
in the past few years
in the United States.

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:40.191
When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old
African-American kid,

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:43.887
was shot by a neighborhood vigilante,

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:48.060
and Million Hoodie Marches happened
all over the United States,

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.172
in which people wore hoodies
with the hood up

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:54.345
and marched in the streets
against this kind of prejudice.

00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:56.986
It doesn't happen that often

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.811
for a garment to have
so much symbolism and history
