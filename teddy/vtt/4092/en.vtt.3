And then, around the 1980s,
it also gets adopted

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:35.085
by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders,

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.222
and it takes on this kind of
youth street culture.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:40.390
It was, at the same time,
super-comfortable,

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:41.565
perfect for the streets

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:45.117
and also had that added value of anonymity

00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:46.384
when you needed it.

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.062

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:52.938
who defies convention
of respectable attire for businesspeople.

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:57.362
But interestingly, it's also a way to show
how power has changed.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:00.015
If you're wearing a two-piece suit,
you might be the bodyguard.
