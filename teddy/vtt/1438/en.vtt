00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
where I get this thing to work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about doing anything about aging.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
namely, by actually doing something about it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to do that in two steps.
