00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.423
Women in the audience, I have
some

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:32.422
pretty bad news that you already know,

00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:35.079
and that's that every aspect of your
life

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.487
has been medicalized.

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.911
Strike one is when you hit puberty.

00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.247
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.

00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:44.063
It's a condition;

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:45.623
it has to be treated. Strike two

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:47.223
is if you get pregnant.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:50.319
That's been medicalized as
well.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.239
You have to have a high-tech experience

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.967
of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.574
Strike three is menopause.

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:02.911
We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy
