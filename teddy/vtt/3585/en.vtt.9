00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:30.796
You all have

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.732
a universally fatal condition.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.040
So, just take a moment.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.372
It's called pre-death.

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:43.444
Every single one of you has it, because
you have the risk factor for it,

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:45.188
which is being alive.

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:48.246
But I have some good news for you,
because

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:52.276
I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:56.205
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:58.797
we'll see if that happens for everyone,

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:02.092
you will be a pre-vivor.
