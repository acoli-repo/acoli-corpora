Well, he's right,

00:09:00.796 --> 00:09:03.876
but he didn't say to me,

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.563
well, you have pre-obesity or

00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:08.908
you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,

00:09:08.908 --> 00:09:12.284
better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:15.443
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:17.444
or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:19.484
So that's, to me,

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:21.115
a way forward.

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:23.479
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same
thing.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.015
He learned,

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:28.532
from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,

00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:33.407
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
wasn't swinging at every pitch
