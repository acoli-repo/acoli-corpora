00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:33.407
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
wasn't swinging at every pitch

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:38.167
like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.516
they like to pick up those guys.

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:44.105
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.344
the guys who like to walk,

00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:47.048
because getting on base by a walk

00:09:47.048 --> 00:09:49.816
is just as good, and in our healthcare
system

00:09:49.816 --> 00:09:51.256
we need to figure out,

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:52.832
is that really a good pitch

00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:55.750
or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.525
Thanks.
