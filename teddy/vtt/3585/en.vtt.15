00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:30.470
and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.133
or How Not to Order Tests.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:34.784
We have this system

00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:37.301
where that's what you do.

00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:39.926
And it actually took being a journalist

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.829
to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.048
there are no bad people,

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.925
there are just bad incentives.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.533
And that's actually true.

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:51.990
Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.300
So when you put another MRI in
every corner, you put a robot

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.838
in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.
