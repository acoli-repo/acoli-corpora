00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:30.414
Or even worse,

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:34.373
if you are diagnosed with something
eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:36.597
you get sued.

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:39.629
We have pharmaceutical companies that are
constantly trying to expand

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.973
the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:47.766
because that obviously helps their bottom line.
We have advocacy groups,

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:50.021
like the one that's come up with
pre-vivor,

00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:54.261
who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.390
so that they can raise more funds

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.005
and raise visibility, et cetera.

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.845
But this isn't actually,
