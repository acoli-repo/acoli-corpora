00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.332
Start with the doctor-patient
relationship. Doctors, most of them,

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:07.358
are in a fee-for-service system. They are
basically incentivized to do more --

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:09.015
procedures, tests,

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.681
prescribe medications.

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.046
Patients come to them,

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:16.046
they want to do something. We're
Americans, we can't just stand

00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:18.927

they want a drug.

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:22.702
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how

00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:25.022
you treat it. If the doctor
doesn't give you that,

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:26.846
you go somewhere else.

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:28.726
That's not very good for doctors'
business.

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:30.414
Or even worse,
