00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:32.307
we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with

00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:33.684
that in the green room.

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:38.037
We also refer to subclinical conditions.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:42.588
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,

00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:46.123
obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:49.556
One of my favorites is called
subclinical acne.

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:53.523
If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:57.652
which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.

00:01:57.652 --> 00:02:04.267
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.
