00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:33.861
case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.679
We have pre-cancerous lesions,

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.172
which often don't turn into cancer.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:41.028
And yet,

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:44.954
if you take, for example, subclinical
osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:46.607
the precondition,

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:49.014
otherwise known as osteopenia,

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:52.684
you would have to treat 270
women for three years

00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:54.884
in order to prevent one broken bone.

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:56.493
That's an awful lot of women

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.420
when you multiply by the number of women
who were diagnosed

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.309
with this osteopenia.
