We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.365
audience, I'd like to suggest

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:36.572

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.873
We've selected, at every point in this system,

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.860

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.839
a condition, in some cases.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.332
