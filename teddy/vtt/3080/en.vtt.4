Why do so many of us flounder

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:03.401
when we're trying
to recover from heartbreak?

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:06.080
Why do the same coping mechanisms

00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:09.228
that get us through all kinds
of life challenges

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:12.440
fail us so miserably
when our heart gets broken?

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.322
In over 20 years of private practice,

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:19.326
I have seen people
of every age and background

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.975
face every manner of heartbreak,

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.071
and what I've learned is this:

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.380
when your heart is broken,

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:30.294
the same instincts you ordinarily rely on
