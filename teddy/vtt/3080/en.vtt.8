Brain studies have shown

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.959
that the withdrawal of romantic love

00:04:03.983 --> 00:04:07.469
activates the same mechanisms
in our brain that get activated

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:12.530
when addicts are withdrawing
from substances like cocaine or opioids.

00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:15.335
Kathy was going through withdrawal.

00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:19.728
And since she could not have
the heroin of actually being with Rich,

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:24.227
her unconscious mind chose
the methadone of her memories with him.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.988
Her instincts told her
she was trying to solve a mystery,

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:29.942
but what she was actually doing

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.538
was getting her fix.
