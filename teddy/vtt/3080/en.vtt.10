00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:01.408
every second you spend
stalking your ex on social media,

00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:03.572
you are just feeding your addiction,

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.386
deepening your emotional pain

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.169
and complicating your recovery.

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:11.694
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey.

00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:15.886
It's a fight, and your reason
is your strongest weapon.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.704
There is no breakup explanation
that's going to feel satisfying.

00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:22.567
No rationale can take away
the pain you feel.

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.251
So don't search for one,
don't wait for one,

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:28.324
just accept the one you were offered
or make up one yourself

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:30.268
and then put the question to rest,
