00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.749
The relationship was everything
she hoped it would be.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:03.878
Six months later,

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:06.377
after a lovely weekend in New England,

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:09.943
Rich made reservations
at their favorite romantic restaurant.

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:12.803
Kathy knew he was going to propose,

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:15.850
and she could barely
contain her excitement.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.311
But Rich did not propose
to Kathy that night.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:20.968
He broke up with her.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.280
As deeply as he cared
for Kathy -- and he did --

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.331
he simply wasn't in love.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:29.409
Kathy was shattered.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:34.276
Her heart was truly broken,
and she now faced yet another recovery.
