00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:00.972
argued like crazy
and didn't speak for two days.

00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:06.648
What I tell my patients
is to compile an exhaustive list

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:09.069
of all the ways
the person was wrong for you,

00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:11.581
all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves,

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:13.973
and then keep it on your phone.

00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:15.040
(Laughter)

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:17.151
And once you have your list,

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.420
you have to use it.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.589
When I hear even a hint of idealizing

00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:24.706
or the faintest whiff
of nostalgia in a session,

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.714
I go, "Phone, please."

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.559
(Laughter)

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:31.616
Your mind will try to tell you
they were perfect.
