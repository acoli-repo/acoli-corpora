00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:01.879
They introduced each other
to their adult children after one month,

00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:04.408
and they moved in together after two.

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.556
When middle-aged people date,
they don't mess around.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.678
It's like "Love, Actually"
meets "The Fast and the Furious."

00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:13.264
(Laughter)

00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:17.063
Miguel was happier
than he had been in years.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.293
But the night before
their first anniversary,

00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:21.640
Sharon left him.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:26.138
She had decided to move to the West Coast
to be closer to her children,

00:08:26.162 --> 00:08:28.611
and she didn't want
a long-distance relationship.

00:08:29.404 --> 00:08:34.167
Miguel was totally blindsided
and utterly devastated.
