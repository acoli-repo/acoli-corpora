To fix your broken heart,

00:10:31.103 --> 00:10:34.962
you have to identify these voids
in your life and fill them,

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:36.563
and I mean all of them.

00:10:36.587 --> 00:10:38.316
The voids in your identity:

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.988
you have to reestablish who you are
and what your life is about.

00:10:42.012 --> 00:10:43.724
The voids in your social life,

00:10:43.748 --> 00:10:46.824
the missing activities,
even the empty spaces on the wall

00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:48.438
where pictures used to hang.

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:51.135
But none of that will do any good

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:54.406
unless you prevent the mistakes
that can set you back,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.406
the unnecessary searches for explanations,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.637
idealizing your ex instead of focusing
on how they were wrong for you,
