At some point in our lives,

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.847
almost every one of us
will have our heart broken.

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:11.203
My patient Kathy planned her wedding
when she was in middle school.

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:13.064
She would meet her future husband

00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:14.721
by age 27,

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.532
get engaged a year later

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.799
and get married a year after that.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:23.516
But when Kathy turned 27,
she didn't find a husband.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.780
She found a lump in her breast.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.403
She went through many months
of harsh chemotherapy

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:31.201
and painful surgeries,
