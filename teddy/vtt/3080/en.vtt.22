00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.637
idealizing your ex instead of focusing
on how they were wrong for you,

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.482
indulging thoughts and behaviors
that still give them a starring role

00:11:05.506 --> 00:11:07.117
in this next chapter of your life

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.683
when they shouldn't be an extra.

00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:12.867
Getting over heartbreak is hard,

00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:17.355
but if you refuse to be misled
by your mind and you take steps to heal,

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:20.054
you can significantly minimize
your suffering.

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:22.498
And it won't just be you
who benefit from that.

00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:24.577
You'll be more present with your friends,

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.815
more engaged with your family,

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:31.039
not to mention the billions of dollars
of compromised productivity
