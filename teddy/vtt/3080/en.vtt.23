00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:31.039
not to mention the billions of dollars
of compromised productivity

00:11:31.063 --> 00:11:33.156
in the workplace that could be avoided.

00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:36.741
So if you know someone who is heartbroken,

00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:38.832
have compassion,

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:42.606
because social support has been found
to be important for their recovery.

00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:44.551
And have patience,

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:48.812
because it's going to take them longer
to move on than you think it should.

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:50.874
And if you're hurting,

00:11:51.732 --> 00:11:52.915
know this:

00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:56.425
it's difficult, it is a battle
within your own mind,

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.649
and you have to be diligent to win.

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:00.478
But you do have weapons.
