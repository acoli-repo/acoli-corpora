in paying attention,

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:35.268
in being kind when we feel

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:39.476
Look at the explosion of art
and music and poetry

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.417
in this moment of our collective crisis.

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:45.559
It is in the darkest times

00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:49.768
that we have the chance
to find our deepest beauty.

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:53.393
So let this be our moment

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.351
to move forward

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.309
with the fierce urgency
of a new generation

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:05.434
fortified with our most profound
and collective wisdom.
