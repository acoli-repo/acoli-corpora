00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:31.333
sometimes feeling
like they wouldn't even survive.

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:35.059
And right before I left,

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:37.893
a huge rainstorm poured down.

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:41.518
And I was sitting in my little car
as the wheels stuck in the mud

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:43.601
thinking, "I'm never getting out of here,"

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.768
when suddenly there was
a tap on my window --

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:48.393
a woman who was beckoning
me to follow her,

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:49.684
and I did.

00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:51.309
Jumped out through the rainstorm,

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.559
we went down this little muddy path,

00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:56.559
through a rickety metal door,

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:58.268
inside a shack

00:12:58.292 --> 00:13:00.934
where a group of women
were dancing with abandon.
