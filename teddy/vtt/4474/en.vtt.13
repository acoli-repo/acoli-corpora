She cut me off.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.976

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.518
That straight-talking conversation
deepened my moral imagination.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.059
And I remember lying --

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:48.143

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.684
A fan.

00:06:58.708 --> 00:07:00.476
Dignity."
