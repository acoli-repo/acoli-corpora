Plato wrote that a country
cultivates what it honors.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:36.875
For too long, we have defined success
based on money, power and fame.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:42.667
Now we have to start the hard,
long work of moral revolution.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.476
By that I mean putting our shared humanity

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.875
and the sustainability of the earth
at the center of our systems,

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:54.059
and prioritizing the collective we,

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:56.000
not the individual I.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:04:00.583
What if each of us gave more
to the world than we took from it?
