maybe more than you see it yourself.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:34.434
I'll take on your problem
but I can't solve it for you --

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.542
that you have to learn to do.

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.893
For example, in Harlem
there's an organization

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:41.726
called City Health Works

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.976
that hires local residents

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.101
with no previous health care experience,

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:49.059
trains them to work with other residents

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:52.184
so that they can better control
chronic diseases like gout,

00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:53.875
hypertension, diabetes.

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:57.184
I had the great pleasure
of meeting Destini Belton,

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:58.518
one of the health workers,

00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:00.101
who explained her job to me.
