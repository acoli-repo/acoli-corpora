Several years ago I sat
with a group of women weavers

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.643
outside in a rural village in Pakistan.

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.893
The day was hot ...

00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:40.833
over 120 degrees in the shade.

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:46.476
I wanted to tell the women about
a company my organization had invested in

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.143
that was bringing solar light to millions
of people across India and East Africa,

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:55.059
and I had seen the transformative
power of that light

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:59.809
to allow people to do things
so many of us just take for granted.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:01.309
"We have this light" I said,
