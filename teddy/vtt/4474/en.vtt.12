00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:01.309
"We have this light" I said,

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.809
"costs about seven dollars.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.393
People say it's amazing.

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:08.101

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.351

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:24.893
"We don't have a fan.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.268
We have a light.

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.976

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.268
you can work more -- "
