00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.809
have impacted more than 300 million
low-income people,

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:36.643
and sometimes reshaped
entire sectors to include the poor.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.518
But you can't really talk
about moral revolution

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:42.893
without grounding it
in practicality and meaning,

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:47.226
and that requires an entirely
new set of operating principles.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.268
Let me share just three.

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:51.726
The first is moral imagination.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.851
Too often we use the lens
only of our own imagination,

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.893
even when designing solutions

00:04:56.917 --> 00:05:00.434
for people whose lives
are completely different from our own.
