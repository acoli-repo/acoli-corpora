00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:13.018
It's a hundred-billion-dollar industry

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:16.893
dependent on the labor of about
five million smallholder farming families

00:09:16.917 --> 00:09:20.518
who receive only a tiny fraction
of that 100 billion.

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:26.268
In fact, 90 percent of them
make under two dollars a day.

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:28.851
But there's a generation
of new entrepreneurs

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.934
that is trying to change that.
