00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.809
catastrophic climate change

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.934
and the cruel inequality
that has left us more divided

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.184
and divisive than ever in my lifetime.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.667
But what would I say to them?

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:14.375
I'm a builder, so I started
by focusing on technical fixes,

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:19.559
but our problems are too interdependent,

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.518
too entangled.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:24.684
We need more than a system shift.

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:26.559
We need a mind shift.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:31.417
Plato wrote that a country
cultivates what it honors.
