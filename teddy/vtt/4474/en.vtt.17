00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.393
in service of other people,

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.059
not themselves.

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:36.434
To succeed in my work
has required holding the tension

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:41.059
between the power of markets
to enable innovation and prosperity

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:45.309
and their peril to allow for exclusion

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.458
and sometimes exploitation.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.643
Those who see the sole purpose
of business as profit

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.018
are not comfortable with that tension,

00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:57.458
nor are those who have
no trust in business at all.

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:04.184
But standing on either side
negates the creative, generative potential
