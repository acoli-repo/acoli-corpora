You know, maybe you've heard
of the dark-skies movement,

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:05.893
which aimed to raise awareness
of the issue of light pollution

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:08.601
and create pockets of unilluminated night,

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.518
so that people and animals

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:15.726
could enjoy more natural cycles
of light and dark, night and day.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.059
Well, in much the same way,

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.934
there are people now raising awareness

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.518
of the issue of noise pollution

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.726
and trying to create
pockets of quiet in the ocean,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.583
so that marine life can enjoy
a more natural soundscape.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.809
This is important.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.393
Noise isn't just an irritation.
