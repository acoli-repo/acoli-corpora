00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:32.309
they managed to convince
the Global Ocean Observation System

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:33.601
to start including noise

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:36.184
as one of their essential
variables for monitoring,

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.000
alongside things
like temperature and salinity.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:41.476
We do know some things.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.101
We know that sonar can be as loud,
or nearly as loud,

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.976
as an underwater volcano.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.184
A supertanker can be as loud
as the call of a blue whale.

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:54.268
The noises we add to the ocean
come in all different frequencies

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:56.351
and can travel great distances.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:59.393
Seismic surveys off the East Coast
of the United States

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.768
can be heard in the middle
of the Atlantic.
