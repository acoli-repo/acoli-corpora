00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:31.059
If you put your head under the water,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:34.643
you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain,

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.768
singing whales, grunting fish,

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:38.684
even snapping shrimp.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.726
Altogether, that can create a soundscape

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.851
of maybe 50 to 100 decibels,

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.809
depending on where and when you are.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.601
But mankind's addition to that
has been dramatic.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:53.101
It's estimated that shipping has added
three decibels of noise to the ocean

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.976
every 10 years in recent decades.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.559
That might not sound like a lot,

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.726
but decibels are on a logarithmic scale,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.643
like the Richter scale for earthquakes.
