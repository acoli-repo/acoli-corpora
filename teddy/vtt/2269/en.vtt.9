00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.393
So sound of the same pressure
will have a different intensity

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.893
whether you measure it
in the air or underwater.

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:38.101
Then there's the fact that whales
don't have ears exactly like human ears.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.559
Creatures like zooplankton

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:43.101
don't even have what you would
consider to be ears.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.393
So what does this mean,

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:47.250
what is the impact
on all this marine life?

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.393
Perhaps the easiest thing
for scientists to assess

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.934
is the effect of acute noise,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.851
really loud sudden blasts

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.625
that might cause physical injury
or hearing loss.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.893
Beaked whales, for example,
can go into panicked dives
