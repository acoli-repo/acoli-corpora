00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:32.226
with all this additional
acoustic real estate.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.101
(Soft bubbling)

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:39.101
I like to think of them
having their own holiday,

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.434
feasting and finding mates.

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:43.518
Celebrating their own spot of calm

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:46.226
in an otherwise noisy world.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.518
Thank you.

00:12:47.542 --> 00:12:50.042
