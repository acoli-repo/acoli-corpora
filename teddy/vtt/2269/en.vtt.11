00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.018
can mow down a swath of zooplankton,

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:34.684
the tiny creatures near the base

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:37.958
or can deform scallop larvae
while they're developing.

Well, what about chronic noise,

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.268
the more pervasive issue
of raising background noise

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:45.768
from things like shipping?

That can mask or drown out
the natural soundscape.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:53.351

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:01.518
And some fish will spend more time
patrolling their borders
