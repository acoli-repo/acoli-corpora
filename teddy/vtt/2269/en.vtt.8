00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.768
can be heard in the middle
of the Atlantic.

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:04.768
In the 1960s, they did an experiment

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:08.018
where they set off a loud noise
off the coast of Perth, Australia,

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:10.476
and they detected it
as far away as Bermuda,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.375
20,000 kilometers away.

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.393
So what does all this
sound like to marine life,

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:19.684
what do they hear?

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:21.434
It's kind of difficult to describe.

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:24.643
Sound travels further, faster in water
than it does in air,

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.226
and it also packs a different punch.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.393
So sound of the same pressure
will have a different intensity
