00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:00.934
There are only 75, maybe 76, animals left

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.476
in this population.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.893
And they're facing a lot of challenges.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.434
There are chemical pollutants
in these waters,

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:11.726
and they are running low on the salmon
that they really rely on for food.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.393
And then there's noise.

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:16.143
When researchers studied these
and similar killer whales,

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:20.351
they found that they spend
between 18 and 25 percent less time

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.434
feeding in the presence
of loud boat noise.

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:26.351
And that's a lot for a species
that's already struggling

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:28.375
to find enough food to thrive.

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.976
The good news, as I heard
from all the researchers I spoke to,
