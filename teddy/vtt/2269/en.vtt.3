00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.393
Noise isn't just an irritation.

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:34.518
It can cause chronic stress,

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.268
or even physical injury.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:39.726
It can affect marine life's ability
to find food and mates

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.583
and to listen out for predators and more.

00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:47.018
Think of all the sounds
we inject into the ocean.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.934
Perhaps one of the most dramatic
is the seismic surveys

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.434
used to look for oil and gas.

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.684
Air guns produce loud blasts,

00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:57.143
sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds,

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.726
for months on end.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.809
And they use the reflections
of these sounds
