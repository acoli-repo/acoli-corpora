00:08:56.708 --> 00:09:00.268
where the southern resident killer whales
are feeding in late summer.

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:02.851
Slower ships are quieter ships.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.143
And because it's Canada, you can just ask,

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:06.434
it can be voluntary.

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:07.726
(Laughter)

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.643
(Applause)

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:15.768
In that 2017 trial,
most of the ships complied,

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:18.018
adding about half an hour
to their travel time,

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:20.809
and reducing noise by about 1.2 decibels

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:23.851
or 24 percent of noise intensity.

00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:26.643
This year, they decided
to extend the length of time

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.559
and the area over which
they're asking ships to slow down.

00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.958
So hopefully that has
a positive impact for these whales.
