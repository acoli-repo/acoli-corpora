00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:00.851
that boats can be made quieter.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.101
And they also have a target

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:05.809
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions
from global shipping

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:08.351
by 50 percent by 2050.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:11.434
And the great news is that
these two things go hand in hand.

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:14.958
On the whole, a more
efficient ship is a quieter ship.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:21.059
People have also invented quieter ways
of hammering in the giant posts

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:23.684
needed for giant
wind turbines, like this one,

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:26.684
and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.

00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:30.101
And there are some incentives
for using quieter technologies.
