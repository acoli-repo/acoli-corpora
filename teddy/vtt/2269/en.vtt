00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.833
This is the sound of orcas
off the coast of Vancouver.

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:10.417
(Whale chirps and squeaks)

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:14.309
They make these fantastic sounds
not just to communicate,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.476
but also sometimes to echolocate,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.917
to find their way around and to find food.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.059
But that can be tricky sometimes,

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.351
because, well, here is the sound
of a ship passing by,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.934
recorded underwater.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.042
(Screeching oscillating sound)
