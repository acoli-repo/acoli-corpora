00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:30.101
And there are some incentives
for using quieter technologies.

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:31.851
The European Union, for example,

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.351
has a healthy marine system
directive for 2020.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:38.268
And one of the ways that they define
a healthy marine system

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:41.518
is by how much noise
is going in those waters.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:45.268
But on the whole, most waters
remain completely unregulated

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:47.042
when it comes to ocean noise.

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.184
But again, most of
the scientists I spoke to

00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:53.018
said that there's real momentum
right now in policy circles

00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:54.518
to pay attention to this issue

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:57.226
and maybe do something about this issue.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.393
We already know enough to say
that quieter seas are healthier seas.
