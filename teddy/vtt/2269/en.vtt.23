00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.309
And these impacts don't act in isolation.

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.851
They act together, and they multiply.

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.309
So even for the ones
that are not so obvious,

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.000
we really need to pay attention to them.

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:41.851
I'll tell you about one last experiment,

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.476
just because it's so beautiful.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.768
So Rob Williams,

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:48.018
one of the researchers who works
on southern resident killer whales,

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:49.851
also does some work in Bali.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.934
And there, they celebrate
a Hindu tradition

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.809
called nyepi, or a day of silence.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:57.768
And this day, apparently,
is very strictly observed.

00:11:57.792 --> 00:11:59.851
No planes take off from the airport,

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.434
no boats go out fishing,
