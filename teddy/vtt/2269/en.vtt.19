00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.958
So hopefully that has
a positive impact for these whales.

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:36.851
In 2017, the Vancouver
Fraser Port Authority

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.768
also introduced discounts in docking fees

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:43.018
for ships that are physically
designed to be quieter.

00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:45.809
You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise
from a ship like this

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:49.476
comes from the popping of tiny bubbles
off the back of its propeller.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.601
And you can simply design a ship
to do less of that

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.518
and to be quieter.

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:58.309
The International Maritime Organization
has published a huge list of ways

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:00.851
that boats can be made quieter.
