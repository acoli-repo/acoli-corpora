00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:31.268
may be as befuddling and even dangerous

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.542
as a dense fog is for us.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:38.226
And maybe sometimes that just means
being a little more stressed,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.434
maybe sometimes it means
spending a little less time with the kids.

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:43.851
Maybe some species can adapt.

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.601
But some researchers worry
that for endangered species

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.018
already on the brink,

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.667
noise may be enough
to push them over the edge.

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:54.643
So take, for example,
the southern resident killer whales

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.559
that live in the waters
off my hometown of Vancouver.

00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:00.934
There are only 75, maybe 76, animals left
