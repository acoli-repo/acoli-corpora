00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.643
like the Richter scale for earthquakes.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.309
So a small number can actually
represent a large change.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:09.684
Three decibels means a doubling
of noise intensity in the ocean.

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:10.958
A doubling.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.143
And that's only an estimate,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.309
because no one is actually keeping track
of how noisy the ocean is

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.226
all around the world.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.309
There is a body called
the International Quiet Ocean Experiment,

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.601
and one of their missions

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:26.125
is to try and plug the hole in that data.

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.809
So for example, last year,

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:32.309
they managed to convince
the Global Ocean Observation System
