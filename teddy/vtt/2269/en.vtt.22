We already know enough to say
that quieter seas are healthier seas.

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:05.434
But now scientists are really scrambling
to come up with the details.

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:07.434
Just how quiet do we need to be?

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:11.934
And where are the best places
to make quiet or preserve quiet?

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.375
And how best can we hush our noise?

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:17.601
And you know, I'm not trying to tell you

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:20.518
that noise is the biggest
environmental problem on the planet

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:21.809
or even in the ocean.

00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:25.643
But the point is that humankind
has a lot of impacts

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:28.143
on our environmental system.

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.309
And these impacts don't act in isolation.
