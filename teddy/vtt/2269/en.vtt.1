00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.042
(Screeching oscillating sound)

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:34.643
You know, when we think
about marine pollution,

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.684
I think we usually think about plastics.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:38.309
Maybe toxic chemicals,

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.434
or even ocean acidification
from climate change.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.893
As a science journalist who often writes
about environmental issues,

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:47.059
those are the things
that have passed my desk

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.059
over the past 10 years or so.

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.351
But as I recently realized

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.434
when I was writing a feature
for the science journal "Nature,"

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.726
noise is another
important kind of pollution.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.417
One that often gets ignored.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.393
You know, maybe you've heard
of the dark-skies movement,
