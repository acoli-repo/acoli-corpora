Beaked whales, for example,
can go into panicked dives

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:02.726
when exposed to loud noises,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.167
which may even give them
a condition similar to the bends.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:11.518
In the 1960s, after the introduction
of more powerful sonar technologies,

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:15.434
the number of incidents of mass
whale strandings of beaked whales

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:16.875
went up dramatically.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:19.601
And it's not just marine mammals,

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:23.893
fish, if they stray too close
to the source of a loud sound,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:27.184
their fish bladders may actually explode.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:29.268
The airgun blasts from seismic surveys

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.018
can mow down a swath of zooplankton,
