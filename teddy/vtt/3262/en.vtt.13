00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.071
And how could scientists
spend their entire lives

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.586
studying dead Indians

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.687
but seem to care so little
about living ones?

00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.412
I graduated but wasn't sure
what to do next,

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.094
so I traveled.

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:48.596
One day, in South Africa,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.079
I visited Nelson Mandela's
former prison cell on Robben Island.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.477
I had an epiphany.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.774
Here was a man who helped
a country bridge vast divides

00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:02.695
to seek, however imperfectly,
reconciliation.
