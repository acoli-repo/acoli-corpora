00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:30.476
100 of them.

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:33.782
After months and then years,
we met with dozens of tribes

00:07:33.806 --> 00:07:36.082
to figure out how to get
these remains home.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.198
And this is hard work.

00:07:38.222 --> 00:07:42.301
It involves negotiating
who will receive the remains,

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.253
how to respectfully transfer them,

00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:46.007
where will they go.

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:50.341
Native American leaders
become undertakers,

00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:54.944
planning funerals for dead relatives
they had never wanted unearthed.

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:59.816
A decade later, the Denver Museum
and our Native partners

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.606
have reburied nearly all
of the human remains in the collection.
