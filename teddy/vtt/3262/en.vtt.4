In the 1880s, anthropologists
began to collect them

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:03.009
as evidence of American Indian religion.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.099
They came to be seen as beautiful,

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:12.096
the precursor to the stark sculptures
of Picasso and Paul Klee,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.643
helping to usher in
the modern art movement.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.806
From one viewpoint, the museum
did exactly as it's supposed to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.250
with the War God.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.693
It helped introduce
a little-known art form

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:26.583
for the world to appreciate.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.717
But from another point of view,

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:34.184
the museum had committed
a terrible crime of cultural violence.
