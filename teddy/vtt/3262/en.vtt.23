00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:31.021
And standing there,

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:34.488
I got a glimpse at the War Gods'
true purpose in the world.

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:37.161
And it occurred to me then

00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:41.240
that we do not get to choose
the histories that we inherit.

00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:45.178
Museum curators today
did not pillage ancient graves

00:11:45.202 --> 00:11:46.988
or steal spiritual objects,

00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:51.274
but we can accept responsibility
for correcting past mistakes.

00:11:52.232 --> 00:11:54.472
We can help restore dignity,

00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.933
hope and humanity to Native Americans,

00:11:57.957 --> 00:12:01.774
the very people who were once
the voiceless objects of our curiosity.
