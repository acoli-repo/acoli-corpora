where they live to protect the Zuni people

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.983
and keep the universe in balance.

00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:06.158
No one can own or sell a War God.

00:03:06.182 --> 00:03:08.379
They belong only to the earth.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:12.610
And so Zunis want them back from museums

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:14.744
so they can go to their shrine homes

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:18.792
to fulfill their spiritual purpose.

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:22.784
What is a curator to do?

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:27.056
I believe that the War Gods
should be returned.

00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:30.321
This might be a startling answer.
