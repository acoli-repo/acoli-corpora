contradicts the refrain

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.495
of the world's most famous archaeologist:

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.728
"That belongs in a museum!"

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.688
(Laughter)

00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:44.736
is what Indiana Jones said,
not just to drive movie plots,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.518
but to drive home the unquestionable good
of museums for society.

00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:53.544
I did not come to my view easily.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:56.377
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona,

00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:59.210
and fell in love
with the Sonoran Desert's past.
