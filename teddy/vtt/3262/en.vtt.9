Starting in the 1860s,

00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:35.254
Native American skeletons
became a tool for science,

00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:37.136
collected in the thousands

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.444
to prove new theories
of social and racial hierarchies.

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:47.243
Native American human remains
were plundered from graves,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.933
even taken fresh from battlefields.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.823
When archaeologists
came across white graves,

00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:57.283
the skeleton was often quickly reburied,

00:04:57.307 --> 00:05:02.326
while Native bones were deposited
as specimens on museum shelves.
