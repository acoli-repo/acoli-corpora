WEBVTT

00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:31.933
has now been returned -- 106, so far --

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:34.997
but there are more
beyond the reach of US law,

00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:37.988
in private collections
and outside our borders.

00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:44.329
In 2014, I had the chance to travel
with a respected religious leader

00:08:44.353 --> 00:08:48.195
from the Zuni tribe
named Octavius Seowtewa

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:50.908
to visit five museums
in Europe with War Gods.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.339
At the Ethnological Museum of Berlin,

00:08:54.363 --> 00:08:58.092
we saw a War God
with a history of dubious care.

00:08:58.443 --> 00:09:02.062
An overly enthusiastic curator
had added chicken feathers to it.
