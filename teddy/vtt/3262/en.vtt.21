00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.051
we have Zuni traditional pottery,

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:35.487
jewelry, tools, clothing and arts.

00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:39.288
And even more precious than these objects

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:42.645
are the relationships that we formed
with Native Americans

00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:45.295
through the process of repatriation.

00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:51.347
Now, we can ask Zunis
to share their culture with us.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.469
Not long ago, I had the chance
to visit the returned War Gods.

00:10:57.263 --> 00:11:02.791
A shrine sits up high atop a mesa
overlooking beautiful Zuni homeland.
