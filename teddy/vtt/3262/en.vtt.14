to seek, however imperfectly,
reconciliation.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.829
I'm no Mandela, but I ask myself:

00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:10.813
Could I, too, plant seeds of hope
in the ruins of the past?

00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:13.955
In 2007, I was hired as a curator

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:16.777
at the Denver Museum
of Nature and Science.

00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:20.013
Our team agreed that unlike
many other institutions,

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:24.587
we needed to proactively confront
the legacy of museum collecting.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.065
We started with
the skeletons in our closet,

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:30.476
100 of them.
