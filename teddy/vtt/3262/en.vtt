00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.810
A confession:

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.807
I am an archaeologist
and a museum curator,

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:09.020
but a paradoxical one.

00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:12.268
For my museum, I collect things,

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.700
but I also return things
back to where they came from.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.371
I love museums because
they're social and educational,

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.125
but I'm most drawn to them
because of the magic of objects:

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:28.292
a one-million-year-old hand axe,

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:31.270
a totem pole, an impressionist painting
