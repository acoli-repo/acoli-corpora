I'm a neuroscientist.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And in neuroscience,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But I want to start with the easiest question

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's a fundamental question

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if we want to understand brain function.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that is, why do we and other animals

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
have brains?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Not all species on our planet have brains,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so if we want to know what the brain is for,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
let's think about why we evolved one.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now you may reason that we have one

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to perceive the world or to think,
