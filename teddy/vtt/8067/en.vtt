00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:03.082
Picture this.

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:06.294
You have the opportunity
to own a beautiful home

00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:09.172
in a historic neighborhood
with deep cultural roots

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:12.633
designed by some of the best
urban planners in the world.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.219
all in a charming waterfront city.

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:16.929
You'd want to live here, right?

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:21.851
But what if I told you
that this home was in an area of Baltimore

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:23.811
called the Black Butterfly,

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.648
where block after block
of these beautiful historic row homes

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.651
sit vacant and are negatively valued,
