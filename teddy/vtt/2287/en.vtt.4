00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.268
We replaced that with a web form,

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:03.018
and now most veterans find out

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.393
if they can get access
to their health benefits

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.934
in 10 minutes.

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.726
(Applause)

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.684
Here's another launch that I'm proud of.

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:13.976

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.226
So this is a picture from before,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.726
and this is afterwards.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.184
Same cubicles, same people,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:26.500
just a better system for everyone.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:30.643
At one point, we wanted to celebrate
modernizing a different system,
