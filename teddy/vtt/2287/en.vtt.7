00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.976
So yes, there's some stuff
that's messed up in government right now.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.143
But if you think Silicon Valley
is the savior in this story,

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.434
(Laughs)

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:37.226
you've got another thing coming.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.101
Some of the best and brightest
minds in technology

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.101
are working on meal-delivery start-ups

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:43.393
and scooters

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:47.309
and how to deliver weed to people better.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.875
Is that really the most important thing
to work on right now?

00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:55.893
Silicon Valley likes to talk
about making the world a better place.

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:59.684
But you feel your impact
in a much more visceral way

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:00.958
in government.
