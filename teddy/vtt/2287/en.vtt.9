00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:30.601
I'm much more likely
to use words like civil servant.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.518
Like Francine, who can make you cry.

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.434
Or at least, she made me cry,

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:38.101
because she's so inspiring.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:42.101
I am also deeply, fiercely proud
of my colleagues.

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:45.518
They will work
through illogical situations

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:48.875
and put in late nights
to get to the right result.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:52.434
The government can't pay
huge salary bonuses,

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.726
so we ended up making our own awards.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.726
Our mascot is a crab named Molly.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.643
And so that award is actually
a crab-shaped purse,
