Hi everybody.

00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:03.351
My name is Matt Cutts,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.809
and I worked at Google
for almost 17 years.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.726

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.893
I was pretty close to the top
of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:16.934
Then I decided to follow
some inspiring folks

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.018
and do a short tour
at the US Digital Service.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:24.226
That's the group of geeks
that helped rescue HealthCare.gov

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.018
when that website went down hard in 2013.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.309
Yeah.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.934
So I signed up for
a three-to-six-month tour,
