If your last name starts with H or higher,

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.125
H or higher, would you raise your hand?

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:37.934
Wow.

00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.226
I have some bad news:

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.434
Your veteran records
might have been destroyed

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:42.768

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:43.809

If you're a veteran

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.351

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:54.643
using a paper form,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.851
you might have to wait months
for that form to be processed.

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.268
We replaced that with a web form,
