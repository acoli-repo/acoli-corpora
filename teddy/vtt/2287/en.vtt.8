00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:00.958
in government.

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.809
This is somebody whose dad passed away.

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.851
He hunted me down on Twitter

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:09.893
to say that a system that we had improved

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.375
worked well for him during a tough time.

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:16.434
Those tough times are
when government needs to work well

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:19.309
and why we need innovation in government.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.857
Now I have a confession to make.

00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.226
When I came to DC,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.101
I sometimes used words like bureaucrat.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.393
These days,

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:30.601
I'm much more likely
to use words like civil servant.
