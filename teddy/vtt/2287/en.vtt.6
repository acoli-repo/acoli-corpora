Now I've talked a lot about paper,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.976
but we also bring up
computer systems that go down.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.351
We bring in modern technology practices,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.601
like user-centered design and the cloud,

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.476
and we also help improve procurement.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.351
It turns out government buys software

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:22.143
the same way that it buys chairs
and brownies and tanks:

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:27.268
from government regulations
that are over 1,000 pages long.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.976
So yes, there's some stuff
that's messed up in government right now.
