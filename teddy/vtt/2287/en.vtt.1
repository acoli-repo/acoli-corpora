00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.934
So I signed up for
a three-to-six-month tour,

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.393
and almost three years later,

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.476
I'm still in Washington DC,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.226
working for the federal government,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.143
because the government
really needs technologists right now.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.434
At my old job,

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:46.059
every room had videoconferencing

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.268
integrated with calendars,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.393
power cables were built
right into the furniture.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.976
When I moved to a government agency,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.934
I had to call a person
to set up a phone conference.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.684
And when we moved to a new office,

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.559
we didn't have furniture for a while,
