At one point, we wanted to celebrate
modernizing a different system,

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.559
and so we went to a local grocery store

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:34.226
and we said, "Can you make a cake

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.184
and decorate it with the form
that we've digitized?"

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.768
And the grocery store
got really weirded out by that request.

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.893
They wanted a letter
on official government letterhead.

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:47.059
Well, we work for the government,
so we wrote a letter that said,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.476
"You can use this public-domain form

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.601
on a cake for celebratory purposes."

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.643
(Laughter)

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:57.601
Which led to bad jokes
about filling forms out in triplicake.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.476
Yes, dad jokes in government.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.309
Now I've talked a lot about paper,
