WEBVTT

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:33.433
We design objects and products
and structures and tools across scales,

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.228
from the large-scale,

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:38.768
like this robotic arm
with an 80-foot diameter reach

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.926
with a vehicular base that will
one day soon print entire buildings,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.037
to nanoscale graphics made entirely
of genetically engineered microorganisms

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.441
that glow in the dark.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.445
Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.842
an archetype of ancient
Arabic architecture,

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:58.430
and created a screen where
every aperture is uniquely sized

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:02.040
to shape the form of light and heat
moving through it.
