00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.684
Two twin domes,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:07.138
two radically opposed design cultures.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.749
One is made of thousands of steel parts,

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.549
the other of a single silk thread.

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:16.501
One is synthetic, the other organic.

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:19.213
One is imposed on the environment,

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.330
the other creates it.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.300
One is designed for nature,
the other is designed by her.

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:28.925
Michelangelo said that
when he looked at raw marble,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.401
he saw a figure struggling to be free.
