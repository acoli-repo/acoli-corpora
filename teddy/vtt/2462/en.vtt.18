00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:02.025
And here's the best part:

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:03.996
for objects designed to biodegrade,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.931
put them in the sea,
and they will nourish marine life;

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.566
place them in soil,
and they will help grow a tree.

00:09:12.415 --> 00:09:16.432
The setting for our next exploration
using the same design principles

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:18.177
was the solar system.

00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:22.975
We looked for the possibility
of creating life-sustaining clothing

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:25.167
for interplanetary voyages.

00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:31.745
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria
and be able to control their flow.
