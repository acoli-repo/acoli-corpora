00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.010
creates a highly
sophisticated architecture,

00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:02.835
a home inside which to metamorphisize.

00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:08.511
No additive manufacturing today gets even
close to this level of sophistication.

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:11.607
It does so by combining not two materials,

00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:14.940
but two proteins
in different concentrations.

00:13:15.487 --> 00:13:19.483
One acts as the structure,
the other is the glue, or the matrix,

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.928
holding those fibers together.

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:23.712
And this happens across scales.

00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:27.449
The silkworm first attaches itself
to the environment --

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.489
it creates a tensile structure --

00:13:29.513 --> 00:13:32.610
and it then starts spinning
a compressive cocoon.
