00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:00.005
and we placed it on our site.

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:05.373
We knew silkworms migrated
toward darker and colder areas,

00:15:05.397 --> 00:15:08.717
so we used a sun path diagram
to reveal the distribution

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.890
of light and heat on our structure.

00:15:11.692 --> 00:15:14.202
We then created holes, or apertures,

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.975
that would lock in the rays
of light and heat,

00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:21.714
distributing those silkworms
on the structure.

00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:25.150
We were ready to receive the caterpillars.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.893
We ordered 6,500 silkworms
from an online silk farm.
