00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:03.242
We 3D-printed our own channels
in order to control the flow

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.630
of these liquid bacterial cultures.

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:11.433
In our first piece of clothing,
we combined two microorganisms.

00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:13.368
The first is cyanobacteria.

00:10:13.392 --> 00:10:16.368
It lives in our oceans
and in freshwater ponds.

00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:20.315
And the second, E. coli, the bacterium
that inhabits the human gut.

00:10:20.862 --> 00:10:24.435
One converts light into sugar,
the other consumes that sugar

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:27.808
and produces biofuels
useful for the built environment.

00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:32.319
Now, these two microorganisms
never interact in nature.
