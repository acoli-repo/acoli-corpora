00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.211
You're probably asking yourselves:

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:32.385
Why now?

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:36.547
Why was this not possible 10
or even five years ago?

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.579
We live in a very special time in history,

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:42.675
a rare time,

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.278
a time when the confluence of four fields
is giving designers access to tools

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:49.552
we've never had access to before.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.069
These fields are computational design,

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:58.101
allowing us to design
complex forms with simple code;

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.159
additive manufacturing,
letting us produce parts
