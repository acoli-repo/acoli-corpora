To do that, we needed to contain bacteria
and be able to control their flow.

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:36.329
So like the periodic table, we came up
with our own table of the elements:

00:09:36.353 --> 00:09:39.742
new lifeforms that
were computationally grown,

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:41.807
additively manufactured

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.279
and biologically augmented.

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:49.621
I like to think of synthetic biology
as liquid alchemy,

00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:52.384
only instead of transmuting
precious metals,

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:56.147
you're synthesizing new biological
functionality inside very small channels.

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:58.519
It's called microfluidics.

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:03.242
We 3D-printed our own channels
in order to control the flow
