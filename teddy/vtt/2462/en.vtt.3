00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.082
Our back skins are thicker,
with small pores.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:36.177
One acts mainly as filter,

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.965
the other mainly as barrier,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.257
and yet it's the same skin:
no parts, no assemblies.

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:45.646
It's a system that gradually
varies its functionality

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.351
by varying elasticity.

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:51.777
So here this is a split screen
to represent my split world view,

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.205
the split personality of every designer
and architect operating today

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.548
between the chisel and the gene,

00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:03.410
between machine and organism,
between assembly and growth,
