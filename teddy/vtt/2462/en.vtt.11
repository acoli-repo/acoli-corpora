Its surface, as in nature,
varies its functionality

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.666
not by adding another material
or another assembly,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.409
but by continuously and delicately
varying material property.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:42.313
But is nature ideal?

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.288
Are there no parts in nature?

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:52.456
I wasn't raised
in a religious Jewish home,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.636
but when I was young,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.057
my grandmother used to tell me
stories from the Hebrew Bible,

00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:01.086
and one of them stuck with me and came
to define much of what I care about.
