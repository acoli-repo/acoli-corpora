to shape the form of light and heat
moving through it.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.715
In our next project,

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.949
we explore the possibility
of creating a cape and skirt --

00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:11.163
this was for a Paris fashion show
with Iris van Herpen --

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:13.975
like a second skin
that are made of a single part,

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.049
stiff at the contours,
flexible around the waist.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.789
Together with my long-term
3D printing collaborator Stratasys,

00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:26.820
we 3D-printed this cape and skirt
with no seams between the cells,

00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:28.840
and I'll show more objects like it.

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.865
This helmet combines
stiff and soft materials
