and one of them stuck with me and came
to define much of what I care about.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.118
As she recounts:

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:06.085
"On the third day of Creation,
God commands the Earth

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.625
to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:11.876
For this first fruit tree,
there was to be no differentiation

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.270
between trunk, branches,
leaves and fruit.

00:06:16.294 --> 00:06:18.443
The whole tree was a fruit.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.448
Instead, the land grew trees
that have bark and stems and flowers.

00:06:26.337 --> 00:06:29.710
The land created a world made of parts.
