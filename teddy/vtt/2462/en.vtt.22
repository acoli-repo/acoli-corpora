We then started growing
these channels on the human body,

00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:05.804
varying material properties
according to the desired functionality.

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:10.358
Where we wanted more photosynthesis,
we would design more transparent channels.

00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:16.205
This wearable digestive system,
when it's stretched end to end,

00:11:16.229 --> 00:11:18.293
spans 60 meters.

00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:20.975
This is half the length
of a football field,

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:24.348
and 10 times as long
as our small intestines.

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:28.320
And here it is for the first time
unveiled at TED --

00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:30.447
our first photosynthetic wearable,
