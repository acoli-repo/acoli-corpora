00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.865
This helmet combines
stiff and soft materials

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.001
in 20-micron resolution.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.413
This is the resolution of a human hair.

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.023
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.072
That designers have access

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:47.494
to such high-resolution
analytic and synthetic tools,

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:52.080
enables to design products that fit
not only the shape of our bodies,

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:55.612
but also the physiological
makeup of our tissues.

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:58.453
Next, we designed an acoustic chair,

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.689
a chair that would be at once
structural, comfortable
