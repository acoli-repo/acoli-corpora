a chair that would be at once
structural, comfortable

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:04.037
and would also absorb sound.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.975
Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I
turned to nature for inspiration,

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.684
and by designing this irregular
surface pattern,

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:14.079
it becomes sound-absorbent.

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.559
We printed its surface
out of 44 different properties,

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:21.976
varying in rigidity, opacity and color,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.999
corresponding to pressure points
on the human body.

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:30.015
Its surface, as in nature,
varies its functionality
