00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:32.319
Now, these two microorganisms
never interact in nature.

00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:34.201
In fact, they never met each other.

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:37.404
They've been here,
engineered for the first time,

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:40.784
to have a relationship
inside a piece of clothing.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.975
Think of it as evolution
not by natural selection,

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:46.817
but evolution by design.

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:49.714
In order to contain these relationships,

00:10:49.738 --> 00:10:53.843
we've created a single channel
that resembles the digestive tract,

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:58.369
that will help flow these bacteria
and alter their function along the way.

00:10:58.822 --> 00:11:02.451
We then started growing
these channels on the human body,
