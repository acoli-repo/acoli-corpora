00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:01.532
At least since the Industrial Revolution,
the world of design has been dominated

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.227
by the rigors of manufacturing
and mass production.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:07.975
Assembly lines have dictated
a world made of parts,

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:10.591
framing the imagination
of designers and architects

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.719
who have been trained to think
about their objects as assemblies

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:17.117
of discrete parts with distinct functions.

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:22.855
But you don't find homogenous
material assemblies in nature.

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.688
Take human skin, for example.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.622
Our facial skins are thin
with large pores.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.082
Our back skins are thicker,
with small pores.
