I often ask myself,

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:36.689
"What would design be like
if objects were made of a single part?

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:40.849
Would we return to a better
state of creation?"

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.954
So we looked for that biblical material,

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:49.631
that fruit-bearing fruit tree
kind of material, and we found it.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.250
The second-most abundant biopolymer
on the planet is called chitin,

00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:58.975
and some 100 million tons of it
are produced every year

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.855
by organisms such as shrimps,
crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
