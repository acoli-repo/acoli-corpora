00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.159
additive manufacturing,
letting us produce parts

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:05.809
by adding material
rather than carving it out;

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.277
materials engineering, which lets us
design the behavior of materials

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:11.018
in high resolution;

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:12.899
and synthetic biology,

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:16.999
enabling us to design new biological
functionality by editing DNA.

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.731
And at the intersection
of these four fields,

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.468
my team and I create.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.897
Please meet the minds and hands

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.317
of my students.

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:33.433
We design objects and products
and structures and tools across scales,
