00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:30.447
our first photosynthetic wearable,

00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:34.091
liquid channels glowing with life
inside a wearable clothing.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.822
(Applause)

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:38.895
Thank you.

00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:43.847
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned
creatures, but only half made up."

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.752
What if design could provide
that other half?

00:11:47.776 --> 00:11:52.583
What if we could create structures
that would augment living matter?

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.468
What if we could create
personal microbiomes

00:11:57.492 --> 00:12:01.367
that would scan our skins,
repair damaged tissue
