00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.855
by organisms such as shrimps,
crabs, scorpions and butterflies.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.975
We thought if we could tune
its properties,

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.627
we could generate structures
that are multifunctional

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.211
out of a single part.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:11.979
So that's what we did.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.992
We called Legal Seafood --

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:16.052
(Laughter)

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:18.933
we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,

00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:22.027
we grinded them
and we produced chitosan paste.

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.547
By varying chemical concentrations,

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.865
we were able to achieve
a wide array of properties --

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.666
from dark, stiff and opaque,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.006
to light, soft and transparent.
