00:13:29.513 --> 00:13:32.610
and it then starts spinning
a compressive cocoon.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:36.530
Tension and compression,
the two forces of life,

00:13:36.554 --> 00:13:39.608
manifested in a single material.

00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:44.548
In order to better understand
how this complex process works,

00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:46.759
we glued a tiny earth magnet

00:13:46.783 --> 00:13:49.782
to the head of a silkworm,
to the spinneret.

00:13:49.806 --> 00:13:52.754
We placed it inside a box
with magnetic sensors,

00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:55.865
and that allowed us to create
this 3-dimensional point cloud

00:13:55.889 --> 00:14:00.831
and visualize the complex architecture
of the silkworm cocoon.
