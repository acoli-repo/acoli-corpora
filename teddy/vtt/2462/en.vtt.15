00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.006
to light, soft and transparent.

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.629
In order to print the structures
in large scale,

00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:40.080
we built a robotically controlled
extrusion system with multiple nozzles.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.548
The robot would vary
material properties on the fly

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:48.675
and create these 12-foot-long structures
made of a single material,

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:51.441
100 percent recyclable.

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:54.139
When the parts are ready,
they're left to dry

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:57.742
and find a form naturally
upon contact with air.

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:02.242
So why are we still
designing with plastics?
