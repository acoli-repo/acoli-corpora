00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:03.415
Every year, more than four
to five million people die

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.716
due to exposure to outdoor air pollution

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.890
around the world.

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.774
This petri dish that you are looking at

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:14.903
contains approximately
20 minutes' worth of pollution

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:16.993
captured off a pyrolysis plant.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.616
This is PM 2.5.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.806
These particles --
you can see it right now,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.655
but when they're out there
in the air, you won't see them.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.648
These are so tiny that our lungs --

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:30.998
our bodies cannot filter them,
and they end up in our bodies --
