00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And I promised to come back and give you an update

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
on how that machine worked.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Its job is to recreate the conditions

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
up to 600 million times a second.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's nothing if not ambitious.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is the machine below Geneva.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --
