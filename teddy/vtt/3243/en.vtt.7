I realized then that to learn to fly,
we were going to have to learn to land.

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:37.292
My hero, Evel Knievel --
one of them -- said,

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.564
"Anyone can jump a motorcycle.

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:41.980
The trouble begins
when you try to land it."

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.086
(Laughter)

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:46.630
Landing hurts.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.113
I was curious, though.

00:03:49.137 --> 00:03:52.551
I thought, "Well, why don't we invent
an impact technique?

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:55.530
Why don't we just expand
our base of support?"

00:03:55.554 --> 00:03:57.698
I had seen pieces of plywood fall,

00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.048
and they didn't flinch on the way down.
