Birds and butterflies?
Minutes, maybe hours.

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:04.234
And what about fear?

00:03:04.892 --> 00:03:08.058
I think fear is complex and personal.

00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:11.410
I really think it has to do with curiosity

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:14.176
and not taking yourself so seriously.

00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:16.896
We might need to get a little hurt,

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:19.395
just not too hurt.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:22.079
And pain: redefine it.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.415
Rather than "pain," say, "another
rather interesting, foreign sensation."

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:28.629
Something like that.
