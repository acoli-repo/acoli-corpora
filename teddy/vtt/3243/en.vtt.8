00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.048
and they didn't flinch on the way down.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.595
So I made my body into a perfect line

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.037
and tilted back.

00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.251
Whaft!

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.896
It was a totally different
sound than "wham-o."

00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:11.596
And I rushed out onto
the streets of New York City

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.358
and went up to complete strangers,

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:15.341
and I said -- well, I thought --

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.595
"I did a backfall today. Did you?"

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:23.684
In 1985, we started to tour
all over the world a little bit,

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:25.888
and I started my company,

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:27.652
called STREB EXTREME ACTION.

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:31.355
In 2003, we were invited
to go to Kitty Hawk
