Hasn't everyone here dreamt of flying?

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:10.521
So why haven't humans flown yet?

00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:14.309
I've been obsessed with
learning to fly my whole life.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:19.453
I grew up a feral, adopted child
on the northern shore of Lake Ontario,

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:23.656
following my bricklayer/fisherman
father around.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.254
I was always fascinated
by things that moved,

00:00:26.278 --> 00:00:29.358

holding them in my hands,

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.269
feeling the magic of their movement;
