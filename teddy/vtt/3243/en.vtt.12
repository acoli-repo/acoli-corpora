00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.462
In 2012, we brought all
of our best machines to London

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.809
and put them in their most iconic places.

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:06.766
We got on the London Eye.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.214
It was 443 feet above the earth.

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:13.714
And as we reached the zenith,
we unlocked our brake and fell --

00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.202
200 feet on the radius,

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.534
on the spoke that we were attached to.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.306
We reached as far up as heaven that day,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.873
I'm pretty sure of it.

00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:26.793
And then I and two of my dancers

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:29.261
walked down the outside
of London's City Hall.

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:32.545
As I stood up there,
300 feet above the ground,
