In 2003, we were invited
to go to Kitty Hawk

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.571
to celebrate the 100th anniversary
of flight with the Wright Brothers.

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:37.873
We had gotten very good at landing;

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:40.315
now we needed to get up into the air.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.888
And like them, we wanted
to stay there longer.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.889
I came across this quote by Wilbur:

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:50.442
"If you are looking for perfect safety,
you will do well to sit on a fence

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.055
and watch the birds;

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.506
but if you really wish to learn,
you must mount a machine

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.690
and become acquainted
with its tricks by actual trial."

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.516
Ah, machines.
