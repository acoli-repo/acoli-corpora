00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:31.018
And a human's first bout with flying
was falling accidentally, tripping,

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:34.039
or slipping on that fabled banana peel.

00:01:34.603 --> 00:01:38.143
Once your ground is dragged
out from under you,

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.051
a world of wonder comes rushing in.

00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:44.483
I had found my territory.

00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:46.980
I was seized with a compulsion,

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.041
a primordial urge to learn how to fly,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:51.228
like a human.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.877
For the next 10 years,
I did my experiments alone,

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:56.262
on my own body.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.370
I drove my Honda 350
across the United States

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.424
in an "Easy Rider" kind of way.
