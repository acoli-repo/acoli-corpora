00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:30.703
That hurt.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:31.754
(Laughter)

00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:35.806
And it occurred to me that people
didn't really enjoy getting hurt,

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.609
and that maybe the reason
that we weren't flying yet

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:42.027
is that we were still attached
to that false idea

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.848
that we would fly the way birds do,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:46.581
or butterflies.

00:02:46.605 --> 00:02:50.335
Maybe we needed to assumption-bust,

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.195
to ask a different kind of question --

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.798
about duration, for instance.

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:57.449
Humans in the air? A few seconds.

00:02:57.473 --> 00:03:02.003
Birds and butterflies?
Minutes, maybe hours.
