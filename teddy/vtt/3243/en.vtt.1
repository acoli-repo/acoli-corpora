00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.269
feeling the magic of their movement;

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:34.086
playing with fire,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.940
thrilled and terrified at
its unrelenting force,

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:40.980
accidentally burning
my father's barn down --

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.323
just once.

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:43.896
(Laughter)

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.417
That was my first brush with real danger,

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:48.565
the fire and my father.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:53.582
When I was about eight or nine years old,
I caught a fly in a mason jar.

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.868
Studying that fly, I thought, "Wow,

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:59.479
it's changing directions
in midair with acute angles,

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.835
and it's going so fast, it's a blur.
