00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.424
in an "Easy Rider" kind of way.

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.985
I got my degree in modern dance.
I mimicked that fly in the box.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.062
I dove horizontally through glass;

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.961
on the way, I punched a hole in it.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.819
I was trying to figure out
something about flight.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.914
When I was 27 years old,

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:20.950
I found myself in a rat-infested
New York City loft,

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.282
getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:25.435
I climbed higher, higher, higher,

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.673
and I jumped.

00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:28.899
Wham-o! I landed.

00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:30.703
That hurt.
