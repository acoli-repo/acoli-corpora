00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.516
Ah, machines.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.160
It incited the hardware
junkie inside of me.

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:08.963
And if we did want to go or travel
to unhabitual places in space --

00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:12.430
to that banana peel spot that confuses us;

00:05:12.454 --> 00:05:15.783
to that place outside
our vertical comfort zone,

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:18.967
where we encounter unexpected turbulence

00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:22.165
and get accelerated oddly,

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.687
where the ground changes
and moves out from under us --

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.540
like the composer
who is trying to hit a note

00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:31.199
higher than the human voice can sing,
