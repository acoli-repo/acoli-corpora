00:00:00.502 --> 00:00:05.787
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.

00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:07.930
where we are looking to find

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.470
alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.278
That's what we're after.

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:16.458
And we do this because we actually believe

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:19.732
that silicon technology today is mostly about

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.484
a culture of excess.

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.657
It's about the fastest and the most efficient

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.087
and the most dazzling gadget you can have,

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.985
while about two-thirds of the world

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.669
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology
