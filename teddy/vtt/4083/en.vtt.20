00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:02.803
And on your right side,
you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,

00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:04.913
using only graphite on paper.

00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:08.891
Emma McNally is one of the main
leaders of this movement,

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:11.484
and she creates these striking,
imaginary landscapes,

00:10:11.508 --> 00:10:16.173
where you can really notice the influence
from traditional network visualization.

00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:21.331
But networkism doesn't happen
only in two dimensions.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.633
This is perhaps
one of my favorite projects

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:25.062
of this new movement.

00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:27.720
And I think the title really
says it all -- it's called:

00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:29.911
"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,

00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:33.267
Like Droplets Along the Strands
of a Spider's Web."
