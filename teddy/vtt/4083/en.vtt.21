Like Droplets Along the Strands
of a Spider's Web."

00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:37.696
And I just find this particular project
to be immensely powerful.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.680
It was created by Tomás Saraceno,

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.402
and he occupies these large spaces,

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:45.768
creates these massive installations
using only elastic ropes.

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.609
As you actually navigate that space
and bounce along those elastic ropes,

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:54.208
the entire network kind of shifts,
almost like a real organic network would.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:57.446
And here's yet another example

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.859
of networkism taken
to a whole different level.
