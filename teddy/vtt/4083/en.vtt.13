00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:31.253
in the way we classify
and organize species.

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.074
The image on the right
is the only illustration

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:39.210
that Darwin included
in "The Origin of Species,"

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.495
which Darwin called the "Tree of Life."

00:06:42.098 --> 00:06:44.983
There's actually a letter
from Darwin to the publisher,

00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:47.663
expanding on the importance
of this particular diagram.

00:06:47.687 --> 00:06:50.329
It was critical for Darwin's
theory of evolution.

00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:54.975
But recently, scientists discovered
that overlaying this tree of life

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.434
is a dense network of bacteria,

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.619
and these bacteria
are actually tying together

00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:01.815
species that were completely
separated before,
