00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:31.535
we can really understand
how human knowledge is much more intricate

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.995
and interdependent, just like a network.

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.618
We can also see this interesting shift

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:40.342
in the way we map
social ties between people.

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.819
This is the typical organization chart.

00:04:43.843 --> 00:04:46.637
I'm assuming many of you have seen
a similar chart as well,

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.407
in your own corporations, or others.

It's a top-down structure

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.801
that normally starts
with the CEO at the very top,

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.785
and where you can drill down all the way
to the individual workmen on the bottom.

00:04:57.634 --> 00:05:02.482
But humans sometimes are, well, actually,
all humans are unique in their own way,
