00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:03.516
This was created
by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.295
in a piece called "In Silence."

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:11.189
And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno,
fills these rooms with this dense network,

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.975
this dense web of elastic ropes
and black wool and thread,

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.758
sometimes including objects,
as you can see here,

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:20.804
sometimes even including people,
in many of her installations.

00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:26.065
But networks are also
not just a new trend,

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:28.453
and it's too easy for us
to dismiss it as such.

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:32.636
Networks really embody
notions of decentralization,
