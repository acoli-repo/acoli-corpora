00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:00.570
they are in many ways influencing
traditional art fields,

00:09:00.594 --> 00:09:01.996
like painting and sculpture,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.013
and influencing many different artists.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:08.760
And perhaps because networks have
this huge aesthetical force to them --

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.742
they're immensely gorgeous --

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.822
they are really becoming a cultural meme,

00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:17.171
and driving a new art movement,
which I've called "networkism."

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:21.752
And we can see this influence
in this movement in a variety of ways.

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:23.569
This is just one of many examples,

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:26.318
where you can see this influence
from science into art.

00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:29.213
The example on your left side
is IP-mapping,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:32.896
a computer-generated map of IP addresses;
again -- servers, machines.
