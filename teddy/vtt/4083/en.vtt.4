00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:03.083
And trees ultimately became
such a powerful visual metaphor

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:05.975
because in many ways,
they really embody this human desire

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.035
for order, for balance,
for unity, for symmetry.

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.322
However, nowadays we are really facing
new complex, intricate challenges

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:18.536
that cannot be understood by simply
employing a simple tree diagram.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.279
And a new metaphor is currently emerging,

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:25.453
and it's currently replacing the tree

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:28.040
in visualizing various
systems of knowledge.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:32.316
It's really providing us with a new lens
to understand the world around us.
