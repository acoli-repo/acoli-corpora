00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.421
Over the past 10 years,

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:07.014
I've been researching the way
people organize and visualize information.

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:09.825
And I've noticed an interesting shift.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.886
For a long period of time,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.338
we believed in a natural ranking order
in the world around us,

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:21.107
also known as the great chain of being,
or "Scala naturae" in Latin,

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:25.306
a top-down structure that normally starts
with God at the very top,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.735
followed by angels, noblemen,

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.772
common people, animals, and so on.
