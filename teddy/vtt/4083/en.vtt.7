And Llull was actually the precursor,

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.547
the very first one who created
the metaphor of science as a tree,

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.539
a metaphor we use
every single day, when we say,

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:40.228
"Biology is a branch of science,"

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.405
when we say,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.362
"Genetics is a branch of science."

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:47.878
But perhaps the most beautiful of all
trees of knowledge, at least for me,

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:52.354
was created for the French encyclopedia
by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:55.013
This was really the bastion
of the French Enlightenment,

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:58.862
and this gorgeous illustration
was featured as a table of contents

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:00.457
for the encyclopedia.
