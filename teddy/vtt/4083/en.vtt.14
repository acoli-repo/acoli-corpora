00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:01.815
species that were completely
separated before,

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.919
to what scientists are now calling
not the tree of life,

00:07:04.943 --> 00:07:07.799
but the web of life, the network of life.

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.003
And finally, we can really
see this shift, again,

00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:14.451
when we look at ecosystems
around our planet.

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.765
No more do we have these simplified
predator-versus-prey diagrams

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.236
we have all learned at school.

00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.190
This is a much more accurate
depiction of an ecosystem.

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:27.118
This is a diagram created
by Professor David Lavigne,

00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:30.642
mapping close to 100 species
that interact with the codfish
