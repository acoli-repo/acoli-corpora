It's really providing us with a new lens
to understand the world around us.

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.694
And this new metaphor
is the metaphor of the network.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.822
And we can see this shift
from trees into networks

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.486
in many domains of knowledge.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.699
We can see this shift in the way
we try to understand the brain.

00:02:48.453 --> 00:02:50.491
While before, we used
to think of the brain

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.506
as a modular, centralized organ,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.568
where a given area was responsible
for a set of actions and behaviors,

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:58.331
the more we know about the brain,

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.641
the more we think of it
as a large music symphony,
