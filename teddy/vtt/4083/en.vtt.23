00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:32.636
Networks really embody
notions of decentralization,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.794
of interconnectedness, of interdependence.

00:11:36.303 --> 00:11:38.779
And this new way of thinking is critical

00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:42.533
for us to solve many of the complex
problems we are facing nowadays,

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.398
from decoding the human brain,

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.825
to understanding
the vast universe out there.

00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:52.235
On your left side, you have a snapshot
of a neural network of a mouse --

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.679
very similar to our own
at this particular scale.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.466
And on your right side, you have
the Millennium Simulation.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.238
It was the largest
and most realistic simulation
