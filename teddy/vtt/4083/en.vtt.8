for the encyclopedia.

00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.668
And it actually maps out
all domains of knowledge

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:06.810
as separate branches of a tree.

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.199
But knowledge is much more
intricate than this.

00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:15.434
These are two maps of Wikipedia
showing the inter-linkage of articles --

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.348
related to history on the left,
and mathematics on the right.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.705
And I think by looking at these maps

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.273
and other ones that have been
created of Wikipedia --

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.689
arguably one of the largest rhizomatic
structures ever created by man --

00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:31.535
we can really understand
how human knowledge is much more intricate
