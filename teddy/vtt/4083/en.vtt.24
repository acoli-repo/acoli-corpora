WEBVTT

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.238
It was the largest
and most realistic simulation

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.052
of the growth of cosmic structure.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.006
It was able to recreate the history
of 20 million galaxies

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.120
in approximately 25 terabytes of output.

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:13.494
And coincidentally or not,

00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:15.391
I just find this particular comparison

00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:18.118
between the smallest scale
of knowledge -- the brain --

00:12:18.142 --> 00:12:20.971
and the largest scale of knowledge --
the universe itself --

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:23.272
to be really quite striking
and fascinating.

00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:26.441
Because as Bruce Mau once said,

00:12:26.465 --> 00:12:28.877
"When everything is connected
to everything else,

00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.298
for better or for worse,
everything matters."
