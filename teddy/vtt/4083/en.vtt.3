We can also see trees being used
to map genealogy,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.040
perhaps the most famous archetype
of the tree diagram.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:36.380
I think many of you in the audience
have probably seen family trees.

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:40.109
Many of you probably even have
your own family trees drawn in such a way.

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.069
We can see trees even mapping
systems of law,

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:47.944
the various decrees and rulings
of kings and rulers.

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:53.543
And finally, of course,
also a very popular scientific metaphor,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:57.127
we can see trees being used
to map all species known to man.

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:03.083
And trees ultimately became
such a powerful visual metaphor
