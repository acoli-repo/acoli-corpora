00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.869
And what they did here is,
they actually segmented the network

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:04.392
into three different years,

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:07.458
represented by the vertical layers
that you see behind me.

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:09.451
And the blue lines tie together

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.093
the people that were present
in that network year after year.

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.145
So even though there's no leader per se,

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.804
these people are probably the most
influential ones in that organization,

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:20.836
the ones that know more about the past,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.737
and the future plans and goals
of this particular cell.

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:28.238
We can also see this shift
from trees into networks

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:31.253
in the way we classify
and organize species.
