00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:13.031
For most of the year, the Gulf of Mexico
is teeming with marine life,

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.630
from tiny crustaceans 
to massive baleen whales.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.310
But every summer, disaster strikes.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.180
Around May, 
animals begin to flee the area.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.879
And soon, creatures that can’t swim 
or can’t swim fast enough

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.969
begin to suffocate and die off
in massive numbers.
