Fifth -- and in my point of view,
this is the most critical --

00:09:32.246 --> 00:09:36.550
today, our social media experiences
are designed in a way

00:09:36.574 --> 00:09:39.511
that favors broadcasting over engagements,

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.554
posts over discussions,

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:45.258
shallow comments over deep conversations.

00:09:45.764 --> 00:09:49.814
It's as if we agreed that
we are here to talk at each other

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:52.094
instead of talking with each other.

00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:55.680
I witnessed how these
critical challenges contributed

00:09:55.704 --> 00:09:59.017
to an already polarized
Egyptian society,

00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.154
but this is not just about Egypt.
