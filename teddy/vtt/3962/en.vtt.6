00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.088
Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.866
after mounting protests
against his regime.

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.462
I saw a spark of hope.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.326
Egyptians on social media were wondering,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.691
"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:14.907
I posted an event
on Facebook and called it

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:19.738
"A Revolution against Corruption,
Injustice and Dictatorship."

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:25.142
I posed a question to the 300,000 users
of the page at the time:

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.301
"Today is the 14th of January.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.220
The 25th of January is Police Day.
