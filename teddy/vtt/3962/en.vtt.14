00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.394
People in the center, like me,

00:07:01.418 --> 00:07:03.118
started feeling helpless.

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.087
Both groups wanted you to side with them;

00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:09.362
you were either with them or against them.

00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:12.639
And on the 3rd of July 2013,

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:17.170
the army ousted Egypt's first
democratically elected president,

00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:21.765
after three days of popular protest
that demanded his resignation.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:25.214
That day I made a very hard decision.

00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:29.535
I decided to go silent, completely silent.
