And it made it impossible
for the regime to stop it.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.050
At the time, they didn't
even understand it.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:13.889
And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded
the streets of Cairo and other cities,

00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:15.887
calling for change,

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.206
breaking the barrier of fear

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.129
and announcing a new era.

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:23.552
Then came the consequences.

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:29.371
A few hours before the regime cut off
the Internet and telecommunications,

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:33.343
I was walking in a dark street
in Cairo, around midnight.
