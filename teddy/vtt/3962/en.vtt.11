00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:31.572
My colleagues at Google started
a search campaign trying to find me,

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:35.578
and the fellow protesters in the square
demanded my release.

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.540
After 11 days of complete darkness,

00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:39.784
I was set free.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.128
And three days later,

00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:44.714
Mubarak was forced to step down.

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:49.649
It was the most inspiring
and empowering moment of my life.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.225
It was a time of great hope.

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:56.914
Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days
during the revolution.

00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:59.557
They all shared the belief

00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:03.873
that we could actually live together
despite our differences,
