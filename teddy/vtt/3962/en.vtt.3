In June 2010,

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:33.712
Internet changed my life forever.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.532
While browsing Facebook,

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:42.815
I saw a photo, a terrifying photo,
of a tortured, dead body

00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:45.373
of a young Egyptian guy.

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.016
His name was Khaled Said.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.361
Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian
who was killed by police.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.012
I saw myself in his picture.

00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:00.004
I thought, "I could be Khaled."
