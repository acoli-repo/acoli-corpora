I thought, "I could be Khaled."

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:04.923
I could not sleep that night,
and I decided to do something.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.043
I anonymously created a Facebook page

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:11.407
and called it "We are all Khaled Said."

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:17.270
In just three days, the page
had over 100,000 people,

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:20.898
fellow Egyptians who shared
the same concern.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.790
Whatever was happening had to stop.

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.401
I recruited my co-admin,
AbdelRahman Mansour.

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.932
We worked together for hours and hours.
