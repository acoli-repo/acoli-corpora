WEBVTT

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:32.023
The same tool that united us
to topple dictators

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.229
eventually tore us apart.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.124
I would like to share my own experience
in using social media for activism,

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:44.679
and talk about some of the challenges
I have personally faced

00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:46.528
and what we could do about them.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.580
In the early 2000s,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.219
Arabs were flooding the web.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.580
Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:00.316
for connecting with the rest
of the people around the globe,
