and redesign its experiences

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:04.906
to reward thoughtfulness, civility
and mutual understanding.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:08.843
As a believer in the Internet,
I teamed up with a few friends,

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:10.350
started a new project,

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:14.179
trying to find answers
and explore possibilities.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.169
Our first product is a new
media platform for conversations.

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:22.239

that promote mutual understanding

00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:24.018
and hopefully change minds.

00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:26.144
We don't claim to have the answers,

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.144
but we started experimenting
with different discussions
