Or reward people for reading

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.566
and responding to views
that they disagree with?

00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:18.795
And also, make it socially acceptable
that we change our minds,

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.511
or probably even reward that?

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:25.492
What if we have a matrix that says
how many people changed their minds,

00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:28.672
and that becomes part
of our social media experience?

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:32.283
If I could track how many people
are changing their minds,
