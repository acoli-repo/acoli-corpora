00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:31.775
It was a moment of defeat.

00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.905
I stayed silent for more than two years,

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.831
and I used the time to reflect
on everything that happened,

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:41.881
trying to understand why did it happen.

00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:44.218
It became clear to me

00:07:44.242 --> 00:07:49.163
that while it's true that polarization
is primarily driven

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:51.022
by our human behavior,

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:55.490
social media shapes this behavior
and magnifies its impact.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.406
Say you want to say something
that is not based on a fact,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.142
pick a fight or ignore
someone that you don't like.
