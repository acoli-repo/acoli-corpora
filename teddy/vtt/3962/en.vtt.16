pick a fight or ignore
someone that you don't like.

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:05.621
These are all natural human impulses,

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:07.800
but because of technology,

00:08:07.824 --> 00:08:11.248
acting on these impulses
is only one click away.

00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:15.505
In my view, there are five
critical challenges

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.847
facing today's social media.

00:08:18.794 --> 00:08:21.892
First, we don't know
how to deal with rumors.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:25.219
Rumors that confirm people's biases

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:29.320
are now believed and spread
among millions of people.
