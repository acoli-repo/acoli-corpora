00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.651
The longest journey
that I have ever taken.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.314
That was in 2002.

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:08.298
I was only 19 years old.

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:12.475
It was the first time
I had ever been on an airplane

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.304
and the first time
that I had left my country,

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.478
Rwanda.

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:20.614
I had to move thousands of kilometers away

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:21.918
to follow a dream.

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:25.274
A dream I have had
ever since I was a child.

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:29.862
And that dream was to become an architect.
