00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:32.696
Fast-forward to 2010,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.848
when I went back home to Rwanda.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.572
There, I found development patterns
similar to what I saw in China.

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:46.059
The country was and still is experiencing
its own population and economic growth.

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:49.749
The pressure to build cities,
infrastructure and buildings

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:51.669
is at its peak,

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:52.915
and as a result,

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.343
there is a massive building boom as well.

00:01:56.392 --> 00:02:01.266
This is the reality across
the entire continent of Africa,
