300 more examples will not be enough.

00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:37.556
We need a whole community
of African architects and designers

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.503
to lead with thousands more examples.

00:07:41.182 --> 00:07:43.024
In May of this year,

00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:46.619
we convened a symposium
on African architecture, in Kigali,

00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:50.341
and we invited many
of the leading African designers

00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:53.984
and architectural educators
working across the continent.

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:56.666
We all had one thing in common.

00:07:58.398 --> 00:08:02.565
Every single one of us
went to school abroad
