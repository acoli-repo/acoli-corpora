00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.403
25 schools

00:03:01.427 --> 00:03:06.129
and nearly 60,000 housing units each day,

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.443
every day.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.911
How are we going to build all of this?

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:18.055
Are we going to follow a model
of unsustainable building and construction

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.295
similar to what I witnessed in China?

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.352
Or can we develop a uniquely African model

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.448
of sustainable and equitable development?

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:29.594
I'm optimistic we can.

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:32.560
I know Africans who are already doing it.
