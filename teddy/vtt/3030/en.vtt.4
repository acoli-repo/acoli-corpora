00:01:56.392 --> 00:02:01.266
This is the reality across
the entire continent of Africa,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.440
and here's why.

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:06.021
By 2050, Africa's population will double,

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:09.532
reaching 2.5 billion people.

00:02:10.323 --> 00:02:11.935
At this point,

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.990
the African population will be
slightly less than the current population

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:21.156
of China and India combined.

00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:27.932
The infrastructure and buildings needed
to accommodate this many people

00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:31.491
is unprecedented
in the history of humankind.
