I know Africans who are already doing it.

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:36.374
Take Nigerian architect
Kunlé Adeyemi for instance,

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:39.635
and his work in slums
of coastal megacities.

00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.042
Places like Makoko in Lagos,

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:47.827
where hundreds of thousands of people
live in makeshift structures on stilts

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:49.028
on water,

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:51.459
without government
infrastructure or services.

00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:57.842
A community at great risk
of rising sea levels and climate change.

00:03:58.223 --> 00:04:02.576
And yet, people who live here
are examples of great ingenuity
