00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.395
World-class projects were built
to convey a new image of development.

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.579
Modern, striking engineering marvels
were going up literally everywhere.

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:13.188
But behind these facades,

00:01:13.212 --> 00:01:17.434
exploitation of huge numbers
of migrant workers,

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.615
massive displacement
of thousands of people

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.662
made these projects possible.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.968
And this fast-paced development

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:27.979
also contributed significantly
to the pollution

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:29.639
that is haunting China today.
