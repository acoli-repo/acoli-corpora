At the same time, they form a community

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:34.715
with other expectant mothers
and their families.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.485
The design of the of Kasungu
Maternity Waiting Village

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.613
borrows from the vernacular
typologies of Malawi villages

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:47.840
and is built using really simple
materials and techniques.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.015
The earth blocks that we used
were made from the same soil of this site.

00:06:53.803 --> 00:06:57.096
This reduces the carbon footprint
of this building,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.191
but first and foremost,

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:04.842
it provides a safe and dignified space
for these expectant mothers.
