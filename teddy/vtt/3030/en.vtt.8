00:03:58.223 --> 00:04:02.576
And yet, people who live here
are examples of great ingenuity

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.621
and the will to survive.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:07.720
Kunlé and his team have designed
a prototype school

00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:10.713
that is resilient to rising sea levels.

00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:12.989
This is Makoko School.

00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.707
It's a floating prototype structure
that can be adapted to clinics,

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.480
to housing, to markets

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:24.052
and other vital infrastructure
this community needs.

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:26.116
It's an ingenious solution

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.894
that can ensure this community
lives safely on the waters of Lagos.
