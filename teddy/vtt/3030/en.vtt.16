00:07:58.398 --> 00:08:02.565
Every single one of us
went to school abroad

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:04.470
and outside of Africa.

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:06.081
This has to change.

00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.628
If we are to develop
solutions unique to us,

00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:14.128
rather than attempting to turn
Kigali into Beijing,

00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:16.637
or Lagos into Shenzhen,

00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.415
we need a community

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:21.764
that will build the design confidence
of the next generation

00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:24.166
of African architects and designers.
