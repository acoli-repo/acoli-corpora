00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.865
That was impossible
at the time in my country.

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.720
There were no schools of architecture.

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:39.487
So when I got a scholarship
to study in China,

00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.217
I left my life and my family behind

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.082
and I moved to Shanghai.

00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:46.741
It was an amazing time.

00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:51.579
This country was going through
a major building boom.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:53.386
Shanghai, my new home,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.952
was quickly turning
into a skyscraper city.

00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.935
China was changing.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.395
World-class projects were built
to convey a new image of development.
