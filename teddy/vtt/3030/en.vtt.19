They immersed themselves in the community
to understand the challenges

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:35.063
but also uncover opportunities,

00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:39.219
like using a wall
made of local volcanic stone

00:09:39.243 --> 00:09:43.320
to turn the entire campus
into a space of play and active learning.

00:09:44.644 --> 00:09:47.490
They evaluated
the environmental conditions

00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:50.768
and developed a roof system
that maximizes daylight

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:52.850
and improves acoustic performance.

00:09:53.243 --> 00:09:57.433
The construction at Ruhehe Primary School
will begin this year.
