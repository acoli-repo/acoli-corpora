00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:30.720
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.637
to watch the 49ers game with his father

00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:34.670
on January 19.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.614
He never made it there.

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:39.661
I called Petaluma police

00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:42.157
and reported him missing that evening.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.059
The next morning,

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:47.782
two officers came to my home

00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:52.286
and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:54.750
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.002
at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.

00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:01.622
Thanks so much
