I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.840
and I received an email from a lady

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.325
that I'd like to read you her letter.

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:47.437
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:49.250
and she wrote this me this email

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.620
just a couple of days ago,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.620
and it's with her permission and blessing

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.645
that I read this to you.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:07:01.647
