Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:35.631
being one of the most utilized sites in the world.

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.761
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.084
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
in charge of building the bridge,

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.688
was quoted as saying,

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:48.084
"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.793
Suicide from the bridge

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:53.559
is neither practical nor probable."

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.853
But since its opening,

00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:59.000
over 1,600 people have leapt to their death

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.162
from that bridge.
