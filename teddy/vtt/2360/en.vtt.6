00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.340
train new officers.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.549
This is Jason Garber.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.760
I met Jason on July 22 of last year

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.875
when I get received a call

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.817
of a possible suicidal subject

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:11.566
sitting on the cord near midspan.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.263
I responded, and when I arrived,

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:16.077
I observed Jason

00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:19.448
speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:21.972
Jason was just 32 years old

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:24.804
and had flown out here from New Jersey.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.348
As a matter of fact,

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:28.166
he had flown out here on two other occasions

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.928
from New Jersey

00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:33.342
to attempt suicide on this bridge.
