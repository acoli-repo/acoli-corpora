00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.030
that we were successful that day

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.954
in getting her back over the rail.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.346
When I first began working on the bridge,

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:39.830
we had no formal training.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.624
You struggled to funnel your
way through these calls.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.078
This was not only a disservice

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:48.127
to those contemplating suicide,

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.920
but to the officers as well.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.100
We've come a long, long way since then.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.669
Now, veteran officers and psychologists

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.340
train new officers.
