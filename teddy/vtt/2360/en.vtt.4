00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:01.176
This is the cord.

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:03.233
Except for around the two towers,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.521
there is 32 inches of steel

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.051
paralleling the bridge.

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.336
This is where most folks stand

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:11.870
before taking their lives.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.904
I can tell you from experience

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.638
that once the person is on that cord,

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.396
and at their darkest time,

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:21.690
it is very difficult to bring them back.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.732
I took this photo last year

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:25.668
as this young woman spoke to an officer

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:27.666
contemplating her life.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.922
I want to tell you very happily

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.030
that we were successful that day
