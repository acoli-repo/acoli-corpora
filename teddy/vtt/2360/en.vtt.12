Confronting the person head-on

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:04.702
may just save their life and
be the turning point for them.

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:07.151
Some other signs to look for:

00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:11.299
hopelessness, believing that things are terrible

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.426
and never going to get better;

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:17.871
helplessness, believing that there is nothing

00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.303
that you can do about it;

00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:22.900
recent social withdrawal;

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.717
and a loss of interest in life.

00:06:27.717 --> 00:06:31.639
