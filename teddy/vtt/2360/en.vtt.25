00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.374
for about an hour.

00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:33.790
During that time, he shook my hand

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.527
on three occasions.

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.603
On that final handshake,

00:12:38.603 --> 00:12:40.937
he looked at me, and he said,

00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:46.340
"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.473
And he leapt.

00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:51.279
Horrible, absolutely horrible.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.255
I do want to tell you, though,

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:55.607
the vast majority of folks

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:59.129
that we do get to contact on that bridge

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:02.325
do not commit suicide.
