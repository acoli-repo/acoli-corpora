00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:01.744
I recently retired

00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:03.788
from the California Highway Patrol

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.725
after 23 years of service.

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.691
The majority of those 23 years

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.319
was spent patrolling the southern end

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:12.852
of Marin County,

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:16.029
which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.316
The bridge is an iconic structure,

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:19.569
known worldwide

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.245
for its beautiful views of San Francisco,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.636
the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:31.052
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,
