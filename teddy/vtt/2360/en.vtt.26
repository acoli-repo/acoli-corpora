00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:02.325
do not commit suicide.

00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:05.315
Additionally, that very few

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:07.971
who have jumped off the bridge and lived

00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:09.317
and can talk about it,

00:13:09.317 --> 00:13:12.130
that one to two percent,

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.961
most of those folks have said

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.315
that the second that they let go of that rail,

00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:19.880
they knew that they had made a mistake

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.931
and they wanted to live.

00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:27.364
I tell people, the bridge not only connects

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:29.645
Marin to San Francisco,

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:32.837
but people together also.
