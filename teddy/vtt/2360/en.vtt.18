00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.334
On March 11 of 2005,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.997
I responded to a radio call of a possible

00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:07.211
suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:08.699
near the north tower.

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.387
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk

00:09:11.387 --> 00:09:14.099

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:16.635
standing on the sidewalk.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:20.060
When he saw me, he immediately traversed

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.237
that pedestrian rail,

00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:23.109
and stood on that small pipe

00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:26.181
which goes around the tower.

00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:28.515
For the next hour and a half,

00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:31.443
I listened as Kevin spoke about
