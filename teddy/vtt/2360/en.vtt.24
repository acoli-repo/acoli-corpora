00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:02.451
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:

00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:08.109
sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.

00:12:08.109 --> 00:12:10.829
In my career, I've responded to

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:13.182
and been involved in hundreds

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:15.960
of mental illness and suicide calls

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.754
around the bridge.

00:12:17.754 --> 00:12:21.265
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:23.237
I've only lost two,

00:12:23.237 --> 00:12:25.423
but that's two too many.

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:27.435
One was Jason.

00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:29.691
The other was a man I spoke to

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.374
for about an hour.
