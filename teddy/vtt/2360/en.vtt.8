00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.194
Out flew plagues, sorrows,

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:03.406
and all sorts of evils against man.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:07.985
The only good thing in the box was hope.

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:10.558
Jason then asked us,

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.542
"What happens when you open the box

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:16.724
and hope isn't there?"

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:19.774
He paused a few moments,

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.213
leaned to his right,

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.414
and was gone.

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.284
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.064
had just committed suicide.
