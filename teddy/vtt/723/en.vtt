00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, I was in the hospital for a long time.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And a few years after I left, I went back,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
said, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And he explained to me that, when I shave,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but on the right side of my face

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I was badly burned so I have no hair,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this creates lack of symmetry.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what's the brilliant idea he had?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He was going to tattoo little black dots
