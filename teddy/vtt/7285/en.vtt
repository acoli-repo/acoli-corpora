In 1565, a man named Richard Walweyn
was arrested in London

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.464
for wearing what the authorities described

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:12.091
as a “very monstrous

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:17.096
and great outrageous pair of trunk hose.”

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.139
(Laughter)

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.642
For those of you who don't already have
a pair of these in your closet,

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.644
trunk hose are these puffy trousers,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:28.316
and they were all the rage
in men's fashion in Renaissance England.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.985
But they could get you into trouble.
