00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.376
When we say math is painful,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.640
there's some truth to it for some people.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.856
But where does this
math anxiety come from?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.536
It turns out that math
anxiety is contagious.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.976
When adults are worried about math,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.440
the children around them
start worrying, too.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.336
As young as first grade,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.856
when kids are in classrooms

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.416
with teachers who are anxious
about their own math ability,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.040
these kids learn less
across the school year.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.680
And it turns out that this
is more prevalent in girls than boys.
