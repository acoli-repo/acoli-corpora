In dance, the great choreographer,
George Balanchine,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.496
used to urge his dancers,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.880
"Don't think, just do."

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.296
When the pressure's on,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.856
when we want to put our best foot forward,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.096
somewhat ironically,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.960
we often try and control what we're doing
in a way that leads to worse performance.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.656
So what do we do?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.336
Knowing that we have
this overactive attention,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.800
how do we ensure
that we perform at our best?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.216
A lot of it comes down
to the prefrontal cortex,
