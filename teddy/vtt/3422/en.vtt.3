00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.176
The next shot that came I bobbled,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.320
but thankfully it didn't land in the goal.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.696
The shot after that,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.496
I wasn't so lucky:

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.800
I tipped it right into the net.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.016
My team lost;

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.200
the national coach walked away.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.000
I choked under the pressure
of those evaluative eyes on me.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.576
Just about everyone
does it from time to time --

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.056
there are so many opportunities,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.096
whether it's taking a test,
