It turns out that when parents are worried
about their own math ability

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.936
and they help their kids a lot

or a three-glass night."

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.040
and it affects whether
they choke or thrive.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.216
But just as we can put limits on others,
