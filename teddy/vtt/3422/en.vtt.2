00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.360
That's when everything changed.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.176
In a matter of seconds,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.016
I went from playing at the top
to the bottom of my ability.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.376
Just knowing that I was being evaluated
changed my performance

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.000
and forever how I thought about
the mental aspect of how we perform.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.096
All of a sudden the ball
seemed to go in slow motion,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.360
and I was fixated on my every move.
