00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.896
I thought I was ready to go --

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.120
I bombed it.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.880
I literally got the worst grade
in a class of 400 students.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.296
I was convinced I wasn't going
to be a science major,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.749
that maybe I was dropping
out of college altogether.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.560
But then I changed how I studied.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.376
Instead of studying alone,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.656
I started studying with a group of friends

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.976
who at the end of the study session
would close their book

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.960
and compete for the right answer.
