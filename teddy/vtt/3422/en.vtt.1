00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.200
but you also get the grief
when you land a shot in the goal.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.296
When you're a goalie,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.936
all eyes are on you,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.000
and with that comes the pressure.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.256
I distinctly remember
one game in high school.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.536
I was playing for
the California state team

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.080
which is part of the Olympic
Development Program.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.176
I was having a great game ...

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.280
until I realized that the national coach
was standing right behind me.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.360
That's when everything changed.
