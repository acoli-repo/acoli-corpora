00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.056
Why do we sometimes fail
to perform up to what we're capable of

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.440
when the pressure is on?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.736
It may not be so surprising to hear
that in stressful situations, we worry.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.976
We worry about the situation,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.496
the consequences,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.936
what others will think of us.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.376
But what is surprising
is that we often get in our own way

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.936
precisely because our worries
prompt us to concentrate too much.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.176
That's right --

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.280
we pay too much attention
to what we're doing.
