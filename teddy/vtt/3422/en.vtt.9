We as humans only have the ability
to pay attention to so much at once,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.696
which is why, by the way,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.400
it's not a good idea
to drive and talk on the cell phone.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.536
And under pressure,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.056
when we're concerned
about performing at our best,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.696
we can try and control
aspects of what we're doing

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.840
that should be left
outside conscious control.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.000
The end result is that we mess up.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.016
My research team and I have studied
this phenomenon of overattention,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.880
and we call it paralysis by analysis.
