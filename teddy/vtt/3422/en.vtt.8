00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.280
we pay too much attention
to what we're doing.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.576
When we're concerned
about performing our best,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.296
we often try and control
aspects of what we're doing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.696
that are best left on autopilot,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.856
outside conscious awareness,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.496
and as a result,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.720
we mess up.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.536
Think about a situation
where you're shuffling down the stairs.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.216
What would happen if I asked you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.456
to think about what
you're doing with your knee

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.736
while you're doing that?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.920
There's a good chance
you'd fall on your face.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.416
We as humans only have the ability
to pay attention to so much at once,
