00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.096
whether it's taking a test,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.656
giving a talk,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.576
pitching to a client

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.576
or that special form of torture
I like to call the job interview.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.096
(Laughter)

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.976
But the question is why.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.160
Why do we sometimes fail to perform
up to our potential under pressure?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.256
It's especially bewildering
in the case of athletes

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.600
who spend so much time
physically honing their craft.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.640
But what about their minds?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.136
Not as much.
