00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.696
Our parents, our teachers,
our coaches, our bosses all influence

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.680
whether or not we can put our best
foot forward when it matters most.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.120
Take math as an example.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.736
That's right, I said it:

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.176
math.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.896
Lots of people profess to choke
or are anxious about doing math,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.016
whether it's taking a test or even
calculating the tip on a dinner bill

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.320
as our smart friends look on.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.016
And it's quite socially acceptable

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.616
to talk about choking
or performing poorly in math.
