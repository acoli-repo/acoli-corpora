00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.880
and we call it paralysis by analysis.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.056
In one study, we asked college
soccer players to dribble a soccer ball

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.496
and to pay attention
to an aspect of their performance

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.080
that they would not otherwise attend to.

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:14.136
We asked them to pay attention

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.080
to what side of the foot

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.136
We showed that performance
was slower and more error-prone

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.696
when we drew their attention
to the step-by-step details

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.960
of what they were doing.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.056
When the pressure is on,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.216
we're often concerned
with performing at our best,
