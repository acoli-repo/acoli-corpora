00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.136
Not as much.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.096
This is true off
the playing field as well.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.576
Whether we're taking a test
of giving a talk,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.456
it's easy to feel like we're ready --

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.136
at the top of our game --

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760
and then perform at our worst
when it matters most.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.376
It turns out that rarely do we practice

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.216
under the types of conditions
we're actually going to perform under,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.496
and as a result,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.616
when all eyes are on us,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.520
we sometimes flub our performance.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.536
Of course, the question is,
why is this the case?
