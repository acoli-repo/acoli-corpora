But just as we can put limits on others,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.176
we can take them off.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.856
My research team and I have shown

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.096
that when we help parents
do fun math activities with their kids --

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.256
rather than, say, just doing
bedtime stories or bedtime reading,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.256
they do bedtime math,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.360
which are fun story problems
to do with your kids at night,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.336
not only do children's attitudes
about math improve,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.280
but their math performance
across the school year improves as well.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.080
Our environment matters.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.976
From the classroom to parents to media,
