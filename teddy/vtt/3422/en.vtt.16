Researchers have shown that simply
jotting down your thoughts and worries

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.496
before a stressful event

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.136
can help to download them from mind --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.280
make them less likely
to pop up in the moment.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.696
It's kind of like when you wake up
in the middle of the night

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.816
and you're really worried
about what you have to do the next day,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.816
you're trying to think about
everything you have to accomplish,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.496
and you write it down
and then you can go back to sleep.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.056
Journaling, or getting
those thoughts down on paper,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.056
makes it less likely they'll pop up
and distract you in the moment.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.000
The end result is that you can
perform your best when it matters most.
