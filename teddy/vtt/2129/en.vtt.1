00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:31.277
for their window displays.

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:32.672
This one's called "The Chase."

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:34.018
There are two pairs of shoes,

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:35.643
a man's pair and a woman's pair,

00:00:35.643 --> 00:00:38.547
and they play out this slow, tense chase

00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:39.825
around the window

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.050
in which the man scoots up behind the woman

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.623
and gets in her personal space,

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.558
and then she moves away.

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:47.399
Each of the shoes has magnets in it,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.402
and there are magnets underneath the table

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.366
that move the shoes around.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.398
My friend Andy Cavatorta was building

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.940
a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.332
and I wound up building the electronics

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:01.521
and motion control software
