00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:00.476
One example of those is protein folding.

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:01.888
So here we have an interface

00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:05.402
where we have physical handles onto a protein,

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:07.153
and we can grab those handles

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:10.140
and try to move the protein and
try to fold it in different ways.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.140
And if we move it in a way that
doesn't really make sense

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.107
with the underlying molecular simulation,

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.309
we get this physical feedback where we can

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.282
actually feel these physical handles

00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:20.890
pulling back against us.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.421
So feeling what's going on

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.660
inside a molecular simulation

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.606
is a whole different level of interaction.

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.587
So we're just beginning to explore
