00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.153
for interacting with digital information.

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:31.995
So here's an example of what I mean.

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.917
This is a video editing application

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.403
where all of the controls

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.710
for manipulating the video are physical.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.292
So if we want to tweak the color,

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.644
we just enter the color mode,

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:41.940
and then we get three different dials

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.318
for tweaking the color,

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:45.279
or if we want to adjust the audio,

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.620
then we get two different dials
for that, these physical objects.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.466
So here the left and right channel stay in sync,

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.209
but if we want to, we can override that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.208
by grabbing both of them at the same time.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.136
So the idea is that we get the speed

00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:01.253
and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials
