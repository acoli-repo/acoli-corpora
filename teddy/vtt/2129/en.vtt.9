This is a video chat application.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.412
It's amazing how much emotion you can convey

00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:33.625
with just a few simple movements

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.050
of a physical object.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.102
With this interface, we open up
a huge array of possibilities

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:41.180
in between traditional board games

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.594
and arcade games,

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:45.141
where the physical possibilities of interaction

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:48.854
make so many different styles of play possible.

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:51.243
But one of the areas that I'm most excited

00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:53.057
about using this platform for

00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:55.600
is applying it to problems that are difficult

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.854
for computers or people to solve alone.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:00.476
One example of those is protein folding.
