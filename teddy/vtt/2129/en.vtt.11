WEBVTT

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.587
So we're just beginning to explore

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:33.098
what's possible when we use software

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.589
to control the movement

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.832
of objects in our environment.

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.736
Maybe this is the computer of the future.

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:41.352
There's no touchscreen.

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.383
There's no technology visible at all.

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:45.227
But when we want to have a video chat

00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:46.688
or play a game

00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.401
or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,

00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:51.674
the objects on the table come alive.

00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:53.026
Thank you.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.149
