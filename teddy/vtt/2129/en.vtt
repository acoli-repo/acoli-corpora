A computer is an incredibly powerful means

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:05.042
of creative expression,

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.613
but for the most part,

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.778
that expression is confined to the screens

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.196
of our laptops and mobile phones.

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:13.396
And I'd like to tell you a story about

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.352
bringing this power of the computer

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.722
to move things around and interact with us

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.635
off of the screen and into the physical world

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:21.824
in which we live.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.442
A few years ago, I got a call from

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.928
a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.192
and the next thing I knew,

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:29.885
I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:31.277
for their window displays.
