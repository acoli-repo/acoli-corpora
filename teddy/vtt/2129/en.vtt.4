would help people use an interface more easily.

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.490
I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
to think about and interact with tangible objects.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.821
Think about which you find easier to use,

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:13.140
a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.240
like on a phone?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.265
But the thing that struck me

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:18.264
about all of these different projects

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:21.381
is that they really had to be built from scratch,

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.171
down to the level of the electronics

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.277
and the printed circuit boards and

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.022
all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.784
I wanted to create something

00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:32.103
where we could move objects
under computer control
