00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:32.103
where we could move objects
under computer control

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:34.352
and create interactions around that idea

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:36.567
without having to go through this process

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.950
of building something from scratch

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.325
every single time.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.316
So my first attempt at this

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.000
was at the MIT Media Lab

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.581
with Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.416
and we built this array of

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.673
512 different electromagnets,

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:51.300
and together they were able to move objects around

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.836
on top of their surface.

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.384
But the problem with this

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:56.040
was that these magnets

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200
cost over 10,000 dollars.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.866
Although each one was pretty small,

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.575
altogether they weighed so much
