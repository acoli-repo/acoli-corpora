00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.575
altogether they weighed so much

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:02.830
that the table that they were on

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.388
started to sag.

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:05.720
So I wanted to build something

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.336
where you could have this kind of interaction

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.979
on any tabletop surface.

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.060
So to explore this idea,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210
I built an army of small robots,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.975
and each of these robots has
what are called omni wheels.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.280
They're these special wheels

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.946
that can move equally easily in all directions,

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.535
and when you couple these robots

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:25.445
with a video projector,

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:27.253
you have these physical tools

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.153
for interacting with digital information.
