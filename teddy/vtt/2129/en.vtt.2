00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:01.521
and motion control software

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.987
to make the harps move and play music.

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:05.998
The harp has four separate pendulums,

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.124
and each pendulum has 11 strings,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.612
so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.815
in order to play different musical notes,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.977
and the harps are all networked together

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:16.777
so that they can play the right notes

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.403
at the right time in the music.

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:21.827
I built an interactive chemistry exhibit

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.426
at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:27.407
and this exhibit lets people use physical objects

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:30.443
to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table
