00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:30.443
to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:31.851
and bring them together to cause

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:33.617
chemical reactions to happen.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.541
And the museum noticed that people

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.767
were spending a lot of time with this exhibit,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.914
and a researcher from a science education center

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:43.719
in Australia decided to study this exhibit

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.959
and try to figure out what was going on.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.252
And she found that the physical objects

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:49.916
that people were using were helping people

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.930
understand how to use the exhibit,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.873
and were helping people learn in a social way.

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.139
And when you think about
it, this makes a lot of sense,

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.379
that using specialized physical objects

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.651
would help people use an interface more easily.
