00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:01.253
and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:04.043
together with the flexibility and versatility

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.374
of a system that's designed in software.

00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:09.309
And this is a mapping application

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.436
for disaster response.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:13.381
So you have these physical objects

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.608
that represent police, fire and rescue,

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:17.161
and a dispatcher can grab them

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:18.487
and place them on the map

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:20.476
to tell those units where to go,

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.852
and then the position of the units on the map

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.821
gets synced up with the position

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.448
of those units in the real world.

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:30.060
This is a video chat application.
