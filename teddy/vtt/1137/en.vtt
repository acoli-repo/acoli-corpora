00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was born in Switzerland

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and raised in Ghana, West Africa.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Ghana felt safe to me as a child.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was free, I was happy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The early 70s

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But then by the end of the decade,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the country had fallen back into political instability

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and mismanagement.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In 1979,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I witnessed my first military coup.
