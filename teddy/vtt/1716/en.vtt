00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.059
So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.068
and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:08.621
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable

00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.890
as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.413
at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.959
of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.148
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.332
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:28.381
"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.115
just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"
