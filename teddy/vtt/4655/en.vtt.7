Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia.

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:34.286
This is why both parties pay attention to these states.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:38.135
However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.351
such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire,

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.651
and even geographically large states with small populations

00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.183
like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas.

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:51.701
That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states,

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.901
because in a close election, every electoral vote counts.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.751
There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:00.701
These are known as "safe states."
