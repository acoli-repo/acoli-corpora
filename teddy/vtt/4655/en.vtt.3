If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.318
If your candidate loses, they get none.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:54.267
This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.550
