Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.601
Think of it this way.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:10.135
It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote --

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:18.454
in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states:

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:25.267
California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:31.001
Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia.
