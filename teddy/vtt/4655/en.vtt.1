00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.267
who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.768
To understand how this process began and how it continues today,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:42.587
we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution.

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:46.100
It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.051
Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.101
How do they decide on the number 538?

00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.850
Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.336
435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia.
