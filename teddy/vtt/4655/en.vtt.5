00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:30.336
This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins,

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:33.701
winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes,

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:38.617
but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states.

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:43.969
If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.817
would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally.

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:53.317
Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters,

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:57.169
but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:04.085
Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes.
