00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.776
I do want to test this question
we're all interested in:

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.816
Does extinction have to be forever?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.536
I'm focused on two projects
I want to tell you about.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.376
One is the Thylacine Project.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.162
The other one is the Lazarus Project,

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:15.896
and that's focused
on the gastric-brooding frog.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.816
And it would be a fair question to ask,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.096
why have we focused on these two animals?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.496
Well, point number one, each of them
represents a unique family of its own.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.096
We've lost a whole family.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.736
That's a big chunk
of the global genome gone.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.336
I'd like it back.
