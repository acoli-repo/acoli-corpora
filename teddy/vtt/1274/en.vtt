Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My talk essentially got written

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by three historic events

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that happened within days of each other

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the last two months --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
actually all having to do with

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000

The first one was actually a funeral --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Frombork, Poland

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
of the 16th-century astronomer
