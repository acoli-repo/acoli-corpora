00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:03.381
This one's personal.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.596
I know what it's like
to have the government say,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.739
"We're going to kill you in the morning."

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.885
I know what it's like
to leave a country on six hours' notice

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.757
and land on someone's couch.

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:19.282
Because of that, I wrote a book

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.306
on why countries do well
and why they don't.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.269
Let me summarize 250 pages.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.524
Countries have to be compassionate,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:28.698
they have to be kind,

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:31.198
they have to be smart,
they have to be brave.
