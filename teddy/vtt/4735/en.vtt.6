00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.461
but you can't move through space.

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:03.011
There's nothing to move through.

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:05.598
It's like trying to say how much a hole weighs.

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:08.089
A hole weighs exactly nothing

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.005
because a hole is nothing.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.546
It's a void, and so is space.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.724
To move relative to nothing is meaningless.

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.340
The concepts of speed and of rest

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.963
have only relative meaning.

00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:21.856
They are absolutely meaningless.

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:23.512
They mean something

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:25.444
only with respect to arbitrarily chosen,

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.190
artificial frames of reference.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.653
If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship,
