00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:03.341
the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth.

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.469
On their way to the Moon,

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.424
Apollo astronauts had a hard time

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.592
answering the question,

00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:09.641
"How fast are you moving?"

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.841
Speed away from Earth was one thing,

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.506
and speed toward the Moon was quite another.

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.007
That's because the Earth and the Moon

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.065
move relative to one another.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.474
Ah, of course!

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:21.687
Speed is a relative quantity.

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:24.683
When Captain Kirk ask Lieutenant Sulu

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.839
if the Starship Enterprise has reached a speed of warp 7,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.409
Sulu should reply, 


00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.245
"Relative to what, Captain?"
