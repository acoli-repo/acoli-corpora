00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.287
So, some motions are relative, and some are not.

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:02.844
There is no deep reality about constant speed,

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.710
but changes in speed are deeply real,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.090
and so are rotations.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.254
We have to be thoughtful

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:09.755
in our analysis of everyday experience

00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:12.422
in order to identify what is deeply real.

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:14.645
Since we can be fooled by perceptions

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:16.006
as basic as speed,

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:18.589
maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.537
This is what inspired Einstein

00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:21.949
to his incredible insights

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.278
about the speed of light and forward time travel.

00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:25.979
Knowing how to identify

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.565
what is deeply real

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.191
is tough and important work.
