00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.443
when they are referred to a reference frame.

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:05.433
Presumably that reference frame is itself at rest.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.365
But then we have to ask again,

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.367
"At rest relative to what?"

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.119
Because even the concept of rest

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.036
has lost any hint of absolute meaning.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.840
Speed is relative, and rest is relative.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.395
Earth's speed is 19 miles/second relative to the Sun.

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.506
The Enterprise's speed is warp 7

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:26.469
relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.415
Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair.
