00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.415
Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:32.018
But depending on where you sit,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.922
it is hundreds of miles/hour relative to Earth's center.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.589
When we furrow a brow and ask,

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.813
"But how fast is Earth really moving?"

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:41.858
we imagine Spaceship Earth

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:43.483
plowing through the ocean of space

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:45.278
as it orbits the Sun.

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:46.859
But space is not an ocean.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.156
It has no substance as water does.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:51.451
Space is not a thing;

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.827
space is nothing.

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:55.329
Space is no thing.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.505
You can move between two points in space,

00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.208
say between Earth and Mars,

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.461
but you can't move through space.
