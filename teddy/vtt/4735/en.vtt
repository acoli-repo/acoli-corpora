00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:12.251
How fast are you moving right now?

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:13.833
That seems like an easy question.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.200
The first tempting answer is,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.868
"I'm not moving."

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:18.173
Upon further reflection,

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:21.033
you realize that maybe the Earth's motion counts.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.119
So, a second tempting answer is,

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.804
"19 miles/second around the Sun."

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:27.681
But then you recall learning that the Sun

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.519
moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy,
