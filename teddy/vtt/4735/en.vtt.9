00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.671
And no sensors can measure it.

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.738
You are really changing speed,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.721
and they are really are not.

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.306
There's something absolutely real

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:38.588
about changes in speed.

00:04:38.588 --> 00:04:40.589
The same goes for rotation.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.172
If your spaceship is spinning,

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.172
you can feel it,

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:44.730
and your ship's sensors can measure it.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.065
The space station outside

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:47.817
may seem to be going around you,

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.483
but it is you who feels queasy,

00:04:49.483 --> 00:04:51.361
not the folks in the space station.

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.949
You are really spinning,

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.556
and they really are not.

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:57.367
There's something absolutely real about rotation.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.287
So, some motions are relative, and some are not.
