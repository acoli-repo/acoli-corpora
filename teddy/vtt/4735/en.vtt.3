00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.245
"Relative to what, Captain?"

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.749
Such a sassy reply

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.124
may get subordinate Starfleet officers in trouble,

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:36.916
but it is the only good answer

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.380
to the question, "How fast are you moving?"

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.256
This is basic relatively talking.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.800
Not fancy Einsteinian relativity,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.141
but good old fashioned (and still correct)

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.226
Galilean relativity.

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:50.222
Galileo seems to have been the first person

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:52.006
to realize that there is no such thing

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.061
as an absolute speed.

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.311
Speeds are relative.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.467
This means that speeds only have meaning

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.443
when they are referred to a reference frame.
