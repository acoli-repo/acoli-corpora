00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.653
If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship,

00:03:30.653 --> 00:03:32.699
and you see from the side window, say,

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.655
a space station whizz by at constant speed,

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:38.543
there is no way to know which of you is really moving.

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:40.291
Neither of you is really moving

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.854
because there is no deep reality about constant speed.

00:03:42.854 --> 00:03:45.024
Constant speed in a straight line

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.922
has only relative meaning,

00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:49.175
a kind of relative reality.

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.595
Does this mean that all motion is relative?

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:54.765
No! Some motions have only relative meaning,

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:56.907
but some motions have absolute meaning,

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:59.019
are absolutely real.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.276
For example, constant speed is relative,
