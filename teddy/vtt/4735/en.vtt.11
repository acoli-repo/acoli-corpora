00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.191
is tough and important work.

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.322
If a police officer ever pulls you over for speeding

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.858
and asks, &amp;quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&amp;quot;

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:39.272
an insightful, though perhaps unwise, reply

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.775
would be, "Relative to what?"

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.499
And then, as you sit in the backseat of the police car

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.358
and feel it accelerate toward jail,

00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.194
you can add,

00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:52.194
&amp;quot;But some things are absolute!&amp;quot;
