WEBVTT

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.519
moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.982
and the Milky Way moves within the Local Group of galaxies,

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:36.814
and the Local Group moves within the Virgo Cluster,

00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:39.233
and the Virgo Cluster moves within...

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.569
"How fast are you moving?"

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.154
is not an easy question.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:43.864
When Mission Control tells astronauts

00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:45.240
how fast they're going,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.327
there's always an assumed standard of rest.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:49.413
At the start of the voyage,

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:51.782
speeds are given relative to the launchpad.

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:53.365
But later, when the launchpad is

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:54.866
just one more arbritrary place

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.921
down there on Earth's spinning surface,

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.618
speeds are given relative to

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:03.341
the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth.
