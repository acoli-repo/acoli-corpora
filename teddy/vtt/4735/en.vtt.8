00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.276
For example, constant speed is relative,

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.691
but change in speed is absolute.

00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.792
Calling something absolute in science

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.781
means that arbitrary standards are not used

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:10.947
in its measurement.

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.115
It is unambiguously measurable.

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:15.404
When your spaceship fires its engines,

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:18.402
your change in speed is beyond doubt.

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:19.872
You feel it in your stomach,

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:21.972
and your ship's sensors can measure it.

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.250
Outside your window,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.303
the passing space station

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.255
may seem to be changing speed,

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:29.005
but the beings inside the station will not feel it.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.671
And no sensors can measure it.
