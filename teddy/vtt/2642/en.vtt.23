00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.895
So what now happens in Haryana is,

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:35.539
all principals and teachers are divided
into hundreds of WhatsApp groups

00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:38.385
and anytime something needs
to be communicated,

00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:40.830
it's just posted across
all WhatsApp groups.

00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:43.687
It spreads like wildfire.

00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.704
You can immediately check
who has received it,

00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:48.018
who has read it.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:51.902
Teachers can ask clarification
questions instantaneously.

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:53.167
And what's interesting is,

00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:56.549
it's not just the headquarters
who are answering these questions.

00:11:56.573 --> 00:11:59.462
Another teacher from
a completely different part of the state

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:01.879
will stand up and answer the question.
