are choosing to pull their children
out of public schools

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.421
and pay out of their pockets
to put them in private schools.

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:39.110
As a comparison,
in a far richer country, the US,

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.055
that number is only 10 percent.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:46.330
That's a huge statement on how broken
the Indian public education system is.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.907
So it was with that background
that I got a call in the summer of 2013

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:55.754
from an absolutely brilliant lady
called Surina Rajan.

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:59.895
She was, at that time, the head
of the Department of School Education

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.185
in a state called Haryana in India.
