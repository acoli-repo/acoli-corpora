00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:03.746
But anyway, we jumped right in
and as we jumped in,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.509
all sorts of ideas started flying at us.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:09.571
People said, "Let's change
the way we recruit teachers,

00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:12.339
let's hire new principals and train them

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:14.581
and send them on international
learning tours,

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.104
let's put technology inside classrooms."

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:19.734
By the end of week one,
we had 50 ideas on the table,

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:21.986
all amazing, all sounded right.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.713
There was no way we were
going to be able to implement 50 things.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:28.853
So I said, "Hang on, stop.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.424
Let's first at least decide
what is it we're trying to achieve."
