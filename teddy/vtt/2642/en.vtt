So we all have our own biases.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.784
For example, some of us tend to think

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:09.417
that it's very difficult to transform
failing government systems.

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.618
When we think of government systems,

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.233
we tend to think that they're archaic,
set in their ways,

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:17.953
and perhaps, the leadership
is just too bureaucratic

00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:19.382
to be able to change things.

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.112
Well, today, I want
to challenge that theory.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:27.955
I want to tell you a story
of a very large government system

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.423
that has not only put itself
on the path of reform
