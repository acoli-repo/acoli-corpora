00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:33.762
as we delved into it deeper,
we found a few such core root causes

00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:37.918
which were determining, which were
shaping how people behaved in the system.

00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:41.625
And we realized that unless we change
those specific things,

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:43.602
we could do a number of other things.

00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:46.469
We could train, we could put
technology into schools,

00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.473
but the system wouldn't change.

00:06:48.497 --> 00:06:51.554
And addressing these non-obvious
core issues

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.387
became a key part of the program.

00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:57.630
So, we had the goal and we had the issues,

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.403
and now we needed to figure out
what the solutions were.
