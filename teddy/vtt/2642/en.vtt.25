00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:31.208
Once a quarter,
all students across the state

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:33.397
are assessed on their learning outcomes

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.279
and schools which are
doing well are rewarded.

00:12:36.303 --> 00:12:38.772
And schools which are not doing so well

00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:41.201
find themselves having
difficult conversations.

00:12:41.568 --> 00:12:43.647
Of course, they also get
additional support

00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:45.607
to be able to do better in the future.

00:12:47.232 --> 00:12:48.856
In the context of education,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.247
it's very difficult
to see results quickly.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.605
When people talk about systemic,
large-scale change,

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:58.208
they talk about periods
of 7 years and 10 years.

00:12:58.232 --> 00:12:59.497
But not in Haryana.
