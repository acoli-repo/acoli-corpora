00:13:00.153 --> 00:13:04.105
In the last one year, there have been
three independent studies,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:06.708
all measuring student learning outcomes,

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:09.039
which indicate that something fundamental,

00:13:09.063 --> 00:13:11.153
something unique is happening in Haryana.

00:13:11.622 --> 00:13:14.630
Learning levels of children
have stopped declining,

00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:16.457
and they have started going up.

00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:19.691
Haryana is one of the few
states in the country

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:21.294
which is showing an improvement,

00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:25.021
and certainly the one that is showing
the fastest rate of improvement.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.373
These are still early signs,

00:13:27.397 --> 00:13:28.591
there's a long way to go,

00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:31.106
but this gives us a lot of hope
for the future.
