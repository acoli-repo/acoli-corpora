00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:02.404
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.310
they cannot construct
a grammatically correct sentence.

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:09.042
These are things that you and I
would expect an 8-year-old

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.334
to be able to do.

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:13.469
By the time kids are 13 or 14,

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:15.273
they tend to drop out of schools.

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.587
In India, public schools
not only offer free education --

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.024
they offer free textbooks,
free workbooks, free meals,

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.118
sometimes even cash scholarships.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.676
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.880
are choosing to pull their children
out of public schools
