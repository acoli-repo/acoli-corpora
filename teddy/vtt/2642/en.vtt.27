00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:31.106
but this gives us a lot of hope
for the future.

00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:34.422
I recently went to a school,

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.389
and as I was leaving,

00:13:36.413 --> 00:13:37.564
I ran into a lady,

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:38.739
her name was Parvati,

00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:40.201
she was the mother of a child,

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.496
and she was smiling.

00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:44.737
And I said, "Why are you smiling,
what's going on?"

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:47.507
And she said, "I don't know
what's going on,

00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.618
but what I do know
is that my children are learning,

00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:52.093
they're having fun,

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:55.312
and for the time being, I'll stop
my search for a private school

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.499
to send them to."

00:13:57.523 --> 00:13:59.523
So I go back to where I started:

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.421
Can government systems transform?
