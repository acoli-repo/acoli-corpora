00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.009
I promised to help a state and system

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.356
which was as large as that of Peru
or Canada transform itself.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:40.168
As I started this project,
I was very painfully aware of two things.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.403
One, that I had never done
anything like this before.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:47.802
And two, many others had,
perhaps without too much success.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:51.009
As my colleagues and I
looked across the country

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.341
and across the world,

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:54.233
we couldn't find another example

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.083
that we could just pick up
and replicate in Haryana.

00:02:57.107 --> 00:02:59.607
We knew that we had to craft
our own journey.
