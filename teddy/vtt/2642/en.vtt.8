Does this idea support this goal?
If yes, let's keep it.

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:04.252
But if it doesn't or we're not sure,
then let's put it aside.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:08.900
As simple as it sounds,
having a very specific goal right up front

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:12.140
has really allowed us to be
very sharp and focused

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.792
in our transformation journey.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:16.434
And looking back over
the last two and a half years,

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:18.420
that has been a huge positive for us.

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:20.652
So we had the goal,

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:24.082
and now we needed to figure out
what are the issues, what is broken.

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.728
Before we went into schools,
a lot of people told us

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.818
that education quality is poor

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:33.716
because either the teachers are lazy,
they don't come into schools,
