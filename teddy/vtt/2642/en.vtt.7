00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.424
Let's first at least decide
what is it we're trying to achieve."

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:35.222
So with a lot of push and pull and debate,

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:39.133
Haryana set itself a goal
which said: by 2020,

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:43.144
we want 80 percent of our children
to be at grade-level knowledge.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.473
Now the specifics of the goal
don't matter here,

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.411
but what matters
is how specific the goal is.

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.758
Because it really allowed us
to take all those ideas

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.207
which were being thrown at us

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:56.605
and say which ones
we were going to implement.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.948
Does this idea support this goal?
If yes, let's keep it.
