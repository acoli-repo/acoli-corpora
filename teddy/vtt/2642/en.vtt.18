In the context of effective learning,

00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:03.362
one of the things people talk about
is hands-on learning.

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:05.654
Children shouldn't memorize
things from books,

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.267
they should do activities,

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.290
and that's a more effective way to learn.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.612
Which basically means
giving students things

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:15.058
like beads, learning rods, abacuses.

00:09:15.082 --> 00:09:17.536
But we did not have
the budgets to give that

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.175
to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.902
We needed another solution.

00:09:22.446 --> 00:09:23.992
We couldn't think of anything.

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:27.197
One day, one of our team members
went to a school

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:31.587
and saw a teacher pick up sticks
and stones from the garden outside
