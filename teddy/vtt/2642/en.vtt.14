00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.403
and now we needed to figure out
what the solutions were.

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.326
We obviously did not want
to recreate the wheel,

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.100
so we said, "Let's look around
and see what we can find."

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.387
And we found these beautiful,
small pilot experiments

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:13.582
all over the country
and all over the world.

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:18.114
Small things being done by NGOs,
being done by foundations.

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:22.095
But what was also interesting
was that none of them actually scaled.

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:25.657
All of them were limited
to 50, 100 or 500 schools.

00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.721
And here, we were looking
for a solution for 15,000 schools.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.884
So we looked into why,
