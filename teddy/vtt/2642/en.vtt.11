over the last two decades,

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.359
India had been fighting the challenge
of access, having enough schools,

00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:51.154

into the schools.

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:54.608

00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:56.491

00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:01.272
and the teachers became
the implicit executors of these programs.
