This was a milestone for science,

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:36.798
and we had no idea what we would find
in this brand-new data.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.168
And then a few weeks later,
we found a bump.

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:45.868
It wasn't a very big bump,

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.464
but it was big enough to make
you raise your eyebrow.

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:51.739
But on a scale of one to 10
for eyebrow raises,

00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:54.373
if 10 indicates that you've
discovered a new particle,

00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:56.124
this eyebrow raise is about a four.

00:04:56.148 --> 00:04:57.298
(Laughter)

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:03.643
I spent hours, days, weeks
in secret meetings,
