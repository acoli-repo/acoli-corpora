00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:31.570
and spits off two photons,

00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:33.616
two particles of light.

00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:38.327
And this hypothetical,
extra-dimensional graviton

00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:42.058
is one of the only possible,
hypothetical new particles

00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:44.217
that has the special quantum properties

00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:48.477
that could give birth to our little,
two-photon bump.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.820
So, the possibility of explaining
the mysteries of gravity

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:59.342
and of discovering extra
dimensions of space --

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:00.958
perhaps now you get a sense
