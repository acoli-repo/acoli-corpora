00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:03.071
But why not?

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.320
I mean, if I didn't discover
a particle -- and I didn't --

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:11.238
if I didn't discover a particle,
why am I here talking to you?

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:13.699
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame

00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:14.947
and go home?

00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:22.520
Particle physicists are explorers.

00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:26.373
And very much of what we do
is cartography.

00:12:27.468 --> 00:12:30.320
Let me put it this way: forget
about the LHC for a second.
