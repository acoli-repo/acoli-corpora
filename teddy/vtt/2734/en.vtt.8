00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.624
when we discovered the Higgs boson.

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:04.389
Many of my colleagues had been working
their entire careers for this moment,

00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:06.489
and frankly, to little curious me,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.423
this was the moment
I'd been waiting for my entire life.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:11.178
So 2015 was go time.

00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:14.864
So June 2015,

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.381
the LHC is switched back on.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.917
My colleagues and I held our breath
and bit our fingernails,

00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:24.452
and then finally we saw
the first proton collisions

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:26.432
at this highest energy ever.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.532
Applause, champagne, celebration.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:32.152
This was a milestone for science,
