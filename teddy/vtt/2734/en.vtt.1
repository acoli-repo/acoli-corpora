00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:30.621
planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.023
As a kid, I would puzzle
over questions just like this.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.939
I would fiddle around
with microscopes and electromagnets,

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.158
and I would read
about the forces of the small

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:40.516
and about quantum mechanics

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.104
and I would marvel at how well
that description matched up

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:45.298
to our observation.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.803
Then I would look at the stars,

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.351
and I would read about how well
we understand gravity,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.725
and I would think surely,
there must be some elegant way

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.394
that these two systems match up.

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:58.422
But there's not.

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:00.833
And the books would say,
