00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:02.810
And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.399
and the biggest, highest
energy collider in the world

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.889
is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:13.170
And then, we collide protons
quadrillions of times,

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:17.478
and we collect this data very slowly,
over months and months.

00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:23.148
And then new particles might show up
in our data as bumps --

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:25.617
slight deviations from what you expect,

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:29.608
little clusters of data points
that make a smooth line not so smooth.
