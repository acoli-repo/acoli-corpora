00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:32.648
But one of these options is huge,

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:35.508
and it has to do with
that long-standing question

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:38.054
that bothered me as a tiny little kid,

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:39.438
about gravity.

00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:44.618
Gravity may seem super strong to you,

00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:48.742
but it's actually crazily weak
compared to the other forces of nature.

00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:51.397
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.233
but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.

00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:59.679
The strength of gravity compared
to the other forces of nature?
