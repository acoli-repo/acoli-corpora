00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:00.833
And the books would say,

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:04.040
yeah, we understand a lot
about these two realms separately,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.674
but when we try to link
them mathematically,

00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:08.028
everything breaks.

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:09.984
And for 100 years,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:15.036
none of our ideas as to how to solve
this basically physics disaster,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.874
has ever been supported by evidence.

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.925
And to little old me --

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:21.759
little, curious, skeptical James --

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:24.651
this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.244
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:32.078
