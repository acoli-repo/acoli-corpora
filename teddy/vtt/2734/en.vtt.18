WEBVTT

00:08:57.364 --> 00:09:00.373
for an excitation
in a three-dimensional field;

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.317
a localized wobbling in space.

00:09:03.288 --> 00:09:06.817
More importantly, all the math
that we use to describe all this stuff

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.914
assumes that there are only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:13.319
But math is math, and we can play
around with our math however we want.

00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:16.509
And people have been playing around
with extra dimensions of space

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:17.688
for a very long time,

00:09:17.712 --> 00:09:20.297
but it's always been an abstract
mathematical concept.

00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:23.493
I mean, just look around you --
you at the back, look around --

00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:25.798
there's clearly only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.513
But what if that's not true?
