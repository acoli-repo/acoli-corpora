00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:00.215
to include an extra particle,
a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.234
a special graviton that lives
in extra-spatial dimensions.

00:10:03.258 --> 00:10:04.723
I see the looks on your faces.

00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:06.566
You should be asking me the question,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.234
"How in the world are we going to test
this crazy, science fiction idea,

00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:12.749
stuck as we are in three dimensions?"

00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:14.055
The way we always do,

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.218
by slamming together two protons --

00:10:16.242 --> 00:10:17.394
(Laughter)

00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:19.982
Hard enough that
the collision reverberates

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:22.697
into any extra-spatial dimensions
that might be there,

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.320
momentarily creating
this hyperdimensional graviton

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:29.724
that then snaps back
into the three dimensions of the LHC

00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:31.570
and spits off two photons,
