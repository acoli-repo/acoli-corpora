00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.889
Better than that,
my theorist colleagues --

00:06:02.548 --> 00:06:04.865
I love my theorist colleagues --

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.501
my theorist colleagues wrote
500 papers about this little bump.

00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:09.980
(Laughter)

00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:14.540
The world of particle physics
had been flipped on its head.

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:19.987
But what was it about this particular bump

00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:24.101
that caused thousands of physicists
to collectively lose their cool?

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.032
This little bump was unique.

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:29.567
This little bump indicated

00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.613
that we were seeing an unexpectedly
large number of collisions
