00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:31.191
Its design and construction
took decades of work

00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:34.247
by thousands of physicists
from around the globe,

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.812
and in the summer of 2015,

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:40.260
we had been working tirelessly
to switch on the LHC

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:44.751
at the highest energy that humans
have ever used in a collider experiment.

00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:48.258
Now, higher energy is important

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.469
because for particles,
there is an equivalence

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:52.694
between energy and particle mass,

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:55.179
and mass is just a number
put there by nature.

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:57.386
To discover new particles,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.532
we need to reach these bigger numbers.

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:02.810
And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,
