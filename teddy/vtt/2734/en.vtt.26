00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.456
But then what do we do?
Do we just give up and fly away?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.767
Absolutely not;

00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:05.096
we would be terrible scientists if we did.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.733
No, we spend the next couple
of decades exploring,

00:13:08.757 --> 00:13:10.237
mapping out the territory,

00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:12.626
sifting through the sand
with a fine instrument,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.108
peeking under every stone,

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:15.686
drilling under the surface.

00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:18.699
New particles can either
show up immediately

00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:20.856
as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.821
or they can only reveal themselves
after years of data taking.

00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:30.513
Humanity has just begun its exploration
at the LHC at this big high energy,
