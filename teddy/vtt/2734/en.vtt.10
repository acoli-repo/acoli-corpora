00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:03.643
I spent hours, days, weeks
in secret meetings,

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.027
arguing with my colleagues
over this little bump,

00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.287
poking and prodding it with our most
ruthless experimental sticks

00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.288
to see if it would withstand scrutiny.

00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:15.449
But even after months
of working feverishly --

00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:17.905
sleeping in our offices
and not going home,

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.006
candy bars for dinner,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.600
coffee by the bucketful --

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:25.867
physicists are machines
for turning coffee into diagrams --

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:27.290
(Laughter)

00:05:27.314 --> 00:05:29.850
This little bump would not go away.
