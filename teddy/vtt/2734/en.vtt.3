Flash-forward now
to December of 2015,

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.503
when I found myself smack in the middle

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:38.467
of the physics world
being flipped on its head.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.319
It all started when we at CERN
saw something intriguing in our data:

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:45.617
a hint of a new particle,

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:49.857
an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
answer to this question.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.904
So I'm still a skeptical
little kid, I think,

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:56.061
but I'm also now a particle hunter.

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.548
I am a physicist at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.043
the largest science
experiment ever mounted.
