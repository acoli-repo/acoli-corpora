00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.558
but imagine designing
a particle physics experiment

00:14:31.582 --> 00:14:33.251
using such sophisticated algorithms

00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:36.443
that it could teach itself to discover
a hyperdimensional graviton.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:37.624
But what if?

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:39.093
What if the ultimate question:

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:42.590
What if even artificial intelligence
can't help us answer our questions?

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:44.725
What if these open questions,
for centuries,

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:47.418
are destined to be unanswered
for the foreseeable future?

00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:50.371
What if the stuff that's bothered me
since I was a little kid

00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:52.918
is destined to be unanswered
in my lifetime?

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:55.551
Then that ...

00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.376
will be even more fascinating.
