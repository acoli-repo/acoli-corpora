00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:32.842
So after a few months,

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.576
we presented our little bump to the world
with a very clear message:

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:40.168
this little bump is interesting
but it's not definitive,

00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:43.521
so let's keep an eye on it
as we take more data.

00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:46.163
So we were trying to be
extremely cool about it.

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:49.651
And the world ran with it anyway.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.015
The news loved it.

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:55.290
People said it reminded
them of the little bump

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:58.737
that was shown on the way
toward the Higgs boson discovery.

00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.889
Better than that,
my theorist colleagues --
