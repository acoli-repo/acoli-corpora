00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:32.061
We feel a little bit of it,

00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:33.761
but where's the rest of it?

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:35.067
No one knows.

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:40.406
But one theoretical explanation
proposes a wild solution.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.459
You and I --

00:08:43.483 --> 00:08:45.061
even you in the back --

00:08:45.085 --> 00:08:47.230
we live in three dimensions of space.

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:49.811
I hope that's a
non-controversial statement.

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:51.664
(Laughter)

00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:55.126
All of the known particles also live
in three dimensions of space.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.340
In fact, a particle is just another name

00:08:57.364 --> 00:09:00.373
for an excitation
in a three-dimensional field;
