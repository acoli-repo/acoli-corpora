00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.613
that we were seeing an unexpectedly
large number of collisions

00:06:32.637 --> 00:06:35.968
whose debris consisted
of only two photons,

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:37.236
two particles of light.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.497
And that's rare.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.689
Particle collisions are not
like automobile collisions.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.232
They have different rules.

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:45.906
When two particles collide
at almost the speed of light,

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.351
the quantum world takes over.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.635
And in the quantum world,

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.852
these two particles
can briefly create a new particle

00:06:51.876 --> 00:06:54.656
that lives for a tiny fraction of a second

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.561
before splitting into other particles
that hit our detector.

00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.990
Imagine a car collision
where the two cars vanish upon impact,
