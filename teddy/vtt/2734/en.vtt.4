00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.043
the largest science
experiment ever mounted.

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:07.412
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel
on the border of France and Switzerland

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.286
buried 100 meters underground.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.464
And in this tunnel,

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:14.441
we use superconducting magnets
colder than outer space

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.526
to accelerate protons
to almost the speed of light

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.427
and slam them into each other
millions of times per second,

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.277
collecting the debris of these collisions

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:28.272
to search for new, undiscovered
fundamental particles.

00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:31.191
Its design and construction
took decades of work
