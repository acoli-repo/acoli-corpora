00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.990
Imagine a car collision
where the two cars vanish upon impact,

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:03.283
a bicycle appears in their place --

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:04.378
(Laughter)

00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:06.863
And then that bicycle explodes
into two skateboards,

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.068
which hit our detector.

00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:09.471
(Laughter)

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.448
Hopefully, not literally.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.814
They're very expensive.

00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:17.939
Events where only two photons
hit out detector are very rare.

00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:21.685
And because of the special
quantum properties of photons,

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:25.497
there's a very small number
of possible new particles --

00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.018
these mythical bicycles --

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.285
that can give birth to only two photons.

00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:32.648
But one of these options is huge,
