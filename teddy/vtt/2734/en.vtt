There is something about physics

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:09.296
that has been really bothering me
since I was a little kid.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.819
And it's related to a question

00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:16.087
that scientists have been asking
for almost 100 years,

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.280
with no answer.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:22.118
How do the smallest things in nature,

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:24.295
the particles of the quantum world,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.350
match up with the largest
things in nature --

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:30.621
planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?
