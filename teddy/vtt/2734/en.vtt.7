00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.100
For example, this bump,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.543
after months of data-taking in 2012,

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.696
led to the discovery
of the Higgs particle --

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.925
the Higgs boson --

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.314
and to a Nobel Prize
for the confirmation of its existence.

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:47.530
This jump up in energy in 2015

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:51.920
represented the best chance
that we as a species had ever had

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.421
of discovering new particles --

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:55.557
new answers to these
long-standing questions,

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:58.678
because it was almost
twice as much energy as we used

00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.624
when we discovered the Higgs boson.
