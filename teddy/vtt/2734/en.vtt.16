00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.670
It's 10 to the minus 39.

00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:05.231
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:06.412
Worse than that,

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:09.463
all of the other known forces of nature
are perfectly described

00:08:09.487 --> 00:08:11.524
by this thing we call the Standard Model,

00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:14.983
which is our current best description
of nature at its smallest scales,

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:16.163
and quite frankly,

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:20.364
one of the most successful
achievements of humankind --

00:08:20.388 --> 00:08:24.400
except for gravity, which is absent
from the Standard Model.

00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:25.574
It's crazy.

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:29.146
It's almost as though most
of gravity has gone missing.
