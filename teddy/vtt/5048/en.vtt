For millennia,

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.414
the people of Britain had been using 
bronze to make tools and jewelry,

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:15.060
and as a currency for trade.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.100
But around 800 BCE, that began to change:

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.120
the value of bronze declined, causing 
social upheaval and an economic crisisâ€”

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.766
what we would call a recession today.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.646
