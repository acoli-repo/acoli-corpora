00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.805
Openness. It's a word that

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:06.884
denotes opportunity and possibilities.

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:08.924
Open-ended, open hearth,

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:12.277
open source, open door policy,

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:15.813
open bar. (Laughter)

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:18.333
And everywhere the world is opening up,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.833
and it's a good thing.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:21.609
Why is this happening?

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.573
The technology revolution is opening the world.

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:27.118
Yesterday's Internet was a platform

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:29.710
for the presentation of content.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.965
The Internet of today is a platform for computation.
