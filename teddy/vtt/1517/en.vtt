So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
political cartoonist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a sort of paper-based reader.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Laughter)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's lighter than an iPad,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's a bit cheaper.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You know what they say?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They say the print media is dying --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
who says that? Well, the media.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But this is no news, right?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You've read about it already.
