This is Goliath, the krill.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.270
Don’t get too attached.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.330
Today this 1 centimeter crustacean

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.017
will share the same fate as 40 million
of his closest friends:

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.696
a life sentence in the belly 
of the largest blue whale in the world.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:25.636
Let’s call her Leviatha.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:29.968
Leviatha weighs 
something like 150 metric tons,

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.406
and she’s the largest animal in the world.
