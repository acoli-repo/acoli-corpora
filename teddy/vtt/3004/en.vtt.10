00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.040
(Repeating sound waves)

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.816
Pretty weird, right?

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.576
(Laughter)

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.056
So that sound is actually at the same
burst frequency as your brain waves

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.416
when your brain is in deep sleep.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.696
That sound pattern
actually primes your mind

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.360
to have more of these
regenerative delta waves.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.016
When we asked participants
the next day about the sounds,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.936
they were completely unaware
that we played the sounds,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.840
yet their brains responded
with more of these delta waves.
