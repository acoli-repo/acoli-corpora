The circadian rhythm dictates
our energy level throughout the day,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.336
and only recently we've been conducting
a global experiment on this rhythm,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.416
which is putting our sleep health

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.840
and ultimately
our life quality in jeopardy.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.496
Because of this,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.656
we aren't getting the sleep we need,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.416
with the average American
sleeping a whole hour less

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.936
than they did in the 1940s.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.216
For some reason,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.496
we decided to wear it as a badge of honor

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
that we can get by on not enough sleep.
