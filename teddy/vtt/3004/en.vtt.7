00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.536
I learned a lot, and I found
I really do need, like most people,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.216
eight hours of sleep.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.296
I even shifted my circadian component

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.016
by changing my meals,
exercise and light exposure,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.296
but I still couldn't find a way
to get a deeper night of sleep ...

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.376
that is until I met
Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.696
from Harvard Medical School.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.896
Dmitry told me about
a new finding in the literature,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.336
where a lab out of Germany showed
that if you could play certain sounds

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.896
at the right time in people's sleep,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.360
you could actually make sleep
deeper and more efficient.
