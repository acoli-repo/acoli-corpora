00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.736
Poor sleep makes us
make risky, rash decisions

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.720
and is a drain
on our capacity for empathy.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.136
When sleep deprivation literally makes us
more sensitive to our own pain,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.176
it's not so surprising that we have
a hard time relating to others

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.416
and just generally
being a good and healthy person

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
when we're sleep-deprived.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.296
Scientists are now starting to understand

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.496
how not only the quantity

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.320
but also the quality of sleep
impacts our health and well-being.
