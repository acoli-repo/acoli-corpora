00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.480
to develop this deep-sleep
stimulating technology.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.056
Here's how it works.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.336
People came into the lab

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.736
and we hooked them up
to a number of devices,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.536
two of which I have on right here --

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.816
not a fashion statement.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.360
(Laughter)

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.016
When we detected
that people were in deep sleep,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.696
we played the deep-sleep
stimulating sounds

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.376
that were shown
to make them have deeper sleep.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.680
I'm going to demo this sound
for you right now.
