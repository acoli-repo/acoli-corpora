00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.320
our brain waves are very similar
to our brain waves in waking life.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.816
But our brain waves in deep sleep
have these long-burst brain waves

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.976
that are very different
from our waking life brain waves.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.400
These long-burst brain waves
are called delta waves.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.056
When we don't get the deep sleep we need,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.256
it inhibits our ability to learn

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.080
and for our cells and bodies to recover.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.096
Deep sleep is how we convert
all those interactions

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.816
that we make during the day

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.560
into our long-term memory
and personalities.
