My research focuses

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.216
on what many scientists believe
is the most regenerative stage of sleep:

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.440
deep sleep.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.256
We now know that generally speaking,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.896
there are three stages of sleep:

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.256
light sleep,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.296
rapid eye movement or REM

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.520
and deep sleep.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.760
We measure these stages by connecting
electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.056
In light sleep and REM,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.320
our brain waves are very similar
to our brain waves in waking life.
