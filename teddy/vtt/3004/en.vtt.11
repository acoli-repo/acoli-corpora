00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.840
yet their brains responded
with more of these delta waves.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.176
Here's an image of someone's brain waves
from the study that we conducted.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.896
See the bottom panel?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.416
This shows the sound being played
at that burst frequency.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.536
Now look at the brain waves
in the upper part of the graph.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.496
You can see from the graph

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.000
that the sound is actually producing
more of these regenerative delta waves.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.936
We learned that we could
accurately track sleep

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.656
without hooking people up to electrodes

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.776
and make people sleep deeper.
