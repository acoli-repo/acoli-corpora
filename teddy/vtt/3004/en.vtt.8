00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.360
you could actually make sleep
deeper and more efficient.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.736
And what's more, is that this lab showed

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.256
that you actually could improve
next-day memory performance

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.480
with this sound.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.456
Dmitry and I teamed up,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.976
and we began working on a way
to build this technology.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.079
With our research lab
collaborators at Penn State,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.856
we designed experiments
in order to validate our system.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.496
And we've since received grant funding
from the National Science Foundation

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.536
and the National Institute of Health

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.480
to develop this deep-sleep
stimulating technology.
