[Recorded on October 26, 2020.

00:00:02.907 --> 00:00:04.258
COVID-19 vaccine development

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.902
and ethical considerations
around human challenge trials

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:08.148
are constantly evolving.]

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:09.854
In April 2020,

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:12.320
I made what many perceive
as a risky decision.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.765
I volunteered to be deliberately
infected with COVID-19.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.800
This infection would be part
of what is called a human challenge trial,

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.736
where young, healthy people
are given a vaccine

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.554
and are deliberately exposed
to the virus that causes COVID-19.

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:30.196
These trials help researchers
figure out more quickly
