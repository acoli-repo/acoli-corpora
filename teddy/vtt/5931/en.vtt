How many people does it take to make
a cup of coffee?

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.329
For many of us, all it takes is a short
walk and a quick pour.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.038
But this simple staple is the result 
of a globe-spanning process

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:26.204
whose cost and complexity are far greater
than you might imagine.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:31.163
It begins in a place like the remote
Colombian town of Pitalito.
