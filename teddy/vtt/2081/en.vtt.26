00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.152
that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:02.575
I took this and I gave it
to 100 MIT students.

00:13:02.599 --> 00:13:04.163
I said, "What would you choose?"

00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:08.173
These are the market shares --
most people wanted the combo deal.

00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:10.405
Thankfully, nobody wanted
the dominant option.

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:12.069
That means our students can read.

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:13.475
(Laughter)

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:16.388
But now, if you have an option
that nobody wants,

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.111
you can take it off, right?

00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:19.976
So I printed another version of this,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.817
where I eliminated the middle option.

00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:25.324
I gave it to another 100 students.
Here is what happened:

00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:28.085
Now the most popular option
became the least popular,

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:30.752
and the least popular
became the most popular.
