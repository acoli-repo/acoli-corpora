I'll give you one more example.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:03.761
This is from a paper
by Redelmeier and Shafir.

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.291
And they said, "Would this
effect also happens to experts?

00:09:07.315 --> 00:09:10.443
People who are well-paid,
experts in their decisions,

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.823
and who make a lot of them?"

00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:14.032
And they took a group of physicians.

00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:16.508
They presented to them
a case study of a patient.

00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:19.976
They said, "Here is a patient.
He is a 67-year-old farmer.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.730
He's been suffering from
right hip pain for a while."

00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.588
And then, they said to the physicians,

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:25.976
"You decided a few weeks ago

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.976
that nothing is working for this patient.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.429
All these medications,
nothing seems to be working.
