I've known heights of obsessive behavior

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
I never thought about.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.632
(Laughter)

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.548
Which I think is just fascinating.

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:09.167
I will tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior,

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.369
and I want to start by giving you
some examples of visual illusion

00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.326
as a metaphor for rationality.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.168
So think about these two tables.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:17.976
And you must have seen this illusion.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.821
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical
line on the table on the left,

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.638
or the horizontal line
on the table on the right,

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:26.976
which one seems longer?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.975
Can anybody see anything
but the left one being longer?

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.846
No, right? It's impossible.
