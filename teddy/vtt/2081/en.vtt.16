00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.433
But when it comes to us,

00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:03.095
we have such a feeling
that we're in the driver's seat,

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:06.408
such a feeling that we're in control
and we are making the decision,

00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:09.031
that it's very hard
to even accept the idea

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.730
that we actually have an illusion
of making a decision,

00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:13.818
rather than an actual decision.

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:16.310
Now, you might say,

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:18.751
"These are decisions we don't care about."

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:21.048
In fact, by definition,
these are decisions

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:23.655
about something that will happen
to us after we die.

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:25.799
How could we care about something less

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:28.112
than about something
that happens after we die?

00:08:28.136 --> 00:08:31.058
So a standard economist,
somebody who believes in rationality,
