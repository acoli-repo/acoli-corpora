WEBVTT

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.699
a print subscription for 125 dollars,

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:33.976
or you could get both for 125.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.976
(Laughter)

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.585
Now I looked at this,
and I called up The Economist,

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:41.172
and I tried to figure out
what they were thinking.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.338
And they passed me from one person
to another to another,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:48.085
until eventually I got to the person
who was in charge of the website,

00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:51.704
and I called them up, and they went
to check what was going on.

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:55.575
The next thing I know,
the ad is gone, no explanation.

00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:57.486
So I decided to do the experiment

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.152
that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.
