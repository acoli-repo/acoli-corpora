Very good for the physicians.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:03.482
To the other group
of physicians, they said,

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:07.355
"Yesterday when you reviewed the case,
you discovered there were two medications

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:09.895
you didn't try out yet --
ibuprofen and piroxicam."

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:12.170
You have two medications
you didn't try out yet.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:14.837
What do you do? You let him go,
or you pull him back?

00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:18.305
And if you pull him back, do you try
ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:19.485
Now, think of it:

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.381
This decision makes it as easy to let
the patient continue with hip replacement,

00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:26.531
but pulling him back, all of the sudden
it becomes more complex.

00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:28.373
There is one more decision.

00:10:28.397 --> 00:10:29.723
What happens now?

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:33.366
The majority of the physicians
now choose to let the patient go
