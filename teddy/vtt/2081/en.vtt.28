00:13:58.078 --> 00:14:00.769
is that we actually don't know
our preferences that well.

00:14:00.793 --> 00:14:03.263
And because we don't know
our preferences that well,

00:14:03.287 --> 00:14:06.576
we're susceptible to all of these
influences from the external forces:

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.276
the defaults, the particular options
that are presented to us, and so on.

00:14:10.632 --> 00:14:11.976
One more example of this.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.357
People believe that when we deal
with physical attraction,

00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:18.644
we see somebody, and we know immediately
whether we like them or not,

00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:19.976
if we're attracted or not.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.432
This is why we have
these four-minute dates.

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:24.976
So I decided to do
this experiment with people.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.976
I'll show you images here, no real people,
but the experiment was with people.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.976
I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
