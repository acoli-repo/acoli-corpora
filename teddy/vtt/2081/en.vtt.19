00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.429
All these medications,
nothing seems to be working.

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.225
So you refer the patient
for hip replacement therapy.

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:34.976
Hip replacement. Okay?"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.975
So the patient is on a path
to have his hip replaced.

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:40.425
Then they said to half of the physicians,

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.788
"Yesterday, you reviewed
the patient's case,

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:45.422
and you realized that you forgot
to try one medication.

00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:47.042
You did not try ibuprofen.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.325
What do you do? Do you pull
the patient back and try ibuprofen?

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.119
Or do you let him go
and have hip replacement?"

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:56.794
Well, the good news is
that most physicians in this case

00:09:56.818 --> 00:09:59.627
decided to pull the patient
and try ibuprofen.

00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:01.391
Very good for the physicians.
