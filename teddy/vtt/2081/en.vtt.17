00:08:28.136 --> 00:08:31.058
So a standard economist,
somebody who believes in rationality,

00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:32.335
would say, "You know what?

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:35.811
The cost of lifting the pencil
and marking a "V" is higher

00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:37.976
than the possible benefit of the decision,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.798
so that's why we get this effect."

00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:40.831
(Laughter)

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:43.353
But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:46.393
It's not because it's trivial.
It's not because we don't care.

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.838
It's the opposite. It's because we care.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.806
It's difficult and it's complex.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.381
And it's so complex
that we don't know what to do.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:55.381
And because we have no idea what to do,

00:08:55.405 --> 00:08:58.976
we just pick whatever it was
that was chosen for us.

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:01.150
I'll give you one more example.
