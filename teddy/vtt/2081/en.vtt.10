00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.920
they would be interested
in donating their organs.

00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:04.869
These are different countries in Europe.

00:05:04.893 --> 00:05:06.854
You basically see two types of countries:

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:09.480
countries on the right,
that seem to be giving a lot;

00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:12.463
and countries on the left
that seem to giving very little,

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:14.090
or much less.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.266
The question is, why?

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.614
Why do some countries give a lot
and some countries give a little?

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.266
When you ask people this question,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.822
they usually think that it has
to be about culture.

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:24.472
How much do you care about people?

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:25.976
Giving organs to somebody else

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.334
is probably about how much you care
about society, how linked you are.

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:30.976
Or maybe it's about religion.
