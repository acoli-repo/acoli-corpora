The second point, or course, is that
if somebody invites you to bar hop,

00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:33.268
you know what they think about you.

00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:35.976
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.282
Now you get it.

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:39.976
What is the general point?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.258
The general point is that,

00:15:41.282 --> 00:15:44.976
when we think about economics, we have
this beautiful view of human nature.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.537
"What a piece of work is a man!
How noble in reason!"

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:50.139
We have this view of ourselves, of others.

00:15:50.163 --> 00:15:55.377

is slightly less "generous" to people;

00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.500
in fact, in medical terms,

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:58.716
that's our view.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.867
(Laughter)
