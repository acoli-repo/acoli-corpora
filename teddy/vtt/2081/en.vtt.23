00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:31.167
in this set, influence anything?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.305
(Laughter)

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:37.778
But what if the option to have your car
stolen was not exactly like this?

00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:40.334
What if it was a trip to Rome,
all expenses paid,

00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:42.636
transportation, breakfast,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.976
but it doesn't include
coffee in the morning?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.373
If you want coffee, you have to pay
for it yourself, it's two euros 50.

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:49.404
(Laughter)

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:50.976
Now in some ways,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.299
given that you can have Rome with coffee,

00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:55.704
why would you possibly
want Rome without coffee?

00:11:55.728 --> 00:11:58.672
It's like having your car stolen.
It's an inferior option.

00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:00.466
But guess what happened?
