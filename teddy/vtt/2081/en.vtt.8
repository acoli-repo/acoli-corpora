00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.674
bigger than dedicated to anything else.

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.546
We use our vision more hours
of the day than anything else.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.640
We're evolutionarily
designed to use vision.

00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:09.640
And if we have these predictable
repeatable mistakes in vision,

00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:11.170
which we're so good at,

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.758
what are the chances we won't make
even more mistakes

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:17.333
in something we're not as good at,
for example, financial decision-making.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.976
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.650
Something we don't have
an evolutionary reason to do,

00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:24.024
we don't have a specialized
part of the brain for,

00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:26.063
and we don't do that many
hours of the day.

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:28.055
The argument is in those cases,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.976
it might be that we actually
make many more mistakes.
