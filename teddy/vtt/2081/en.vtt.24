00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.976
makes Rome with coffee look superior,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.976
and not just to Rome without coffee --
even superior to Paris.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.077

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:28.190
an online subscription for 59 dollars,

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.699
a print subscription for 125 dollars,
