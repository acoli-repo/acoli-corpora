Until somebody said,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.826
"Look, if you're serious about this,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.381
you have to write about your research
first; you have to publish something,

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:10.103
then you'll get the opportunity
to write something else.

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:12.398
If you really want to do it,
you have to do it."

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.767
I said, "I don't want to write
about my research.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.008
I do it all day long,

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:19.524
I want to write something
a bit more free, less constrained."

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.976
And this person
was very forceful and said,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.576
"Look, that's the only way
you'll ever do it."

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.910
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --"

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.093
I had a sabbatical.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:31.076
I said, "I'll write about my research,
if there's no other way.
