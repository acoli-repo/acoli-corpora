00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.976
I can cover the rest of the cube up.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.406
If I cover the rest of the cube,
you can see that they are identical.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.867
If you don't believe me,
you can get the slide later

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:39.707
and do some arts and crafts
and see that they're identical.

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.064
But again, it's the same story,
that if we take the background away,

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:45.293
the illusion comes back.

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.294
There is no way for us not
to see this illusion.

00:03:48.318 --> 00:03:51.635
I guess maybe if you're colorblind,
I don't think you can see that.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.976
I want you to think
about illusion as a metaphor.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.135
Vision is one of the best things we do.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.755
We have a huge part of our brain
dedicated to vision --

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.674
bigger than dedicated to anything else.
