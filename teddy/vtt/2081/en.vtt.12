00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.166
you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.014
but it turns out that with organ
donation, they are very different.

00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:09.477
By the way, the Netherlands
is an interesting story.

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.120
You see, the Netherlands is kind
of the biggest of the small group.

00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:16.976
It turns out that they got to 28 percent

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.279
after mailing every household
in the country a letter,

00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:22.976
begging people to join
this organ donation program.

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:26.480
You know the expression,
"Begging only gets you so far."

00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:28.976
It's 28 percent in organ donation.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.869
