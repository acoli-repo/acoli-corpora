00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.976
I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.069
and I said, "Who do you want to date?

00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:35.568
Tom or Jerry?"

00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:38.871
But for half the people,
I added an ugly version of Jerry.

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:43.976
I took Photoshop and I made
Jerry slightly less attractive.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.413
(Laughter)

00:14:45.437 --> 00:14:48.976
For the other people, I added
an ugly version of Tom.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.976
And the question was,
will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.768
help their respective,
more attractive brothers?

00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:58.021
The answer was absolutely yes.

00:14:58.045 --> 00:15:00.191
When ugly Jerry was around,
Jerry was popular.
