00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.869
(Laughter)

00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:33.623
But whatever the countries
on the right are doing,

00:06:33.647 --> 00:06:35.758
they're doing a much
better job than begging.

00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:37.090
So what are they doing?

00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:40.582
Turns out the secret has to do
with a form at the DMV.

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:41.976
And here is the story.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.507
The countries on the left
have a form at the DMV

00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:46.222
that looks something like this.

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:50.531
"Check the box below if you want to
participate in the organ donor program."

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:51.976
And what happens?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.309
People don't check, and they don't join.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.502
The countries on the right,
the ones that give a lot,

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:59.128
have a slightly different form.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:02.652
It says, "Check the box below
if you don't want to participate ..."
