00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.976
it might be that we actually
make many more mistakes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.773
And worse -- not having
an easy way to see them,

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:38.026
because in visual illusions, we can
easily demonstrate the mistakes;

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.137
in cognitive illusion
it's much, much harder

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:41.976
to demonstrate the mistakes to people.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.976
So I want to show you
some cognitive illusions,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.082
or decision-making illusions,
in the same way.

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:51.582
And this is one of my favorite
plots in social sciences.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:55.444
It's from a paper
by Johnson and Goldstein.

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:59.166
It basically shows the percentage
of people who indicated

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.920
they would be interested
in donating their organs.
