Or maybe it's about religion.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.955
But if you look at this plot,

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.406
you can see that countries
that we think about as very similar,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.572
actually exhibit very different behavior.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.469
For example, Sweden
is all the way on the right,

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:44.152
and Denmark, which we think
is culturally very similar,

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.976
is all the way on the left.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.976
Germany is on the left,
and Austria is on the right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.316
The Netherlands is on the left,
and Belgium is on the right.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.976
And finally, depending
on your particular version

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
of European similarity,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.166
you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,
