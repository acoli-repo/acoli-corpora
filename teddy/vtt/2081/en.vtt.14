It says, "Check the box below
if you don't want to participate ..."

00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:04.866
Interestingly enough,
when people get this,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.976
they again don't check, but now they join.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.976
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.912
Now, think about what this means.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.976
You know, we wake up in the morning
and we feel we make decisions.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.310
We wake up in the morning
and we open the closet;

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.118
we feel that we decide what to wear.

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:24.214
we open the refrigerator and we feel
that we decide what to eat.

00:07:24.238 --> 00:07:25.737
What this is actually saying,

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.571
is that many of these decisions
are not residing within us.

00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.372
They are residing in the person
who is designing that form.
