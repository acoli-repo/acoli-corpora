00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:03.833
Right? It's impossible to overcome
this sense that this is indeed longer.

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:05.484
Our intuition is really fooling us

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:07.655
in a repeatable,
predictable, consistent way.

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.976
and there is almost nothing
we can do about it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.976
aside from taking a ruler
and starting to measure it.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.174
Here's another one.
It's one of my favorite illusions.

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.887
What color is the top arrow pointing to?

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.131
Audience: Brown.
Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:24.124
The bottom one? Yellow.

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:25.489
Turns out they're identical.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:27.424
Can anybody see them as identical?

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:28.822
Very, very hard.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.976
I can cover the rest of the cube up.
