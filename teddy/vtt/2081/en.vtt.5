00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.846
No, right? It's impossible.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.762
But the nice thing about visual illusion
is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.249
So I can put some lines
on; it doesn't help.

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:39.975
I can animate the lines.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.667
And to the extent you believe
I didn't shrink the lines,

00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.479
which I didn't, I've proven to you
that your eyes were deceiving you.

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:50.976
Now, the interesting thing about this
is when I take the lines away,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.810
it's as if you haven't learned
anything in the last minute.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.054
(Laughter)

00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:59.769
You can't look at this and say,
"Now I see reality as it is."

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:03.833
Right? It's impossible to overcome
this sense that this is indeed longer.
