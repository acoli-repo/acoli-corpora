00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:30.911
and every day of the week,

00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:34.027
some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them.

00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.768
I happened to be there

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:38.346
the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.335
and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea.

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.577
So I went over and talked to him

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:49.228
about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels.

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:51.690
(Laughter)

00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:55.617
Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English.

00:09:55.641 --> 00:09:59.658
So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew:

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.877
ice cream.
