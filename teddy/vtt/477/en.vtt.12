00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.956
So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.299
and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture.

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:07.465
When the big day came,

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:10.895
we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.399
and headed to the airport
to meet our family.

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:18.188
It was a little overwhelming for everyone,

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.129
especially the four-year-old.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.573
His mother was reunited with her sister

00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:26.652
who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program.

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:30.591
They hadn't seen each other in 15 years.
