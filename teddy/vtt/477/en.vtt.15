00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:32.139
we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money

00:07:32.163 --> 00:07:34.751

00:07:40.946 --> 00:07:42.488
of promoting children's health.

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:48.440

such a big, broad charity

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:50.447

00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:59.267
In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise:

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.896
for every 10 dollars donated,
