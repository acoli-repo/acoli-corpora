00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.613
Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses.

00:02:31.357 --> 00:02:34.169
The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy

00:02:34.193 --> 00:02:37.051
when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves,

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.909
but they were actually even happier

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:41.786
when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away.

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:46.841
And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:51.110
When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults

00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:52.687
across the globe,

00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.923
we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:59.871
reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month.
