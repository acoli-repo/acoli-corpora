I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins,

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:04.556
and he was talking about them,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.094
but also about our Syrian family.

00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:09.673
Since our family arrived,

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:13.857
so many people and organizations
have offered to help,

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.426
providing everything
from free dental fillings

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.455
to summer camps.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:24.222
It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.577
Thanks to one donation,

00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:29.389
the kids got to go to bike camp,

00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:30.911
and every day of the week,
