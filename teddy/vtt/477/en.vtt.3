00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.809
we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about,

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.518
so we used the toddler equivalent of gold,

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.907
namely, Goldfish crackers.

00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:41.240
(Laughter)

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:44.901
We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.942
and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.952
to a puppet named Monkey.

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:52.625
(Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats,

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.934
and I'm going to give them all to you.

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.793
Toddler: Ooh. Thank you.

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.438
Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats.
