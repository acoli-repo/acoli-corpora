00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:30.953
It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.216
Pretty early on in my career,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.536
I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.741
entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness."

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:43.315
I was very confident in this conclusion,

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.375
except for one thing:

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.514
it didn't seem to apply to me.

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:49.766
(Laughter)

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.092
I hardly ever gave money to charity,

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.308
and when I did,

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:56.174
I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:02.876
So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research
