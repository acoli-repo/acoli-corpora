00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:33.410
I actually wasn't doing very much of it.

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:36.025
So I resolved to give more.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.778
Around that time,

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:42.536
devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.199
were everywhere.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.356
I really wanted to help,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.178
so I pulled out my credit card.

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:54.470
I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere,

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:57.424
but going to the website
of an effective charity

00:04:57.448 --> 00:04:59.542
and entering my Visa number

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.004
still just didn't feel like enough.
