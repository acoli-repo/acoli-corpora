if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:34.637
that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike,

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.510
you start to wonder:

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:39.334
Could this be part of human nature?

00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:44.401
We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.317
like eating and sex

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:49.392
that help perpetuate our species,

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:53.791
and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.441
I was really excited about these ideas,

00:03:57.465 --> 00:03:59.904
and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times."
