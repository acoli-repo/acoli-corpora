And instead of a Group of Five,

00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:35.615

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.526
and forming a group of 25.

of paperwork and waiting,

00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.205
we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.087

00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:58.984
but it needed quite a bit of work.

00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.956
So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends
