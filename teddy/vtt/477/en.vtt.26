We need to create opportunities to give

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:14.102
that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity.

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:17.173
If any of you work for a charity,

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:20.641

with pens or calendars.

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.778

00:13:27.703 --> 00:13:31.963
to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having
