00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.729
So, I have a pretty fun job,

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:07.032
which is to figure out
what makes people happy.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.311
It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous,

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:14.770
especially at a time where
we're being confronted

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.344
with some pretty depressing headlines.

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:22.449
But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key

00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:26.366
to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing.

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:30.953
It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out.
