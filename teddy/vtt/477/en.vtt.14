00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:01.046
But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.441
we all had the same realization:

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.109
we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy.

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:13.525
This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research.

00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:15.272
Back in my lab,

00:07:15.296 --> 00:07:18.088
we'd seen the benefits of giving spike

00:07:18.112 --> 00:07:22.088
when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping

00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:24.827
and could easily envision
the difference they were making

00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:26.388
in those individuals' lives.

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:29.204
For example, in one experiment,

00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:32.139
we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money
