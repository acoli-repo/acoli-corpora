00:12:00.216 --> 00:12:03.296
Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.248
and sends a team of volunteers

00:12:05.272 --> 00:12:07.216
who help make and serve the meal.

00:12:07.732 --> 00:12:12.618
Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street,

00:12:12.642 --> 00:12:14.661
and importantly, there's enough money left

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:17.205
to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community

00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:18.799
in the days that follow.

00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:23.094
But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:28.323
For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people,

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:31.256
to sit down and hear their stories.
