My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid

00:11:30.347 --> 00:11:32.616
and his parents drove
through this neighborhood,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.157
he would duck down in the back seat.

00:11:36.077 --> 00:11:38.614
But Evan's parents
never would have guessed

00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:40.255
that when he grew up,

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:42.980
he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant

00:11:43.004 --> 00:11:47.319
and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners.

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:51.868
The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates,"

00:11:51.892 --> 00:11:54.309
and the goal is not just
to provide free meals

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:56.359
but to create moments of connection

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:59.779
between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact.
