One of the people who read this article

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.198
was my accountant.

00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:07.267
(Laughter)

00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:08.453
Yeah.

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:12.527
At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him,

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:15.511
watching as he slowly tapped his pen

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:18.415
on the charitable giving line
of my tax return

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.456
with this look of, like,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.877
poorly concealed disapproval.

00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:24.952
(Laughter)

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:29.852
Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel,

00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:33.410
I actually wasn't doing very much of it.
