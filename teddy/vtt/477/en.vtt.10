00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.004
still just didn't feel like enough.

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:06.732
That's when I learned
about the Group of Five.

00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:11.304
The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:14.420
to privately sponsor a family of refugees.

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.933
You have to raise enough money
to support the family

00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:19.890
for their first year in Canada,

00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:23.590
and then they literally
get on a plane to your city.

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:28.358
One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:30.843
is that no one is allowed to do it alone.
