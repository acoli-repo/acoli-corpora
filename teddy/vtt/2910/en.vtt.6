Many people find mixed-race
individuals attractive

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.939
and inbred families less so.

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:12.810
The second factor that contributes
to beauty is symmetry.

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:17.800
People generally find symmetric faces
more attractive than asymmetric ones.

00:03:18.758 --> 00:03:24.010
Developmental abnormalities
are often associated with asymmetries.

00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:27.299
And in plants, animals and humans,

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.629
asymmetries often arise
from parasitic infections.
