00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.425
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:34.682
Here, the logic is turned on its head.

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:37.807
Instead of a fitness indicator,

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:41.238
scientists invoke a handicap principle.

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.321
The most commonly cited
example of a handicap

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:47.836
is the peacock's tail.

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:52.938
This beautiful but cumbersome tail
doesn't exactly help the peacock

00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:54.224
avoid predators

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.367
and approach peahens.

00:05:57.188 --> 00:06:00.640
Why should such an extravagant
appendage evolve?
