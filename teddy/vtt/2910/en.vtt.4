while this decision is certainly
subjective for the individual,

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:08.311
it's sculpted by factors that contribute
to the survival of the group.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.458
Many experiments have shown

00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:15.483
that a few basic parameters contribute
to what makes a face attractive.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:21.991
These include averaging, symmetry
and the effects of hormones.

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:24.425
Let's take each one of these in turn.

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.005
Galton's finding

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:33.312
that composite or average faces
are typically more attractive
