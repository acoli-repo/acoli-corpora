00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:33.338
The selection criteria
for reproductive success from that time

00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:35.227
doesn't really apply today.

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:37.456
For example,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.547
death by parasite is not one
of the top ways that people die,

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.462
at least not in the technologically
developed world.

00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:48.357
From antibiotics to surgery,

00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:51.873
birth control to in vitro fertilization,

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:55.287
the filters for reproductive success
are being relaxed.

00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:58.611
And under these relaxed conditions,

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:02.869
preference and trait combinations
are free to drift
