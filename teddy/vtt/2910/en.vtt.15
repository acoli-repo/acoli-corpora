Teenagers and young adults are not exactly
known for making decisions

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:37.343
that are predicated on health concerns.

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.145
But they don't have to be,

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.652
and let me explain why.

00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:44.502
Imagine a population

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:49.386
in which people have three different
kinds of preferences:

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.735
for green, for orange and for red.

00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:55.113
From their point of view,

00:07:55.137 --> 00:07:57.500
these preferences have
nothing to do with health;

00:07:57.524 --> 00:07:59.016
they just like what they like.
