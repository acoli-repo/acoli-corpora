These kinds of observations
reveal beauty's ugly side.

00:12:07.796 --> 00:12:09.869
In my lab, we recently found

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:14.815
that people with minor facial
anomalies and disfigurements

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:18.623
are regarded as less good, less kind,

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:23.078
less intelligent, less competent
and less hardworking.

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:29.138
Unfortunately, we also have
a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.
