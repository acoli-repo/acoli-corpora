00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.083
and high cheekbones
as an indicator of maturity.

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:07.847
Testosterone produces features
that we regard as typically masculine.

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:10.797
These include heavier brows,

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.126
thinner cheeks

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.402
and bigger, squared-off jaws.

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.216
But here's a fascinating irony.

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:18.846
In many species,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.251
if anything,

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:23.967
testosterone suppresses the immune system.

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:29.176
So the idea that testosterone-infused
features are a fitness indicator

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.425
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.
