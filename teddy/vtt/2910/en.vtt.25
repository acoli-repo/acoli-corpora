This stereotype is probably
exploited and magnified

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.493
by images in popular media,

00:12:39.517 --> 00:12:43.413
in which facial disfigurement
is often used as a shorthand

00:12:43.437 --> 00:12:46.095
to depict someone of villainous character.

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.832
We need to understand
these kinds of implicit biases

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:52.593
if we are to overcome them

00:12:52.617 --> 00:12:56.298
and aim for a society
in which we treat people fairly,

00:12:56.322 --> 00:13:00.737
based on their behavior and not
on the happenstance of their looks.
