00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:30.707
and this happens even when people
aren't explicitly thinking

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.334
about beauty or goodness.

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:37.865
Our brains seem to reflexively
associate beauty and good.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.668
And this reflexive association
may be the biologic trigger

00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:45.374
for the many social effects of beauty.

00:11:46.057 --> 00:11:50.451
Attractive people receive
all kinds of advantages in life.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.310
They're regarded as more intelligent,

00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:55.937
more trustworthy,

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.506
they're given higher pay
and lesser punishments,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.252
even when such judgments
are not warranted.
