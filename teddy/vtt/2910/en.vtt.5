00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:33.312
that composite or average faces
are typically more attractive

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:36.893
than each individual face
that contributes to the average

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.846
has been replicated many times.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:44.122
This laboratory finding fits
with many people's intuitions.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:48.965
Average faces represent
the central tendencies of a group.

00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:54.043
People with mixed features
represent different populations,

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:57.415
and presumably harbor
greater genetic diversity

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.637
and adaptability to the environment.
