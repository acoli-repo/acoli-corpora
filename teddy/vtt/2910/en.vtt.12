Why should such an extravagant
appendage evolve?

00:06:01.947 --> 00:06:03.542
Even Charles Darwin,

00:06:04.408 --> 00:06:07.807
in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:11.603
that the sight of the peacock's tail
made him physically ill.

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:15.042
He couldn't explain it
with his theory of natural selection,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:16.965
and out of this frustration,

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:20.173
he developed the theory
of sexual selection.

00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.651
On this account,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:27.058
the display of the peacock's tail
is about sexual enticement,

00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:33.304
and this enticement means
it's more likely the peacock will mate
