00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:34.662
and have offspring.

00:06:35.818 --> 00:06:38.807
Now, the modern twist
on this display argument

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:44.442
is that the peacock is also
advertising its health to the peahen.

00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:51.128
Only especially fit organisms
can afford to divert resources

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:53.850
to maintaining such
an extravagant appendage.

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:59.485
Only especially fit men can afford
the price that testosterone levies

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.778
on their immune system.
