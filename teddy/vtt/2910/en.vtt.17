00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:31.084
Now, a scientist coming in
and sampling this population

00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:34.757
discovers that green
preferences are universal.

00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:39.478
So the point about this little
abstract example

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:44.162
is that while preferences
for specific physical features

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.749
can be arbitrary for the individual,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.860
if those features are heritable

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.391
and they are associated
with a reproductive advantage,

00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:58.629
over time,

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.580
they become universal for the group.
