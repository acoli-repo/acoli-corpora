00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
vast areas of leisure and culture

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
you find people who want to do things because they love it,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but they want to do these things to very high standards.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
They work at their leisure, if you like.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They take their leisure very seriously:

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
they acquire skills; they invest time;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
cameras, design technology,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Largely through globalization,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
