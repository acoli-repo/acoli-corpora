00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
will only come --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
from an open-source kind of project.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in these closed organizations --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
they might be academics; they might be programmers;

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
they might be doctors; they might be journalists --
