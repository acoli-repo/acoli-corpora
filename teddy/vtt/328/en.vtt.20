00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
with Dobsonian digital telescopes --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
which are pretty much open source --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
with some light sensors

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
developed over the last 10 years, the Internet --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of new productive resources.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The users can be producers.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
What does this mean, then, for our

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
organizational landscape?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, just imagine a world,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for the moment, divided into two camps.
