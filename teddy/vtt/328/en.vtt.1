Let me just ask you, to start with,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
this simple question:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who invented the mountain bike?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because traditional economic theory would say,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that had a big R&amp;D lab

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
where they were thinking up new projects,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
working in his garage, who,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with a bike out of thin air.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It didn't come from there. The mountain bike

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
came from users, came from young users,
