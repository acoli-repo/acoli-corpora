WEBVTT

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and funding to make that possible?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
What's the role of the BBC,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
for instance, in that world?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
What should be the role of public policy?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And finally, what I think you will see

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is the intelligent, closed organizations

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
moving increasingly in the open direction.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
mixing closed and open in tricky ways.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --
