00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for the moment, divided into two camps.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
special people, special places;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
patent it, push it down the pipeline

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to largely waiting, passive consumers.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Over here, let's imagine we've got

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is open; this is closed.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is new; this is traditional.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is what Yochai has said already --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
is there is a great big struggle

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
between those two organizational forms.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
These people over there will do everything they can
