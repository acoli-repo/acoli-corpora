00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Take astronomy as an example,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
which Yochai has already mentioned.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
only big professional astronomers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
with very big telescopes could see far into space.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and when I was a kid, it was amazing,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000


And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Now, six

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
with Dobsonian digital telescopes --
