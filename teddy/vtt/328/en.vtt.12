00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The truth is that most creativity

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is cumulative and collaborative;

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The second reason why users are more and more important

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
If you want to find the big new ideas,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in big organizations.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And just look inside large organizations

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and you'll see why that is so.
