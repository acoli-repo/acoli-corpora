More special people, more special places.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Build creative clusters in cities;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I think it's always been wrong,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and it's probably been largely interactive.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The ideas are coming back from the consumers,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and they're often ahead of the producers.
