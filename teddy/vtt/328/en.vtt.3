00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
mountain bikes were known as "clunkers."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And they were just made in a community of bikers,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
mainly in Northern California.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And then one of these companies that was importing parts

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for the clunkers decided to set up in business,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
start selling them to other people,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and it probably was, I don't know,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
10, maybe even 15, years,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
before the big bike companies

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
realized there was a market.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Thirty years later,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
