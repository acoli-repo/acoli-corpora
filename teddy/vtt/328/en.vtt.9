00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and they're often ahead of the producers.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Why is that?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, one issue

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is that radical innovation,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
when you've got ideas that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
affect a large number of technologies or people,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The payoffs to innovation are greatest

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
where the uncertainty is highest.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And when you get a radical innovation,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The whole history of telephony

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.
