00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
How many people does he employ

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
to service that population?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
500 people.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Well, how can he service

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
250 million people from 500 employees?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Because basically, he doesn't service them.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
He gives them a platform;

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
he orchestrates the action.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But actually, a lot of the content

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is created by the users themselves.
