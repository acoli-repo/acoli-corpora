00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the more you need innovation in use

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to work out what a technology is for.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
All of our patents, our entire approach

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to patents and invention, is based on the idea

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that the inventor knows what the invention is for;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
we can say what it's for.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
More and more, the inventors of things

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
will not be able to say that in advance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It will be worked out in use,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in collaboration with users.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We like to think that invention is

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
a sort of moment of creation:

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.
