would never have come from the big companies.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Had to start -- this is the third point --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
with these pro-ams.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is the phrase that I've used in

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
some stuff which I've done

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with a think tank in London called Demos,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
i.e., they do it for the love of it --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but they want to do it to very high standards.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And across a whole range of fields --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
from software, astronomy,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
natural sciences,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
vast areas of leisure and culture

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --
