00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Special people, special places, think up special ideas,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
down to the waiting consumers, who are passive.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That's the idea of creativity.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
What's the policy recommendation out of that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
if you're in government, or you're running a large company?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
More special people, more special places.
