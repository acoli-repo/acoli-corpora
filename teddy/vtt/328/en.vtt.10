00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The very first landline telephones,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the inventors thought

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they would be used for people to listen in

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to live performances

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
from West End theaters.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
they had no idea what it was for;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it was only when that technology got into the hands

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
of teenage users

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that they invented the use.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So the more radical the innovation,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the more the uncertainty,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the more you need innovation in use
