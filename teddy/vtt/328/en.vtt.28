What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and these, I think, are two challenges

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
for the open movement.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The first is:

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
can we really survive on volunteers?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
If this is so critical,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
do we not need it funded, organized, supported

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in much more structured ways?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
What kind of changes do we need in public policy

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and funding to make that possible?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
