WEBVTT

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is created by the users themselves.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And it creates a kind of stickiness

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
between the community and the company

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
which is really, really powerful.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
you create a character

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
that you develop in the course of the game.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or there's some other problem,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
you lose your character.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You've got two options.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
One option: you can create a new character,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
That costs about 100 dollars.
