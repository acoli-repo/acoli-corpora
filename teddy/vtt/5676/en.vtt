Let me tell you a story
about artificial intelligence.

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.516
There's a building in Sydney
at 1 Bligh Street.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.770
It houses lots of government apartments

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:11.243
and busy people.

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:14.791
From the outside, it looks like something
out of American science fiction:

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.529
all gleaming glass and curved lines,

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:19.720
and a piece of orange sculpture.

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.672
On the inside, it has excellent coffee
on the ground floor

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.347
and my favorite lifts in Sydney.

00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:25.672
They're beautiful;

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:27.816
they look almost alive.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.308
And it turns out
I'm fascinated with lifts.
