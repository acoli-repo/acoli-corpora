00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.037
The second result
was that about half of those genes

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:05.496
were actually increased in their activity.

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:07.787
The other half were decreased.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.704
Now those genes that were switched off
by a lack of sleep

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:15.246
were genes associated
with your immune system,

00:13:15.246 --> 00:13:18.121
so once again, you can see
that immune deficiency.

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:22.412
In contrast, those genes
that were actually upregulated

00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:24.829
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:28.746
were genes associated
with the promotion of tumors,

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:33.912
genes associated with long-term
chronic inflammation within the body,
