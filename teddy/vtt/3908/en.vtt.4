00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.913
that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea.

00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:04.579
So we took a group of individuals

00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:08.163
and we assigned them
to one of two experimental groups:

00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:11.663
a sleep group
and a sleep deprivation group.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:16.288
Now the sleep group, they're going to get
a full eight hours of slumber,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.996
but the deprivation group,
we're going to keep them awake

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.163
in the laboratory, under full supervision.

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:26.038
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,
so it's miserable for everyone involved.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.121
And then the next day,

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:32.454
we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner
