00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:32.996
on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus.

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.788
And you can think of the hippocampus

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.038
almost like the informational
inbox of your brain.

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.829
It's very good at receiving
new memory files

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.329
and then holding on to them.

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.621
And when you look at this structure

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.704
in those people who'd had
a full night of sleep,

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:53.288
we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity.

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:57.579
Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived,

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:01.246
we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever.
