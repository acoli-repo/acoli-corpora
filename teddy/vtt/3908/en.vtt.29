avoiding naps during the day,

00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:32.329
I have two pieces of advice for you.

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.912
The first is regularity.

00:14:35.954 --> 00:14:39.329
Go to bed at the same time,
wake up at the same time,

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:42.412
no matter whether
it's the weekday or the weekend.

00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:45.204
Regularity is king,

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:47.162
and it will anchor your sleep

00:14:47.204 --> 00:14:50.496
and improve the quantity
and the quality of that sleep.

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:55.037
The second is keep it cool.

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:58.496
Your body needs to drop
its core temperature

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:02.746
by about two to three degrees
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep
