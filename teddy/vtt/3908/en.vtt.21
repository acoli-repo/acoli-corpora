00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.871
you're simply going to have your sleep
restricted to four hours

00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:34.662
for one single night,

00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:37.662
and then we're going to look to see
what's the percent reduction

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.704
in immune cell activity that you suffer.

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.579
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,

00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.621
it's not 20 percent.

00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:50.204
There was a 70-percent drop
in natural killer cell activity.

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:55.829
That's a concerning state
of immune deficiency,

00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.162
and you can perhaps understand
why we're now finding
