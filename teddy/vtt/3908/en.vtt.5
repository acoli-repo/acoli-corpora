00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:32.454
we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:36.246
and we're going to have them
try and learn a whole list of new facts

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.579
as we're taking snapshots
of brain activity.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.579
And then we're going to test them

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.079
to see how effective
that learning has been.

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:47.871
And that's what you're looking at
here on the vertical axis.

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:51.204
And when you put
those two groups head to head,

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:56.246
what you find is a quite significant,
40-percent deficit

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.746
in the ability of the brain
to make new memories without sleep.
