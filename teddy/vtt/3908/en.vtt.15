00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:31.329
You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,

00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:33.579
so small you typically don't feel it,

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.496
but it has a measurable impact.

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:43.163
Now if you apply this stimulation
during sleep in young, healthy adults,

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:47.913
as if you're sort of singing in time
with those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:52.454
not only can you amplify
the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:57.038
but in doing so, we can almost
double the amount of memory benefit

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.079
that you get from sleep.

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:01.913
The question now
is whether we can translate
