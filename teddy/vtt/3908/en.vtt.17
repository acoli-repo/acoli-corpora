00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:40.954
We've already spoken about sleep loss
and your reproductive system.

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.704
Or I could tell you about sleep loss
and your cardiovascular system,

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:49.912
and that all it takes is one hour.

00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:55.454
Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:59.746
across 70 countries twice a year,

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:01.662
and it's called daylight saving time.
