00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:32.621
And you see exactly the same profile
for car crashes, road traffic accidents,

00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:34.537
even suicide rates.

00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:39.829
But as a deeper dive,

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.329
sleep loss and your immune system.

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:47.996
And here, I'll introduce these delightful

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:51.204
They are called natural killer cells,

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:56.079

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:57.704
of your immune system.

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:02.704
They are very good at identifying
dangerous, unwanted elements
