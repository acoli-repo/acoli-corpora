Not only will I tell you
about the wonderfully good things

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.496
that happen when you get sleep,

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:07.996
but the alarmingly bad things
that happen when you don't get enough,

00:01:08.038 --> 00:01:10.538
both for your brain and for your body.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.788
Let me start with the brain

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.829
and the functions of learning and memory,

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.121
because what we've discovered
over the past 10 or so years

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.038
is that you need sleep after learning

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.371
to essentially hit the save button
on those new memories

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.663
so that you don't forget.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:34.454
But recently, we discovered
that you also need sleep before learning
