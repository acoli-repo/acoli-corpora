00:12:28.037 --> 00:12:31.954
So here in this study,
they took a group of healthy adults

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:35.746
and they limited them
to six hours of sleep a night

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:37.412
for one week,

00:12:37.412 --> 00:12:41.246
and then they measured the change
in their gene activity profile

00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:43.704
relative to when those same individuals

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:46.287
were getting a full eight hours
of sleep a night.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:49.246
And there were two critical findings.

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:55.287
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes

00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:57.621
were distorted in their activity,

00:12:57.662 --> 00:12:59.079
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.037
The second result
was that about half of those genes
