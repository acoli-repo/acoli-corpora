00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.871
I think this should be concerning,

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.121
considering what we know
is happening to sleep

00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:07.579
in our education populations right now.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.371
In fact, to put that in context,

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:13.871
it would be the difference
in a child acing an exam

00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:16.788
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:22.496
And we've gone on to discover
what goes wrong within your brain

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.621
to produce these types
of learning disabilities.

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:28.329
And there's a structure that sits

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:32.996
on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus.
