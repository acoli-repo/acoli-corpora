00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:34.454
But recently, we discovered
that you also need sleep before learning

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.538
to actually prepare your brain,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.621
almost like a dry sponge

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.121
ready to initially soak up
new information.

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:46.288
And without sleep,
the memory circuits of the brain

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:49.079
essentially become
waterlogged, as it were,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.246
and you can't absorb new memories.

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.079
So let me show you the data.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.329
Here in this study, we decided
to test the hypothesis

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.913
that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea.
