because we may be able
to do something about it.

00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:12.454
And one way that we are
approaching this at my sleep center

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:15.496
is not by using
sleeping pills, by the way.

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:20.454
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments
that do not produce naturalistic sleep.

00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:24.788
Instead, we're actually developing
a method based on this.

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:27.996
It's called direct current
brain stimulation.

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:31.329
You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,
