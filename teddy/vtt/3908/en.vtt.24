Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:09.121
And if increasing your risk
for the development of cancer

00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:11.371
or even Alzheimer's disease

00:12:11.412 --> 00:12:15.579
were not sufficiently disquieting,

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:19.287
we have since discovered
that a lack of sleep will even erode

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:23.412
the very fabric of biological life itself,

00:12:24.662 --> 00:12:26.662

00:12:28.037 --> 00:12:31.954
So here in this study,
they took a group of healthy adults
