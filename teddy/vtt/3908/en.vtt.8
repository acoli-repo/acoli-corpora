we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever.

00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:07.704
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation
had shut down your memory inbox,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.704
and any new incoming files --
they were just being bounced.

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:15.496
You couldn't effectively
commit new experiences to memory.

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:22.538
So that's the bad that can happen
if I were to take sleep away from you,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.663
but let me just come back
to that control group for a second.

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:29.788
Do you remember those folks
that got a full eight hours of sleep?
