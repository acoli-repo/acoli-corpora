00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:32.579
what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits,

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.746
because there are real medical
and societal implications.

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:38.788
And let me just tell you about one area

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.246

out into, clinically,

00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:45.496
which is the context of aging
and dementia.

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.288
Because it's of course no secret

is that a physiological signature of aging
is that your sleep gets worse,
