00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:33.037
as a probable carcinogen,

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:35.704
because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms.

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:40.537
So you may have heard of that old maxim

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:42.704
that you can sleep when you're dead.

00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:44.787
Well, I'm being quite serious now --

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.412
it is mortally unwise advice.

00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:53.412
We know this from epidemiological studies
across millions of individuals.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.412
There's a simple truth:

00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:58.829
the shorter your sleep,
the shorter your life.

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.412
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.
