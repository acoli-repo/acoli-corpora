00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:00.288
these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.079
that we call sleep spindles.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.496
And it's the combined quality
of these deep-sleep brainwaves

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:11.954
that acts like a file-transfer
mechanism at night,

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:16.079
shifting memories from a short-term
vulnerable reservoir

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:20.413
to a more permanent long-term
storage site within the brain,

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.829
and therefore protecting them,
making them safe.

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.496
And it is important that we understand

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:32.579
what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits,
