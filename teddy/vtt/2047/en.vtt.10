somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And so even if we make

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that there are more Georges living in Georgia

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and there are more Dennises becoming dentists

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now I, of course, thought,

"Well this is American data,"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.
