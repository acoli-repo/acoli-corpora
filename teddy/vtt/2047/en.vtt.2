We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It was a little bit too funky,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we wanted a more feminine point of view

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and employed a duck

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who did it in a much more fitting way --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
fashion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
My studio in Bali

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and monkeys, of course,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to lay out them properly.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You can see,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.
