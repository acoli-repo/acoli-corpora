00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and you have meaningful friendships,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that does make a lot of difference.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
than if you are single.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
came up with this beautiful little analogy

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000

He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
on this giant elephant, the unconscious.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And the rider thinks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that he can tell the elephant what to do,
