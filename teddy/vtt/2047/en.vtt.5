00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
on your overall well-being.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Black people are just as happy as white people are.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If you're old or young

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000

it doesn't really matter.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now this does matter.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So now the woman on the right

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is actually much happier than the guy on the left --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,
