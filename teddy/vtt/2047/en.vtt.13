00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's a book on culture,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and, as you can see,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
culture is rapidly drifting around.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Doing things like I'm doing right now --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
traveling to Cannes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The example I have here

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
not being stuck behind

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
a single computer screen all day long

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and be here and there.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Quite consciously, design projects

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that need an incredible amount of various techniques,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
just basically to fight
