00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in ways that we are not quite aware of.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
If you look at the statistics

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and you see that the guy called George,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
when he decides on where he wants to live --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is it Florida or North Dakota? --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
he goes and lives in Georgia.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And if you look at a guy called Dennis,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when he decides what to become --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or a teacher? --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And if Paula decides

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
should she marry Joe or Jack,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.
