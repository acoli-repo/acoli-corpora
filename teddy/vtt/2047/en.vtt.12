00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and see what makes me happy as a designer,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the easiest answer, of course,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is do more of the stuff that I like to do

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000

One of them is to think without pressure.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is a project we're working on right now

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
with a very healthy deadline.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's a book on culture,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and, as you can see,
