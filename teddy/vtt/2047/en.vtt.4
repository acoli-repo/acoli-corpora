00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that men and women

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
report very, very similar levels of happiness.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is a very quick overview

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of all the studies that I looked at.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That climate plays no role.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That if you live in the best climate,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in San Diego in the United States,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you are going to be just as happy

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in either place.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
any salary increase you're going to experience

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
on your overall well-being.
