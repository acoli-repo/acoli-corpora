00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.235
Type is something we consume

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.157
in enormous quantities.

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:05.239
In much of the world,

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.107
it's completely inescapable.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.130
But few consumers are concerned to know

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.462
where a particular typeface came from

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.226
or when or who designed it,

00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:18.579
if, indeed, there was any human agency involved

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.376
in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:25.088
out of the software ether.

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:28.613
But I do have to be concerned with those things.

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:30.130
It's my job.
