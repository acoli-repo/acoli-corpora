00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:30.831
winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia,

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:33.336
started as a simple network of dirt roads

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.029
and blossomed into the centerpiece

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.051
of the winning North Vietnamese strategy

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:38.452
during the Vietnam War,

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:39.480
supplying weapons,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.348
troops,

00:00:40.348 --> 00:00:42.464
and psychological support to the South.

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:43.753
The trail was a network of tracks,

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:44.430
dirt roads,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.578
and river crossings

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.668
that threaded west out of North Vietnam

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:50.504
and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:51.959
between Vietnam and Laos.

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.421
The journey to the South originally took six months.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.207
But, with engineering and ingenuity,

00:00:56.207 --> 00:00:59.039
the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.294
Towards the end of war,
