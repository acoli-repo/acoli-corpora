00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.294
Towards the end of war,

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.295
as the main roads detoured through Laos,

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.923
it only took one week.

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:05.091
Here is how it happened.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.258
In 1959, as relations deteriorated

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:10.242
between the North and the South,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:13.272
a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:17.164
soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam.

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.186
The first troops moved in single-file

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:21.838
along routes used by local ethnic groups,

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.233
and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.856
were often all that indicated the direction.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.323
Initially, most of the Communist cadres

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:30.283
who came down the trail
