00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.395
Meals were invariably just rice and salt,

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:01.939
and it was easy to run out.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.152
Fear, boredom, and homesickness

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:05.318
were the dominant emotions.

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.278
And soldiers occupied their spare time

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:08.295
by writing letters,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.399
drawing sketches,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.962
and drinking and smoking with local villagers.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:13.291
The first troops down the trail

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:14.959
did not engage in much fighting.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.061
And after an exhausting six month trip,

00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.314
arriving in the South was a real highlight,

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:21.790
often celebrated by bursting into song.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.088
By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck.

00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:27.666
Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.478
took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing
