00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:30.283
who came down the trail

00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:33.307
were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam.

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:34.752
They dressed like civilian peasants

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:37.230
in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.090
They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.501
cut from truck tires,

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.378
and carried their ration of cooked rice

00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:44.123
in elephants' intestines,

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.173
a linen tube hung around the body.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:47.313
The conditions were harsh

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.298
and many deaths were caused by exposure,

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.345
malaria,

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:51.907
and amoebic dysentery.

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:52.605
Getting lost,

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:53.816
starving to death,

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:56.852
and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.227
were constant threats.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.395
Meals were invariably just rice and salt,
