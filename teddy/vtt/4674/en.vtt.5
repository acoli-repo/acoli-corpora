00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.478
took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:34.430
and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.360
As traffic down the trail increased,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.774
so did the U.S. bombing.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.733
They drove at night or in the early morning

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.223
to avoid air strikes,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:42.311
and watchmen were ready

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.318
to warn drivers of enemy aircraft.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:46.692
Villages along the trail organized teams

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:48.026
to guarantee traffic flow

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:51.111
and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks.

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.324
Their catch cries were,

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.145
"Everything for our Southern brothers!"

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.543
and, "We will not worry about our houses

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.749
if the vehicles have not yet gotten through."

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.291
Some families donated their doors
