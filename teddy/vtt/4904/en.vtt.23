00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:32.399
Google counts how often they do it,
but no one knows who has done it.

00:11:32.423 --> 00:11:36.137
And all three of them have shown a decline
just since the early 2000s.

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:38.193
And if anything, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz,

00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:42.704
who pioneered this kind
of social science by Google search,

00:11:42.728 --> 00:11:47.095
told me that, in fact, the decline
is probably even more dramatic than that,

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:48.880
because in the early days of Google,

00:11:48.904 --> 00:11:52.556
it was more tech-savvy,
educated people who used Google.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.841
Google has become hugely democratized,

00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:59.280
and so the sample now includes
the kind of demographics who, if anything,

00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:01.406
would be more likely
to be racist and sexist.
