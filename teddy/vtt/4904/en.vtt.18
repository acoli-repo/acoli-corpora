CA: So, Steve, I ask you this:
Are you trying to sell us something?

00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:03.774
(Laughter)

00:09:04.872 --> 00:09:09.586
SP: A lot of people, when they hear a talk
of the kind that I gave the other day

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.680
or read the book or read essays, say,

00:09:11.704 --> 00:09:14.260
"Oh, it's so nice to see
someone who's optimistic."

00:09:14.284 --> 00:09:16.959
But that isn't really
what I'm trying to do,

00:09:16.983 --> 00:09:22.166
because it's not seeing
the glass half full or being optimistic

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.744
to say that global poverty has declined
from 90 percent to 10 percent.

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:27.244
That's a fact.

00:09:27.268 --> 00:09:29.601
And it's a fact
that people aren't aware of.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:32.418
If you ask people, "Has global
poverty gone up or down?"
