00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:30.798
such as the gradual conquest
of extreme poverty.

Occasionally, there will be
a dramatic event

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:35.839
when it comes to
an advance in public health,

00:04:35.863 --> 00:04:38.323
such as the eradication of smallpox.

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:42.363
But more often, it's a few percentage
points a year which get compounded,

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:46.649
and so there's never a Thursday in October
in which it's actually news.

00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:49.818
CA: There's no tradition in journalism of,

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:54.082
every time you run a fact about something,
of giving some kind of context,

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:57.489
that says, by the way, here's
the long-term trend here.

00:04:57.513 --> 00:05:00.736
And so what happens is,
people just see fact, fact, fact, fact.
