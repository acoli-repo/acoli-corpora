2016 was called the "worst year ever" --

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.393
(Laughter)

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.856
until 2017 claimed that record --

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.979
(Laughter)

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.524
and left many people longing
for earlier decades,

00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:12.347
when the world seemed safer,
cleaner and more equal.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.686
CA: Steve Pinker thinks those fond
memories are actually misguided,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.171
and the world actually is getting better.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.291
But many people struggle to accept that,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:26.472
and it's certainly hard to imagine
a more consequential question.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:32.647
So whether you leave this discussion
feeling hopeful or depressed may hang on
