00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:00.208
However, an interesting example
of that asymmetry

00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:04.896
is in stories set in the future,
which are almost always dystopian.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.491
And it's very hard to conceive
of a future-situated narrative

00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.151
where things are actually better.

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:15.410
I mean, there's "The Jetsons,"
but that was kind of camp and ironic.

00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:17.848
But otherwise, we have "1984"
and "Brave New World"

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.100
and "Blade Runner."

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.156
CA: Actually, Neil Gaiman is with us,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.077
and I asked him a couple years back

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:27.093
to try and curate some new
sci-fi stories of the future

00:08:27.117 --> 00:08:30.633
that would include
a sort of hopeful future.
