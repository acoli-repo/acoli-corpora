CA: But then how worried should we be
just in the last few years

00:15:32.946 --> 00:15:38.188
that the internet has facilitated
some sort of, you know,

00:15:38.212 --> 00:15:41.759
fracturing of communities
into different bubbles of opinion?

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:46.004
Is there a risk that that trend
could get undone by this?

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:49.535
SP: Well, it is something that I think
we're all naturally concerned with,

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:53.313
both the rise of authoritarian populism

00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:57.275
and possibly the contribution
of social media in fostering it,

00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:59.096
although I think some of these trends

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.960
really may have more to do
with talk radio and cable news
