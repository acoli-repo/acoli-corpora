SP: Certainly not false.

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:03.974
The wars that take place
really do take place,

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:07.744
and the terrorist attacks
and the pollution and the poverty.

00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:12.958
But there's a basic fallacy
that we're vulnerable to

00:03:12.982 --> 00:03:14.347
when we read the news.

00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:17.021
Because the news tells us
about all of the worst things

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.708
happening in the world at any given time,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:23.339
we're apt to take that as a snapshot
of the world as a whole.

00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:27.209
And, since it's a quirk of human memory
that we tend to forget

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.236
how bad things were in the past,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.018
but we're reminded of how bad
they are in the present,
