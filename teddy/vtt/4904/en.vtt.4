00:01:55.881 --> 00:02:01.033
I don't see a more important conversation

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:02.954
or more important thing to figure out,

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:05.367
because what we believe about progress

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.878
will impact what we pay attention to.

00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:11.194
If we believe that certain things
are heading in the wrong direction,

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:12.757
that's what we pay attention to.

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.733
If that was actually an illusion,
then that's a terrible fact,

00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:17.788
we're paying attention
to the wrong things.

00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:19.149
And then, more than that,

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:22.617
what we feel about progress
is a kind of soundtrack to our lives,

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.752
it affects how we feel,
whether we're joyful or miserable,

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.906
whether we make our kids
joyful or miserable.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.405
So to me, there's just not
a more important conversation.
