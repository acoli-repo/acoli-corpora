really may have more to do
with talk radio and cable news

00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:03.537
than with social media.

00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:07.164
But even the terms of the debate,
what's even being discussed,

00:16:07.188 --> 00:16:10.569
even in the most regressive government
that we've had in years,

00:16:10.593 --> 00:16:14.268
there isn't discussion
of return to segregation,

00:16:14.292 --> 00:16:17.867
which there was in 1968,
when George Wallace won five states

00:16:17.891 --> 00:16:20.316
and 13 percent of the vote
in the United States.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.547
Wallace, the former governor of Alabama,
who then ran for president

00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:26.863
and said, "Segregation now,
segregation forever."

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:30.268
Not even the alt-right is saying
"Segregation now, segregation forever,"
