00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.405
So to me, there's just not
a more important conversation.

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.476
And Steve, if I can paraphrase your talk,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.980
you basically said
that the impression we all have

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.823
is that the world is getting worse,

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:49.220
but actually, that's an illusion,
when you actually look at the data.

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:51.918
And so let's start
with the first part of that:

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.518
the impression of the world
is that it's getting worse.

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:57.656
Are you saying that, basically,
what we read in the media,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.685
that those things are basically false?
