00:06:57.847 --> 00:07:00.473
So it goes down, down,
a couple of years it goes up.

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:04.149
Then if you report only the upticks
because it's news,

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:09.418
for the first time in 15 years,
the car accident rate got worse,

00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:12.434
and you do it 10 years later
when it got worse again,

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:15.268
you have nothing but stories
about something getting worse,

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:18.081
whereas, in fact, the overwhelming
trend is it gets better.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:21.847
But since it's not news if the same thing
happens year after year,

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.839
the impression that a news reader can get

00:07:23.863 --> 00:07:26.048
can be completely
out of whack with reality.

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:29.474
CA: So isn't there something else?

00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:34.252
Creativity seems to emerge
much better from a dark place
