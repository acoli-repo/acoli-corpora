Chris Anderson: Hello,
welcome to the TED Interview.

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:08.656
I'm Chris Anderson.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.313
And this is the podcast series where
I get to sit down with a TED speaker

00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:18.589
and dive much deeper into their ideas
than was possible during their TED Talk.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:23.283
Now, today's episode was recorded
live at the TED conference.

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:26.755
Our guest is Harvard professor
Steven Pinker.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:28.514
You could make the case

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:32.482
that Steve Pinker is one of the world's
most influential minds.
