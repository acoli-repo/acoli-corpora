00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.018
but we're reminded of how bad
they are in the present,

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.445
we have an illusion of decline,
whether or not there is one.

00:03:35.828 --> 00:03:37.939
It's even the basic mathematical point

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:41.545
that you can't interpret a trend
from one data point.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.278
So if there's a war going on now,

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:45.467
it doesn't mean that things
have gotten worse.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.183
I mean, maybe they've gotten worse,

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:49.731
but until you count
the number of wars in the past,

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.397
you don't know one way or another.

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:52.985
CA: So it's such a bizarre thing

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.532
that journalists are maybe doing
their job perfectly,

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:57.206
but if the question they're asking

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.428
is, "What is the most dramatic thing
that happened in the last day?"
