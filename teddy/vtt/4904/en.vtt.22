that maybe the only thing that's declined
is the social acceptability

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.409
of racist and sexist opinions,

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:08.846
and people are savvy enough to know
that they'd be committing a faux pas

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.903
if they gave a racist answer.

00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:14.355
But there are a number of more
unobtrusive measures that confirm that.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:17.117
I did one of them
just going to Google Trends

00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:20.704
and seeing the percentage of people
who search for racist jokes

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:23.315
or sexist jokes or homophobic jokes.

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.291
People do that in the privacy
of their own keyboard.

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:28.942
No one knows that they're doing it.

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:32.399
Google counts how often they do it,
but no one knows who has done it.
