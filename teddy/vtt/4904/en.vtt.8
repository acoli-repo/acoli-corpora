00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.428
is, "What is the most dramatic thing
that happened in the last day?"

00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:04.176
that actually could lead
to a terrible unintended consequence.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.719
You've basically said that bad things
happen more quickly than good things.

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:11.425
SP: Yeah, it's easy to destroy
something very quickly,

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.964
but good things aren't built in a day.

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:16.065
And so the timescale of news --

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.428
formerly once a day,
now, I guess, once a minute --

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:24.022
matches the timescale
of destroying things,

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.823
but not the timescale of improving things,

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:30.798
such as the gradual conquest
of extreme poverty.
