00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
From all outward appearances,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
John had everything going for him.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He had just signed the contract

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to sell his New York apartment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at a six-figure profit,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and he'd only owned it for five years.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The school where he graduated from with his master's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
had just offered him a teaching appointment,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which meant not only a salary,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but benefits for the first time in ages.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And yet, despite everything going really well for John,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
he was struggling,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
fighting addiction and a gripping depression.
