00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:32.372
My mother was a four-year-old Jew
living in London at the outset of the war.

00:13:32.396 --> 00:13:35.501
If we had not won the footrace
towards splitting the atom,

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.213
would she have survived?

00:13:37.237 --> 00:13:38.400
It's unlikely.

00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:40.161
Twenty-five years later,

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:44.618
the most impressive accomplishment,
arguably, ever in all of humankind:

00:13:44.642 --> 00:13:45.794
put a man on the moon.

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:49.442
Four hundred thirty thousand Canadians,
British and Americans came together,

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:51.297
again, with very basic technology,

00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:52.639
and put a man on the moon.

00:13:52.663 --> 00:13:56.270
Now we have the 700,000
best and brightest,

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:59.739
and these are the best and brightest
from the four corners of the earth.

00:13:59.763 --> 00:14:03.843
They are literally playing with lasers
relative to slingshots,
