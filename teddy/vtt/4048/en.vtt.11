00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.509
At the end of the Great Recession,

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.395
the market capitalization
of these companies was equivalent

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.572
to the GDP of Niger.

00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:37.220
Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India,

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:40.599
having blown past
Russia and Canada in '13 and '14.

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:41.982
There are only five nations

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:45.525
that have a GDP greater
than the combined market capitalization

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.266
of these four firms.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.428
Something is happening, though.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:54.317
The conversation just a year ago
was, which CEO was more Jesus-like?

00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.755
Who was running for president?

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.220
Now the worm has turned.

00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:00.462
Everything they're doing is bothering us.
