Our brain is robust enough to ask
these really difficult questions,

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:34.222
but, unfortunately, it doesn't have
the processing power to answer them,

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:36.544
which creates a need for a superbeing

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:38.997
that we can pray to
and look to for answers.

00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:40.306
What is prayer?

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.608
Sending a query into the universe,

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:45.404
and hopefully there's some sort
of divine intervention --

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:47.760
we don't need to understand
what's going on --

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:49.940
from an all-knowing, all-seeing superbeing

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:53.772
that gives us authority
that this is the right answer.

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:56.509
"Will my kid be all right?"

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.177
You have your planet of stuff,

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.852
you have your planet of work,

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:01.681
you have your planet of friends.
