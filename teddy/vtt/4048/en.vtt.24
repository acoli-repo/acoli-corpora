they'd never made
an acquisition over a billion,

00:12:00.704 --> 00:12:02.822
and people asked, "How did you know this?"

00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:06.065
So I'm letting this very impressive
audience in on the secret.

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:07.284
How did I know this?

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:09.278
I'm going to tell you how I knew.

00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.052
I bark at Alexa all day long

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:13.988
and try to figure out what's going on.

(Scott Galloway) Alexa, buy whole milk.

00:12:17.432 --> 00:12:19.699
(Alexa) I couldn't find

00:12:19.723 --> 00:12:21.966
so I've added whole milk
to your shopping list.

00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:23.749
SG: Then I asked,

00:12:23.773 --> 00:12:26.915
(SG) Alexa, buy organic foods.

00:12:26.939 --> 00:12:29.082
(Alexa) The top search result
for organic food

00:12:29.106 --> 00:12:32.079
is Plum Organics baby food,
banana and pumpkin,
