Everything they're doing is bothering us.

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:02.446
We're worried they're tax avoiders.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.853
Walmart, since the Great Recession,
has paid 64 billion dollars

00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:07.410
in corporate income tax;

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.433
Amazon has paid 1.4.

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:13.370

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.817
This is despite that fact --

00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:26.916
(Laughter)

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.856
This is despite the fact

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:33.675
that Amazon has added the entire
market capitalization of Walmart
