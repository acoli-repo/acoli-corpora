We are telling these companies,
"The smart thing to do,

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:35.561
the shareholder-driven thing to do,

00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:37.900
is to lie and to cheat."

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:41.572
We are issuing 25-cent parking tickets

00:07:41.596 --> 00:07:44.823
on a meter that costs 100 dollars an hour.

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:45.927
The smart thing to do is lie.

00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:47.477

00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:56.682

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:57.967
This is nothing unusual;

00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.303
