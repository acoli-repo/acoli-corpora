It's the strategy of China,

00:03:30.702 --> 00:03:32.320
it's a the strategy of Walmart,

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:35.729
and now it's the strategy of the most
successful company in the world,

00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:36.913
Amazon.

00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:39.081
You get more for less into your gut;

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:42.887
digest, send it to your muscular
and skeletal system of consumption.

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.566
Moving further,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.195
once we know we will survive,
the basic instinct,

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.661
we move to the second
most powerful instinct,

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:55.402
and that is to spread and select
the strongest, smartest and fastest seed

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:57.149
to the four corners of the earth,

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:59.513
or pick the best seed.

00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:01.261
This is not a timepiece.
