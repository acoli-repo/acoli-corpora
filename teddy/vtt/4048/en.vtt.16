00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.303
this has happened all through our economy,

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:02.589
we've just never seen
companies this good at it.

00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:04.891
That's one Yankee Stadium of workers.

00:08:04.915 --> 00:08:06.282
It's even worse in media.

00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:08.416
If Facebook and Google
grow their businesses

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.615
22 billion dollars this year,
which they will,

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.270
we're going to lose approximately
150,000 creative directors,

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.267
planners and copywriters.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.601
Or we can fill up two-and-a-half
Yankee Stadiums

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:22.016
and say, "You are out of work,
courtesy of Amazon."

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.290
We now get the majority of our news
from our social media feeds,

00:08:25.314 --> 00:08:29.587
and the majority of our news
coming off of social media feeds is ...

00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:30.911
fake news.
