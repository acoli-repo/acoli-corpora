00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:30.680
Don't smoke, don't be obese,
and prescreen --

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:33.659
get rid of about two-thirds
of early cancers

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.188
and cardiovascular disease.

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:38.776
The number one indicator or signal
that you'll make it to triple digits:

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.938
How many people do you love?

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:45.527
Caretaking is the security camera --

00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:48.471
we call the low-resolution
security camera in our brain --

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.679
deciding whether or not
you are adding value.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:54.340
Facebook taps into our instinctive need
not only to be loved,

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:55.567
but to love others,

00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:57.668
mostly through pictures
that create empathy,

00:02:57.692 --> 00:03:00.200
catalyze and reinforce our relationships.
