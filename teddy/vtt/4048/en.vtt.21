If I am suspected of a DUI
on the way home,

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:35.799
I can have blood taken from my person.

00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:39.622
But wait! Don't tap into the iPhone --

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:41.066
it's sacred.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.529
This is our new cross.

00:10:42.553 --> 00:10:44.162
It shouldn't be the iPhone X,

00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:46.182
it should be called the "iPhone Cross."

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:48.372
We have our religion; it's Apple.

00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:50.171
Our Jesus Christ is Steve Jobs,

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:53.481
and we've decided this is holier
than our person, our house

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:54.805
or our computer.

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:57.346
We have become totally out of control

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.163
with the gross idolatry
of innovation and of youth.
