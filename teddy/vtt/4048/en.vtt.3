00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:30.864
that one in six questions
posed to that person

00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:32.639
have never been asked before?

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:35.929
Google is our modern man's God.

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:40.257
Imagine your face and your name
above everything you've put into that box,

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.401
and you're going to realize
you trust Google more than any entity

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:45.639
in your history.

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:46.730
(Laughter)

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:48.513
Let's move further down the torso.

00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:50.536
(Laughter)

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.035
One of the other wonderful things
about our species

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:56.553
is we not only need to be loved,
but we need to love others.

00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:59.535
Children with poor nutrition
but a lot of affection

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:04.147
have better outcomes than children
with good nutrition and poor affection.
