My search is always to find ways to chronicle,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but that are never sentimental,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that never look away from the darkest things about us.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
than when we're most ugly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria
