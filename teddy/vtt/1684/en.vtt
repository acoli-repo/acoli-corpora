00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:06.257
(Aquatic noises)

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.714
So this video was taken

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:13.146
at Aquarius undersea laboratory

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.999
four miles off the coast of Key Largo,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.577
about 60 feet below the surface.

00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:19.301
NASA uses this extreme environment

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.725
to train astronauts and aquanauts,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:25.087
and last year, they invited us along for the ride.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.971
All the footage was taken from our open ROV,

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:32.458
which is a robot that we built in our garage.
