to two educated professionals,
two engineers -- my parents.

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.697
Upwardly mobile, you know,
upper-middle-class family,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.722
educated across the board.

00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:13.071
My mom was one of 10,000
students who was a woman

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:18.264
in the class of aeronautical engineering
at University of Cairo.

00:05:18.288 --> 00:05:20.884
So she was a trailblazer,

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:25.259
you know, broke a lot
of glass ceilings in the '60s.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:28.025
CA: The only one out of 10,000?

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:31.961
DM: The only woman at that time
in aeronautical engineering.
