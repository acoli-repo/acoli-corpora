and it was my framework
for understanding the world.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.950
And I remember stumbling on a book
in my school library

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:41.282
when I was 15 years old.

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:46.500
And to my surprise,
I learned that my faith,

00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:51.650
which I always held as important
and a part of me,

00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:55.114
and my deep passion for social justice

00:06:55.138 --> 00:06:56.671
were actually integrated.

00:06:56.695 --> 00:07:03.198
They were very related in the history
of the country that I was in.
