00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:30.376
There are issues around sexual
harassment and sexual assault

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.582
in the Muslim community,

00:16:31.606 --> 00:16:36.125
so it doesn't protect you
entirely from this issue,

00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:37.687
or at all, sometimes.

00:16:37.711 --> 00:16:42.447
So I want to emphasize
that this is a human problem.

00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.709
This is a universal, human problem.

00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:49.652
Where hijab or modest dress comes in

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:56.670
is much more in how it makes
women feel about themselves,

00:16:56.694 --> 00:17:01.479
rather than, in my mind,
limiting men's transgressions.
