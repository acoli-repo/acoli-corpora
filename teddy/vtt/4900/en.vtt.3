Of course, Islam is often criticized
for the actions taken in its name.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.823
So my goal with this conversation
is to understand Islam better,

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:44.545
while at the same time,
not shying away from hard questions.

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:48.999
And so, Dalia, I'm delighted
to have you here today.

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.660
That really was a remarkable
talk you gave.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.684
I guess it's so tempting
to categorize people we don't know.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.050
In that talk, you helped us know you.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.547
What was the reaction to the talk?
