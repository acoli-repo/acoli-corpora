00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:02.172
DM: Yeah --

00:11:02.196 --> 00:11:04.869
CA: I mean, this isn't
about feminism, it's about Islam.

00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:09.467
But that seems such a paradoxical
thing for so many people.

00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:10.806
Talk a bit more about this.

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:13.820
DM: I guess I'll take a step back

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:19.608
and just say that
in that process of submission,

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:24.792
I decided consciously to put
my conscience over conformity,

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:28.605
to break that kind of threshold of fear

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:33.160
and make a statement that was
declaring that independence.
