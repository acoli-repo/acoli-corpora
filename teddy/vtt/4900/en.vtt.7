So I thought it was
a great opportunity to build a bridge,

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:41.375
to reveal a little bit more
about the humanity of ordinary people,

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:42.551
of Muslims.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:45.989
And it was really important to me
at the end of the talk

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:50.616
to make sure that no one thought
I was an exception,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.503
that no one could sort of
dismiss my experience

00:03:53.527 --> 00:03:59.033
as just that one person,
as the exception to all others.

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.612
I really do believe that I am
entirely ordinary,
