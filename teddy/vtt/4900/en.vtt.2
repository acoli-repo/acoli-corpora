Dalia Mogahed (from TED2016): 
What do you think when you look at me?

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:05.476
A woman of faith? An expert?

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.352
Maybe even a sister.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:13.676
Or -- oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.961
If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:20.446
That's just how the media has been
portraying people who look like me.

00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:23.616
CA: It was certainly
an incredibly disarming talk.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.703
She got a big standing ovation

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:29.763
and changed, I think, how a lot of people
thought about Muslims.
