And I've gotten these messages
from all over the world since the talk.

00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:08.546
I remember one I got from Jerusalem.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.924
A Jewish Israeli wrote me

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:15.568
and said that she related so much
to the ideas of the talk,

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.970
and how oftentimes her father,
who's an Orthodox Jew,

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.975
is mistaken for a Muslim
when he's traveling in Europe,

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.692
and he himself, ironically,
has suffered from Islamophobia.

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:35.774
So I thought it was
a great opportunity to build a bridge,
