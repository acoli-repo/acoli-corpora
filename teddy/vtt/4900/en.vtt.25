00:12:27.111 --> 00:12:31.360
Now, that is a legitimate opinion
within the diversity

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:33.365
of Islamic scholarship,

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:37.096
but it is not held by
the majority of scholars.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.986
There are also modern scholars,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.133
or, I would say, more modern academics,

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:45.893
who read the Quran and say that it doesn't
require women to cover their hair at all.

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:49.147
And so there is also that opinion
that you can find out there.

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:52.720
But I want to emphasize one thing
that I think gets lost a lot of times

00:12:52.744 --> 00:12:53.910
in this conversation,

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:58.585
which is: there is a lot
of regulation on men

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:02.499
that does not get acknowledged
or is sort of ignored.
