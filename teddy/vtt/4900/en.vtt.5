00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:32.574
I mean, I had so many people tell me
how much they learned

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:34.393
and how much they really changed.

00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:40.062
I remember one particular person
which, right after the talk,

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:42.061
actually at the conference,

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:46.440
he was there as security for one
of your guests, I'm not sure who,

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:49.956
and he said, "I think that
I was really struggling

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.500
with some of these ideas
you were talking about.

00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:56.208
I think that I was really suffering
from some Islamophobia,

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.237
but your talk completely changed my mind,

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.629
and I want to thank you."
