And it was then that I decided
to wear a hijab,

00:08:03.138 --> 00:08:08.571
when I decided to practice
the hair-covering and the modest dress

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:12.221
as a statement of identity, really.

00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:18.304
What it started out as
is almost a statement of protest,

00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:20.950
a declaration of independence

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:26.260
from what I believed was
an oppressive standard of beauty

00:08:26.284 --> 00:08:27.840
that was imposed on women.

00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:31.067
And I wanted to say no to that.
