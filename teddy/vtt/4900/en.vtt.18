and why it, for me, felt very empowering,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:07.301
without first explaining
the core belief of Islam,

00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:12.150
what really drew me to it
as such a path of human liberation.

00:09:12.174 --> 00:09:16.292
And it was the idea of the oneness of God.

00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:22.629
A lot of people explain the oneness of God
in ways that I think are very esoteric.

00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:28.663
For me, it was the idea that nothing
is worthy of worship except God,

00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:34.714
meaning that I was not going to submit
to anything less than God.
