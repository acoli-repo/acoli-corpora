When 9/11 happened, Dalia threw herself
into a research project with Gallup,

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.552
in which 50,000 Muslims
were interviewed around the world

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:38.989
about their lives, their dreams,

00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:40.854
the current state of their religion.

00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:44.614
That research became a book
called "Who Speaks for Islam?"

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.088
And then in 2016, Dalia gave her TED Talk,

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:52.519
called "What it's like to be
a Muslim in America."

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:57.232
The talk was an attempt
to diffuse the Islamophobia

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.732
that is rife in so many
parts of the world.
