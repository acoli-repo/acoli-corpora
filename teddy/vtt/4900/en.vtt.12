00:05:56.746 --> 00:06:01.579
And it was in this small college town

00:06:01.603 --> 00:06:05.389
that I really formed my ideals.

00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:07.842
For anyone who doesn't know
anything about Madison,

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:12.802
it's a very deeply progressive town.

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:15.930
It's sort of your typical
liberal college town

00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:17.569
but even a little bit more.

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:20.478
I mean, it's known as
the "Berkeley of the Midwest."

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:26.011
And I was steeped into
this culture of social justice.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:29.747
I came of age in this culture,

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.806
and it was my framework
for understanding the world.
