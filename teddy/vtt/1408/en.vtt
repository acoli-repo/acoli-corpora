00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I wanted to be a rock star.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This was in the late '80s.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They wouldn't have me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I was certain that's what my life would be.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when I was 18,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was stunned to find

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that there was not a Pop Star 101,
