00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:33.079
there's the inside of the national
boundaries, inside the nation,

00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:37.234
which is where we live, work
and mind our own business.

00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:40.841
And then there's the outside;
there's everywhere else.

00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:45.459
According to this worldview,
when immigrants cross into the nation,

00:09:45.483 --> 00:09:48.449
they're moving from
the outside to the inside,

00:09:48.473 --> 00:09:50.534
but they remain outsiders.

00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:55.313
Any power or resources they receive

00:09:55.337 --> 00:09:58.744
are gifts from us rather than rights.

00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:04.212
Now, it's not hard to see why
this is such a commonly held worldview.
