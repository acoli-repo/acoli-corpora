00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:02.458
are always there to be
deepened and exploited.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.493
And that potentially
gives nativist approaches resonance

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:11.352
far beyond those who consider
themselves anti-immigrant,

00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:15.550
and remarkably, even among some
who consider themselves pro-immigrant.

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:20.731
So, for example,
when Immigrants Act allies

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:23.957
answer these questions
the nativists are posing,

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.318
they take them seriously.

00:05:25.342 --> 00:05:28.497
They legitimate those questions
and, to some extent,

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:31.541
the anti-immigrant assumptions
that are behind them.
