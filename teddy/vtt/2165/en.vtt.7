00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:31.812
Here, again, the nativist answer is no,

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:36.220
immigrants are permanently
different from us and inferior to us.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:41.784
And the third question is whether
immigrants are parasites.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.359
Are they dangerous to us?
And will they drain our resources?

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:50.757
Here, the nativist answer is yes and yes,

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:54.126
immigrants pose a threat
and they sap our wealth.

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.846
I would suggest that these three questions
and the nativist animus behind them

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.960
have succeeded in framing the larger
contours of the immigration debate.
