00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:03.064
to hand out neon-colored flyers,
protesting legislation

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:06.533
that was threatening to take away
immigrants' rights.

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:10.289
Our flyers were sincere,
they were well-meaning,

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:12.537
they were factually accurate ...

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.156
But I realize now, they were also
kind of a problem.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.815
Here's what they said:

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:21.342
"Don't take away immigrant rights
to public education,

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:24.090
to medical services,
to the social safety net.

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:25.661
They work hard.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.581
They pay taxes.

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:29.460
They're law-abiding.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:32.451
They use social services
less than Americans do.
