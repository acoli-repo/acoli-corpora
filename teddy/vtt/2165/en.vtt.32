00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:01.656
And in an unequal world, we're always
going to have to pay attention

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.153
to the question of who has the power
to join the conversation

00:16:05.177 --> 00:16:06.451
and who doesn't.

00:16:06.878 --> 00:16:09.315
But the borders of the immigration debate

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:10.697
can be moved.

00:16:11.098 --> 00:16:13.630
It's up to all of us to move them.

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:15.750
Thank you.

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:18.698
(Applause)
