We often hear these days
that the immigration system is broken.

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:09.600
I want to make the case today that
our immigration conversation is broken

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:13.968

we might build a better one.

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:17.634
In order to do that, I'm going
to propose some new questions

00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:19.022
about immigration,

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.252
the United States

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:21.599
and the world,

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:26.669
questions that might move the borders
of the immigration debate.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.655
I'm not going to begin with the feverish
argument that we're currently having,
