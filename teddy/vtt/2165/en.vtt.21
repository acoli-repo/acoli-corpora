particularly in parts of the American
economy that are indispensable

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:34.287
and where few Americans work,
like agriculture.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.438
Since the nation's founding,

00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:40.741
Americans have been inside
the American workforce.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.982
Of course, Americans have built up
institutions in society

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:48.731
that guarantee rights.

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:50.675
But so have immigrants.

00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:54.071
They've been there during
every major social movement,

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:56.551
like civil rights and organized labor,

00:10:56.575 --> 00:10:59.870
that have fought to expand
rights in society for everyone.
