With this new map in mind,

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:13.350
we can turn to a set of tough,
new, urgently needed questions,

00:12:13.374 --> 00:12:17.093
radically different from the ones

00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:21.424

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.774

about workers' rights,

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:28.473
about responsibility

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.266
and about equality.
