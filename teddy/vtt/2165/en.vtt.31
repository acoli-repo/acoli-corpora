00:15:30.281 --> 00:15:31.699
It's no small challenge

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:36.324
to take on and broaden the borders of us.

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:40.902
It will take wit,
inventiveness and courage.

00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:43.837
The old questions have been
with us for a long time,

00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:46.577
and they're not going
to give way on their own,

00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:48.661
and they're not going
to give way overnight.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.077
And even if we manage
to change the questions,

00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:54.043
the answers are going to be complicated,

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:57.484
and they're going to require
sacrifices and tradeoffs.

00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:01.656
And in an unequal world, we're always
going to have to pay attention
