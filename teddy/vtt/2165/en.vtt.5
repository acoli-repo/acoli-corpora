00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.437
We were playing that game
in part by envisioning

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.690
that immigrants were outsiders,

00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:36.855
rather than, as I'm hoping
to suggest in a few minutes,

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.930
people that are already,
in important ways, on the inside.

00:02:42.303 --> 00:02:45.840
It's those who are hostile
to immigrants, the nativists,

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.658
who have succeeded
in framing the immigration debate

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:50.889
around three main questions.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:56.657
First, there's the question of whether
immigrants can be useful tools.

00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:00.752
How can we use immigrants?
