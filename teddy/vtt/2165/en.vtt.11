00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:36.130
When we take these questions seriously
without even knowing it,

00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:39.975

exclusionary borders

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.180
of the immigration conversation.

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:44.625
So how did we get here?

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:48.932
How did these become the leading ways
that we talk about immigration?

which is where my history
training comes in.

00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:59.538
During the first century of the US's
status as an independent nation,

00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:03.274
it did very little to restrict
immigration at the national level.
