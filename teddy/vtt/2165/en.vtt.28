intensifying problem.

00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:11.480
Income and wealth gaps

00:14:11.504 --> 00:14:14.832
Increasingly, what determines
whether you're rich or poor,

00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:16.171
more than anything else,

00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.033
is what country you're born in,

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:21.109
which might seem great
if you're from a prosperous country.

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:25.696

a profoundly unjust distribution

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.773
of the chances for a long,
healthy, fulfilling life.
