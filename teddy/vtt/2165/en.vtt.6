00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:00.752
How can we use immigrants?

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:04.799
Will they make us richer and stronger?

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.667
The nativist answer
to this question is no,

00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:11.318
immigrants have little
or nothing to offer.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:17.201
The second question is whether
immigrants are others.

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.586
Can immigrants become more like us?

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.371
Are they capable of becoming more like us?

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.028
Are they capable of assimilating?

00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:28.795
Are they willing to assimilate?

00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:31.812
Here, again, the nativist answer is no,
