00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:31.476
is the way they tap into an everyday,
seemingly harmless sense

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.227
of national belonging

00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.916
and activate it, heighten it

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.626
and inflame it.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.181
Nativists commit themselves
to making stark distinctions

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.719
between insiders and outsiders.

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:50.180
But the distinction itself is at the heart
of the way nations define themselves.

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:54.416
The fissures between inside and outside,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.122
which often run deepest
along lines of race and religion,

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:02.458
are always there to be
deepened and exploited.
