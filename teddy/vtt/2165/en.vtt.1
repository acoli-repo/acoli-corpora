00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.655
I'm not going to begin with the feverish
argument that we're currently having,

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.189
even as the lives and well-being
of immigrants are being put at risk

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:38.969
at the US border and far beyond it.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.201
Instead, I'm going to begin
with me in graduate school

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.905
in New Jersey in the mid-1990s,
earnestly studying US history,

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.344
which is what I currently teach
as a professor at Vanderbilt University

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.120
in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.088
And when I wasn't studying,

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:55.356
sometimes to avoid
writing my dissertation,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.203
my friends and I would go into town

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:03.064
to hand out neon-colored flyers,
protesting legislation
