After World War II, and especially
from the mid-1960s until really recently,

00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:08.271
immigrants and their allies
turned the tide,

00:08:08.295 --> 00:08:11.697
overthrowing mid-20th century restriction

00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:16.317
and winning instead a new system
that prioritized family reunification,

00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.960
the admission of refugees

00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:20.838
and the admission of those
with special skills.

00:08:21.642 --> 00:08:22.812
But even then,

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:27.458
they didn't succeed in fundamentally
changing the terms of the debate,

00:08:27.482 --> 00:08:29.697
and so that framework endured,

00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:34.628
ready to be taken up again
in our own convulsive moment.
