00:08:56.955 --> 00:09:01.575
arrayed with the bright stain

lit from within.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.825
(Applause)

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:14.107
And this is the last one.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.103
"This Dark Hour"

of blue hostas unseen

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:32.953
Barefoot, careful
on the slick slate slabs,
