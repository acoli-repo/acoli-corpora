so bent on such unbending grace.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.319
(Applause)

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:43.921
Thank you.

00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:47.128
This one is called
"On Donating My Brain to Science."

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.344
(Laughter)

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:50.254
Not a problem.

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.862

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.036
Already a universal donor:
kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.282
tissue, heart, veins, whatever.
