00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:01.663
the phone shrills, the computer screen
blinks and glares awake.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.823
There is this hour:

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:08.823
poem in my head, soil in my hand:

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:10.793
unnamable fullness.

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:14.245
This hour, when blood of my blood

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:18.301
bone of bone, child grown
to manhood now --

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:23.789
stranger, intimate,
not distant but apart --

00:10:23.813 --> 00:10:27.547
lies safe, off dreaming melodies

00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.100
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.
