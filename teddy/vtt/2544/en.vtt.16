Balance, in other words,
has never been my strong point.

00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:04.272
But I digress.

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:05.511
More and more these days,

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.533
digression seems
the most direct route through

00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:10.634
from where I've lost or found myself

00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:14.349
out of place, mind, turn, time.

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:19.558

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:26.134
Take your time ushering the audience out,

00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.190
saying goodbye to the actors.

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.199
