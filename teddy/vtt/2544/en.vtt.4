00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.841
watching the future shuffle in and out,

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:05.608
watching it stoop; stare at you

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:07.594
while you try not to look.

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:09.856
Rare is an exchange:

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.023
a smile of brief, wry recognition.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.716
You are the new kid on the block.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.352
Everyone here was you once.

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:22.998
You are still learning that growing small
requires a largeness of spirit

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:25.481
you can't fit into yet:

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.454
acceptance of irritating help
from those who love you;

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:32.562
giving way and over, but not up.
