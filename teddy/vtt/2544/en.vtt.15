If you think about it, walking,
even standing, is illogical --

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:35.841
such tiny things, feet! --

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.782
(Laughter)

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:41.717
especially when one's body
is not al dente anymore.

00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.327
(Laughter)

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.851
Besides, creature of extremes and excess,

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:51.911
I've always thought Apollo
beautiful but boring,

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:53.919
and a bit of a dumb blonde.

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:57.748
Dionysians don't do balance.

00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:02.574
Balance, in other words,
has never been my strong point.
