00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.100
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:34.340
To have come to this place,

00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.455
lived to this moment:

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.594
immeasurable lightness.

00:10:39.392 --> 00:10:42.313
The density of black starts to blur umber.

00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:45.767
Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.802
then the mourning dove's elegy.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.780
Sable glimmers toward grey;

00:10:50.804 --> 00:10:53.972
objects emerge, trailing shadows;

00:10:53.996 --> 00:10:55.971
night ages toward day.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.006
The city stirs.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.858
There will be other dawns,
nights, gaudy noons.
