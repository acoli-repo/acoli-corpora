00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:32.953
Barefoot, careful
on the slick slate slabs,

00:09:32.977 --> 00:09:36.260
I need no light, I know the way,

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.163
stoop by the mint bed,

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:40.992
scoop a fistful of moist earth,

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:42.724
then grope for a chair,

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.402
spread a shawl, and sit,

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:49.184
breathing in the wet green August air.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.230
This is the small, still hour

00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:57.068
before the newspaper
lands in the vestibule like a grenade,

00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:01.663
the phone shrills, the computer screen
blinks and glares awake.
