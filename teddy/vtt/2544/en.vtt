00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:03.261
When I was only three or four,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.753
I fell in love with poetry,

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:08.888
with the rhythms
and the music of language;

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:12.555
with the power of metaphor and of imagery,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.341
poetry being the essence
of communication --

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.072
the discipline, the distillation.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.961
And all these years later,
the poems I'll read today

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:25.286
are from my just-finished
seventh book of poetry.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.326
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease.
