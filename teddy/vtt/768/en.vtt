00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:03.577
Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.627
that the vast majority of brain development

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:08.606
takes place in the first few years of life.

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.318
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.939
to look inside the living human brain

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.977
and track development across the lifespan.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.138
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:21.943
in brain imaging technology

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.886
such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:28.013
neuroscientists have started to look inside the living

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:30.432
human brain of all ages, and to track changes
