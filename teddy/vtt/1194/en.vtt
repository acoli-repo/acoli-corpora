00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Mark Zuckerberg,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the journalist was asking him,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Why is this so important?"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And Zuckerberg said,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
"A squirrel dying in your front yard

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
may be more relevant to your interests right now

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
than people dying in Africa."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I want to talk about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So when I was growing up

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in a really rural area in Maine,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the Internet meant something very different to me.
