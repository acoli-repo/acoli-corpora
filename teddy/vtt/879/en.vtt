On March 14, this year,

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.298
I posted this poster on Facebook.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.723
This is an image of me and my daughter

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.457
holding the Israeli flag.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.542
I will try to explain to you about the context of why

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.148
and when I posted.

00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:20.269
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.573
on the line at the grocery store,

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.859
and the owner and one of the clients

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.549
were talking to each other,

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:29.607
and the owner was explaining to the client

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:33.083
that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
