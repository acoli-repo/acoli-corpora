00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
that's in this book of mine

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:06.546
that I hope will resonate with
other things you've already heard,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.784
and I'll try to make
some connections myself,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.454
in case you miss them.

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.563
But I want to start with
what I call the "official dogma."

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:16.447
The official dogma of what?

00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.819
The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:22.122
And the official dogma runs like this:

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:26.815
if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.814
the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.
