00:00:01.012 --> 00:00:04.191
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:07.904
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.774
so I've never seen color,

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.297
and I don't know what color looks like,

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:15.272
because I come from a grayscale world.

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:17.932

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:19.784
flowers are always gray,

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:21.986
and television is still in black and white.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:24.279
But, since the age of 21,

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.408
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:31.384
In 2003, I started a project
