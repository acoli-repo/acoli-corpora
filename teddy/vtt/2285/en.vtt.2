And in January of 2018,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:08.101
I read an article
with some of his alleged victims.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:12.226
And one of the things
that really struck me about this article

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.059
is how scared they were.

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.768
They were really frightened,

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:20.934
they had, you know,
tape over the cameras on their phones

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.226
and on their laptops,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.101
and what they were worried about
was that he was a hacker

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.078
and he was going to hack into their stuff

00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:29.268
and he was going to ruin their lives.

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:32.476
And this had kept them silent
for a really long time.
