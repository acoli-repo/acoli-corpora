It is really common for people
in relationships to share passwords.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.851
Furthermore, people who are intimate,

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.434
who know a lot about each other,

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.476
can guess each other's security questions.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.559
Or they can look over
each other's shoulders

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:41.559
to see what code they're using
in order to lock their phones.

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.226
They frequently have
physical access to the phone,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.976
or they have physical access
to the laptop.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.976
And this gives them a lot of opportunity

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.309
to do things to people's accounts,

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:56.143
which is very dangerous.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:59.101
The good news is that we have advice

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:01.434
for people to lock down their accounts.
