WEBVTT

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:30.934
is that it's a commercially
available program,

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.476
which an abuser purchases,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.476
installs on the device
that they want to spy on,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.476
usually because they have physical access

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.809
or they can trick their target
into installing it themselves,

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.101
by saying, you know,

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:49.809
"This is a very important program
you should install on your device."

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:54.101
And then they pay the stalkerware company

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.893
for access to a portal,

00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:00.184
which gives them all
of the information from that device.
