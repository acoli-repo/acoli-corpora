And here is another one
where I managed to get 10,

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.226
10 out of 61.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.958
So this is still some very bad results.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.351
I have managed to convince
a couple of antivirus companies

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:14.518
to start marking stalkerware as malicious.

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:15.809
So that all you have to do

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.601
if you're worried about having
this stuff on your computer

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:21.684
is you download the program,

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.101
you run a scan and it tells you

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:27.768
"Hey, there's some potentially
unwanted program on your device."

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:30.101
It gives you the option of removing it,
