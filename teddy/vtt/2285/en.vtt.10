for people to lock down their accounts.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:05.434
This advice already exists,
and it comes down to this:

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:10.292
Use strong, unique passwords
for all of your accounts.

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:14.768
Use more strong, unique passwords

00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:18.018
as the answers to your security questions,

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:21.893
so that somebody who knows
the name of your childhood pet

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:23.542
can't reset your password.

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:29.018
And finally, turn on the highest level
of two-factor authentication

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:31.184
that you're comfortable using.
