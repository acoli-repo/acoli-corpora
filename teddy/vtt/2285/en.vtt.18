She has a black eye,
there is blood on her face.

00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:05.018
And I don't think that there is
really a lot of question

00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:09.934
about whose side HelloSpy is on
in this particular case.

00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.500
And who they're trying to sell
their product to.

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:20.601
It turns out that if you have stalkerware
on your computer or on your phone,

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:24.643
it can be really difficult to know
whether or not it's there.

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.226
And one of the reasons for that

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.851
is because antivirus companies

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:35.476
often don't recognize
stalkerware as malicious.
