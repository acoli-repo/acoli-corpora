00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:32.476
And this had kept them silent
for a really long time.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.583
So, I was furious.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.893
And I didn't want anyone
to ever feel that way again.

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.809
So I did what I usually do when I'm angry:

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.101
I tweeted.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.309
(Laughter)

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.768
And the thing that I tweeted

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:52.768
was that if you are a woman
who has been sexually abused by a hacker

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:56.226
and that hacker has threatened
to break into your devices,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.893
that you could contact me

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.809
and I would try to make sure

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:04.601
that your device got a full,
sort of, forensic look over.
