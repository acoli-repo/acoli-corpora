It gives you the option of removing it,

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.059
but it does not remove it automatically.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:33.601
And one of the reasons for that

00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:35.518
is because of the way that abuse works.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:38.768
Frequently, victims of abuse aren't sure

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.268
whether or not they want
to tip off their abuser

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.059
by cutting off their access.

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:49.184
Or they're worried that their abuser
is going to escalate to violence

00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:51.518
or perhaps even greater violence

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:54.083
than they've already been engaging in.

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.143
Kaspersky was one
of the very first companies

00:10:58.167 --> 00:11:01.434
that said that they were going to start
taking this seriously.
