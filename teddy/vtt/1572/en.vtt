00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:02.626
So I'm going to talk about work;

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.436
specifically, why people can't
seem to get work done at work,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.889
which is a problem we all kind of have.

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:11.076
But let's sort of start at the beginning.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.706
So, we have companies
and non-profits and charities

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.674
and all these groups that have
employees or volunteers of some sort.

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:23.904
And they expect these people
who work for them

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.610
to do great work --

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:26.976
I would hope, at least.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.715
At least good work, hopefully,
at least it's good work --

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.976
hopefully great work.
