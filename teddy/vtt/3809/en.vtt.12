00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.337
or make an arrest of someone
in their home.

00:06:00.337 --> 00:06:03.150
Fourteen times
in this first year and a half,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.450
I watched the police punch, choke,
kick, stomp on or beat young men

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.269
after they had caught them.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.665
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.209
Chuck and Tim.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.250
Chuck was 18 when we met,
a senior in high school.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.798
He was playing on the basketball team
and making C's and B's.

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:24.697
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:27.848
And Tim loved Chuck;
he followed him around a lot,

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:30.139
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.
