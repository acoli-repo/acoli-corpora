00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.060
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.809
if they were living in a neighborhood
where kids were going to college,

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.238
not prison.

00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:41.071
A neighborhood like the one 
I got to grow up in.

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.536
Okay, you might say.

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:46.288
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
they're committing crimes!

00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:48.414
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

00:09:48.414 --> 00:09:52.228
Don't they deserve to be 
living in fear of arrest?

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:55.350
Well, my answer would be no.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.430
They don't.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.457
And certainly not for the same things 
that other young people

00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:02.901
with more privilege are doing
with impunity.
