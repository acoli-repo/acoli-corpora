00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:30.130
A criminal justice system 
that acknowledges

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.110
the legacy of exclusion that poor people
of color in the U.S. have faced

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.266
and that does not promote
and perpetuate those exclusions.

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:41.651
(Applause)

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:47.853
And finally, a criminal justice system
that believes in black young people,

00:12:47.853 --> 00:12:51.717
rather than treating black young people 
as the enemy to be rounded up.

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:55.440
(Applause)

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.287
The good news is that we already are.
