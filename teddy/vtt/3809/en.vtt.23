Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that.

00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:36.505
Right now, we're asking kids who live
in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:38.786
who have the least amount
of family resources,

00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:41.347
who are attending 
the country's worst schools,

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:44.253
who are facing the toughest time
in the labor market,

00:11:44.253 --> 00:11:47.906
who are living in neighborhoods
where violence is an everyday problem,

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:52.479
we're asking these kids to walk
the thinnest possible line --

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:56.290
to basically never do anything wrong.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.791
Why are we not providing support
to young kids facing these challenges?
