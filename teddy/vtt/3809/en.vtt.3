00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.517
to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.723
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:37.206
and what kids are getting
is a cold prison cell

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:40.016
and a permanent mark against them
when they come home

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.765
and apply for work.

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:46.211
There are more and more kids
on this journey to adulthood

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:51.435
than ever before in the United States
and that's because in the past 40 years,

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:57.187
our incarceration rate 
has grown by 700 percent.

00:01:57.187 --> 00:01:59.316
I have one slide for this talk.

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.570
Here it is.
