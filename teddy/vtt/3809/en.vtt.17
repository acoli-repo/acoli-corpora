00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:31.591
and the car comes up 
as stolen in California.

00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:35.714
Chuck had no idea where in the history
of this car it had been stolen.

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:39.190
His girlfriend's uncle bought it
from a used car auction

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.657
in northeast Philly.

00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:43.485
Chuck and Tim had never been
outside of the tri-state,

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:45.834
let alone to California.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:47.932
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:51.500
charged Chuck with 
receiving stolen property.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.312
And then a juvenile judge, 
a few days later,

00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:56.464
charged Tim, age 11,

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.537
with accessory to receiving
a stolen property

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:03.190
and then he was placed on 
three years of probation.
