00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.536
Young people on this journey
are meeting with probation officers

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.939
instead of with teachers.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.832
They're going to court dates
instead of to class.

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:13.909
Their junior year abroad is instead
a trip to a state correctional facility.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.599
And they're emerging from their 20s

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.796
not with degrees in business and English,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.814
but with criminal records.

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:25.107
This institution is also costing us a lot,

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:26.749
about 40,000 dollars a year

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.517
to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey.
