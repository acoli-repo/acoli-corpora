00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.570
Here it is.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.623
Here's our incarceration rate,

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:09.915
about 716 people per 100,000
in the population.

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:14.065
Here's the OECD countries.

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.617
What's more, it's poor kids
that we're sending to prison,

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.105
too many drawn from African-American
and Latino communities

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:29.986
so that prison now stands firmly between
the young people trying to make it

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:33.418
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.
