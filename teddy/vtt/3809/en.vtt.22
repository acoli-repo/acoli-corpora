00:10:56.545 --> 00:11:00.129
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:03.569
It turns out that the crime rate
goes up and down

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:08.095
irrespective of how many young people
we send to prison.

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:12.358
We tend to think about justice
in a pretty narrow way:

00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:15.962
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:19.317
Injustice is about being 
wrongfully convicted.

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:21.632
So if you're convicted 
of something you did do,

00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:23.467
you should be punished for it.

00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.233
There are innocent and guilty people,

00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:27.670
there are victims and 
there are perpetrators.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.071
Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that.
