00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:04.971
On the path that American children 
travel to adulthood,

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.519
two institutions oversee the journey.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.262
The first is the one we hear 
a lot about: college.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.845
Some of you may remember
the excitement that you felt

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.431
when you first set off for college.

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.983
Some of you may be in college right now

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:22.998
and you're feeling this excitement
at this very moment.

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.667
College has some shortcomings.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:29.003
It's expensive; it leaves
young people in debt.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.947
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.
