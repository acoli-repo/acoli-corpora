00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.113
Then the judge on his assault case
issued him a warrant for his arrest

00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:05.388
because he couldn't pay 
the 225 dollars in court fees

00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:08.915
that came due a few weeks after
the case ended.

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:12.935
Then he was a high school dropout
living on the run.

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:14.987
Tim's first arrest came later that year

00:08:14.987 --> 00:08:16.770
after he turned 11.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.900
Chuck had managed
to get his warrant lifted

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.561
and he was on a payment plan
for the court fees

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:25.071
and he was driving Tim to school
in his girlfriend's car.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.806
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:31.591
and the car comes up 
as stolen in California.
