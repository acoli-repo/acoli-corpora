00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:33.418
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.274
The problem's actually 
a bit worse than this

00:02:36.274 --> 00:02:38.952
'cause we're not just sending 
poor kids to prison,

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:41.919
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.240
with probation and parole restrictions,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.127
with low-level warrants,

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:49.622
we're asking them to live 
in halfway houses and on house arrest,

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:53.227
and we're asking them 
to negotiate a police force

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:55.640
that is entering poor
communities of color,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.839
not for the purposes 
of promoting public safety,

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:03.315
but to make arrest counts,
to line city coffers.
