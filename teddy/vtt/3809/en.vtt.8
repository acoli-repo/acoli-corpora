who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.942
Soon, her cousin came home 
from a juvenile detention center.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:06.600
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.259
I began to get to know him 
and his friends and family,

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.611
and I asked him what he thought 
about me writing about his life

00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:16.196
for my senior thesis in college.

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:20.387
This senior thesis became
a dissertation at Princeton

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:21.935
and now a book.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.533
By the end of my sophomore year,

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:26.903
I moved into the neighborhood
and I spent the next six years

00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:31.494
trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age.
