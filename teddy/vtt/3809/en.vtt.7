00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.415
attending the University of Pennsylvania

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:32.493
in the early 2000s.

00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:36.060
Penn sits within a historic 
African-American neighborhood.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.298
So you've got these two parallel
journeys going on simultaneously:

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:44.419
the kids attending 
this elite, private university,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.885
and the kids from 
the adjacent neighborhood,

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:48.813
some of whom are making it to college,

00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:52.311
and many of whom 
are being shipped to prison.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.415
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
a young woman who was in high school

00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.409
who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university.
