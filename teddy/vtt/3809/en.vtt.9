00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:31.494
trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age.

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:34.318
The first week I spent
in this neighborhood,

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.894
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:38.386
play this game of chase,

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:41.337
where the older boy
ran after the other boy.

00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:42.532
He played the cop.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.720
When the cop caught up
to the younger boy,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.420
he pushed him down,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.971
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.282
took a quarter out of 
the other child's pocket,

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:54.874
saying, "I'm seizing that."

00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:58.214
He asked the child if 
he was carrying any drugs

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.659
or if he had a warrant.
