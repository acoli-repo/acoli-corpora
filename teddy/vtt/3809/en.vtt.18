and then he was placed on 
three years of probation.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.332
With this probation sentence 
hanging over his head,

00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:09.419
Chuck sat his little brother down

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:12.868
and began teaching him
how to run from the police.

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:15.200
They would sit side by side 
on their back porch

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.264
looking out into the shared alleyway

00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:21.104
and Chuck would coach Tim
how to spot undercover cars,

00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:26.071
how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
how and where to hide.

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:28.691
I want you to imagine for a second

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.060
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like
