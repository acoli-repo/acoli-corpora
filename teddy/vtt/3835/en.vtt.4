Human waste, in its rawest form,

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:06.400
finds its way back to drinking water,
bathing water, washing water,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.828
irrigation water, whatever water you see.

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:15.874
And this is the cause for 80 percent 
of the diseases in rural areas.

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:23.695
In India, it is unfortunately only the
women who carry water.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:27.303
So for all domestic needs,
women have to carry water.

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:33.098
So that is a pitiable state of affairs.
