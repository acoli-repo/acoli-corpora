00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:30.295
about six to seven hours 
a day carrying water.

00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:34.890
And when they went to carry water,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:40.259
because, as I said earlier,
it's only women who carry water,

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:46.834
they used to take their little children,
girl children, also to carry water,

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:51.615
or else to be back at home
to look after the siblings.

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.856
So there were less than nine percent
of girl children attending school,

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:58.207
even if there was a school.

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:01.179
And boys, about 30 percent.
