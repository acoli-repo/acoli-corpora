00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:30.979
And we came together and formed 
a project called MANTRA.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:37.836
MANTRA stands for Movement and Action
Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:44.412
So we are speaking about transformation,
transformation in rural areas.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:49.224
Villages that agree 
to implement this project,

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:52.087
they organize a legal society

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:56.453
where the general body 
consists of all members

00:03:56.453 --> 00:04:02.336
who elect a group of men and women
who implement the project
