00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.941
We feel that the poor have been
humiliated for centuries.

00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.359
And even in sanitation,

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:39.545
they should not be humiliated.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:42.239
Sanitation is more about dignity

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.907
than about human disposal of waste.

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:49.236
And so you build these toilets 
and very often,

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:55.442
we have to hear that the toilets are
better than their houses.

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:59.323
And you can see that in front are 
the attached houses

00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:02.151
and the others are the toilets.
