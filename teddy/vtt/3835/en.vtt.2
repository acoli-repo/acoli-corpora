biogas for rural kitchens.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:08.050
We produce biogas in India 
by using animal manure,

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:10.551
which usually, in India, 
is called cow dung.

00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:14.605
But as the gender-sensitive 
person that I am,

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.533
I would like to call it bullshit.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.916
But realizing later on

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:27.493
how important were sanitation
and the disposal of crap in a proper way,

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:32.051
we went into the arena of sanitation.
