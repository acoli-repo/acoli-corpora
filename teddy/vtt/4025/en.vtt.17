00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:31.350
no management is the best management.

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.284
It's a tiny jungle party.

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:35.523
(Laughter)

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:39.206
This forest grows as a collective.

00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:40.945
If the same trees --

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:42.246
same species --

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.508
would have been planted independently,

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:46.479
it wouldn't grow so fast.

00:08:46.503 --> 00:08:50.687
And this is how we create
a 100-year-old forest

00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:52.020
in just 10 years.

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:53.198
Thank you very much.

00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:58.796
