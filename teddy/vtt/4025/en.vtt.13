00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:30.158
roots reach a depth of one meter.

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:32.620
These roots form a mesh,

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:34.373
tightly holding the soil.

00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:37.993
Microbes and fungi live
throughout this network of roots.

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:42.293
So if some nutrition is not available
in the vicinity of a tree,

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:45.177
these microbes are going to get
the nutrition to the tree.

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:47.478
Whenever it rains,

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:48.662
magically,

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:50.549
mushrooms appear overnight.

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:53.778
And this means the soil below
has a healthy fungal network.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:56.930
Once these roots are established,

00:06:56.954 --> 00:06:59.119
forest starts growing on the surface.

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:04.202
As the forest grows we keep watering it --
