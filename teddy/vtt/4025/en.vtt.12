00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:01.613
On the surface, we spread
a thick layer of mulch,

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:04.205
so when it's hot outside
the soil stays moist.

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:06.317
When it's cold,

00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:09.558
frost formation happens only on the mulch,

00:06:09.582 --> 00:06:12.991
so soil can still breathe
while it's freezing outside.

00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:16.666
The soil is very soft --

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.184
so soft, that roots
can penetrate into it easily,

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:21.358
rapidly.

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:24.549
Initially, the forest doesn't
seem like it's growing,

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:26.391
but it's growing under the surface.

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:28.207
In the first three months,

00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:30.158
roots reach a depth of one meter.
