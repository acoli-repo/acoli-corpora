00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:31.323
At this stage,

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:34.544
every single drop of water
that falls into the forest

00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:36.925
doesn't evaporate back
into the atmosphere.

00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:40.415
This dense forest condenses the moist air

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:42.210
and retains its moisture.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.865
We gradually reduce and eventually
stop watering the forest.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.858
And even without watering,

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:52.928
the forest floor stays moist
and sometimes even dark.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.370
Now, when a single leaf
falls on this forest floor,

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.545
it immediately starts decaying.
