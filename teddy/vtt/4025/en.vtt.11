00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:31.422
we increase the percentage
of fruit-bearing trees.

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.612
It could be a flowering forest,

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.572
a forest that attracts
a lot of birds or bees,

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:42.085
or it could simply be a native,
wild evergreen forest.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.529
We collect the seeds
and germinate saplings out of them.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.975
We make sure that trees
belonging to the same layer

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.849
are not planted next to each other,

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.200
or they will fight for the same
vertical space when they grow tall.

00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:57.784
We plant the saplings close to each other.

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:01.613
On the surface, we spread
a thick layer of mulch,
