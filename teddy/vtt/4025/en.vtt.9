00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.947
How do we decide what's native or not?

00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:35.931
Well, whatever existed
before human intervention is native.

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:37.344
That's the simple rule.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.794
We survey a national park

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.024
to find the last remains
of a natural forest.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.690
We survey the sacred groves,

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.605
or sacred forests around old temples.

00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:55.252
And if we don't find anything at all,

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:56.800
we go to museums

00:04:56.824 --> 00:05:02.047
to see the seeds or wood of trees
existing there a long time ago.
