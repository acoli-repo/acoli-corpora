00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:04.202
As the forest grows we keep watering it --

00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:08.017
for the next two to three years,
we water the forest.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:13.808
We want to keep all the water
and soil nutrition only for our trees,

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.516
so we remove the weeds
growing on the ground.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.289
As this forest grows,
it blocks the sunlight.

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.247
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense

00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:25.505
that sunlight can't reach
the ground anymore.

00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:29.364
Weeds cannot grow now,
because they need sunlight as well.
