A forest is not an isolated piece of land
where animals live together.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:09.575
A forest can be an integral part
of our urban existence.

00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:11.546
A forest, for me,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.067
is a place so dense with trees
that you just can't walk into it.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.037
It doesn't matter
how big or small they are.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:22.429
Most of the world
we live in today was forest.

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:24.486
This was before human intervention.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.153
Then we built up our cities
on those forests,

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:28.677
like São Paulo,

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.470
forgetting that we belong
to nature as well,
