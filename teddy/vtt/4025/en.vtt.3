forgetting that we belong
to nature as well,

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:35.244
as much as 8.4 million
other species on the planet.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:39.643
Our habitat stopped being
our natural habitat.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.192
But not anymore for some of us.

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.242
A few others and I today make
these forests professionally --

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.073
anywhere and everywhere.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:51.234
I'm an industrial engineer.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:53.430
I specialize in making cars.

00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:56.254

I learned how to convert
natural resources into products.
