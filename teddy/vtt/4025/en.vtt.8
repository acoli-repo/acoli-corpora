00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.783
What if the soil doesn't have
any nutrition in it?

00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:04.709
We don't just add nutrition
directly to the soil.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.345
That would be the industrial way.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.795
It goes against nature.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.903
We instead add microorganisms to the soil.

00:04:10.927 --> 00:04:14.236
They produce the nutrients
in the soil naturally.

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:17.475
They feed on the biomass
we have mixed in the soil,

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.198
so all they have to do
is eat and multiply.

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:22.173
And as their number grows,

00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:23.745
the soil starts breathing again.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.162
It becomes alive.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.842
We survey the native
tree species of the place.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.947
How do we decide what's native or not?
