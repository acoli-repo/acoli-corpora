00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:04.568
we find that every single element
needed to make a forest

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.642
is available right around us.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.347
All we have to do is to bring
these elements together

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.332
and let nature take over.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.101
To make a forest we start with soil.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.565
We touch, feel and even taste it

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.057
to identify what properties it lacks.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.722
If the soil is made up of small particles
it becomes compact --

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.149
so compact, that water cannot seep in.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:32.636
We mix some local biomass
available around,
