00:04:56.824 --> 00:05:02.047
to see the seeds or wood of trees
existing there a long time ago.

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:08.044
We research old paintings,
poems and literature from the place,

00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:10.601
to identify the tree species
belonging there.

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:12.563
Once we know our trees,

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.505
we divide them in four different layers:

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.936
shrub layer, sub-tree layer,
tree layer and canopy layer.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:20.992
We fix the ratios of each layer,

00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:25.720
and then we decide the percentage
of each tree species in the mix.

00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:28.339
If we are making a fruit forest,

00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:31.422
we increase the percentage
of fruit-bearing trees.
