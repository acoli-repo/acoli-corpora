00:01:56.278 --> 00:02:00.346
I learned how to convert
natural resources into products.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.307
To give you an example,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.982
we would drip the sap
out of a rubber tree,

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.665
convert it into raw rubber

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.394
and make a tire out of it -- the product.

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:12.412
But these products can never
become a natural resource again.

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:16.245
We separate the elements from nature

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.505
and convert them
into an irreversible state.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.246
That's industrial production.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:25.487
Nature, on the other hand,
works in a totally opposite way.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.895
The natural system produces
by bringing elements together,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.274
atom by atom.
