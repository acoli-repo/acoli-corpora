00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:32.636
We mix some local biomass
available around,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.187
which can help soil become more porous.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.016
Water can now seep in.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.858
If the soil doesn't have
the capacity to hold water,

00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:45.557
we will mix some more biomass --

00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.855
some water-absorbent material
like peat or bagasse,

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.727
so soil can hold this water
and it stays moist.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.298
To grow, plants need water,
sunlight and nutrition.

00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.783
What if the soil doesn't have
any nutrition in it?
