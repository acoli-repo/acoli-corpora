00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.774
I wake up to this every morning,

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.297
like a Disney princess.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.718
(Laughter)

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:36.370
I am an entrepreneur

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:40.774
who facilitates the making
of these forests professionally.

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:42.722
We have helped factories,

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:43.903
farms,

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.085
schools,

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:47.442
homes,

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:49.482
resorts,

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:51.629
apartment buildings,

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.131
public parks

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.197
and even a zoo

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.730
to have one of such forests.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:03.009
A forest is not an isolated piece of land
where animals live together.
