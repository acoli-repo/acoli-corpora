Chris Anderson: Elon Musk,
great to see you.

00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:03.583
How are you?

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.001
Elon Musk: Good. How are you?

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.213
CA: We're here at the Texas Gigafactory

It's been pretty crazy out there.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.343

for making time on a busy day.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:18.056

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:29.400
