00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.796
with a meal of robust
-- if inferior -- food inside them,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.028
shuffle off to the now tepid baths

00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:48.240
before returning
to their apartment blocks.

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:54.345

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.866
A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit.
