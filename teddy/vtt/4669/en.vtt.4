00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:02.389
you can't learn in the classroom:

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.142
how to run,

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:06.832
how to swim,

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.270
and how to fight.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:13.394
Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:15.772
and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire.

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:22.008
But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child.

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:24.871
He's not trusted
to arrange business deals.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.386
His father will take care
of that until he is 25.
