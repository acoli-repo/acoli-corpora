00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.518
Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare.

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.879
Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73.

00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:10.994
There are campaigns in the north
of England and into Scotland,

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.678
to the north of the River
Danube into Romania,

00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:18.583
and on the frontier
between Syria and Iraq to the east.

00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:22.249
It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths.

00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:26.461
Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street,

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:30.396
to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous Baths of Agrippa.
