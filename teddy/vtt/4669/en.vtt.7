00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.861
Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:33.444
with their now adult children

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.664
remembering stories of Rome's glory

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:40.578
and re-telling the good deeds and sayings
of the great men of the past:

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:43.688
lessons on how to live well,

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:46.560
and to overcome the follies of youth.

00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:51.835
There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present.

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:57.806
Romans made an empire
without end in time and space.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.831
(Thump)

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.518
Rome was destined to be
eternal through warfare.
