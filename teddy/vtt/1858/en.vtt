00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.388
I'm going to start
on a slightly somber note.

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:07.423
Two thousand and seven, five years ago,

00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:10.468
my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.342
Stage IIB.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.095
Now, looking back, the most
harrowing part of that experience

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.926
was not just the hospital visits --

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.762
these were very painful
for my wife, understandably so.

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.641
It was not even the initial shock
of knowing that she had breast cancer

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:26.816
at just 39 years old,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.281
absolutely no history
of cancer in her family.
