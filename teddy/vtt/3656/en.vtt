00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.893
I study rumors.

00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:05.309
Not tabloid gossip

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.851
or the kind of rumors
that are making stock markets crash --

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.434
or soar --

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:13.351
but the kind of rumors
that affect your health ...

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:15.143
and the world's health.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.643
Like eating a lot of garlic

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:18.976
or drinking a lot of water

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
is going to help
protect us from coronavirus --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.458
if only.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.768
Rumors have a bad reputation.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.684
They're seen as not fact,

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.476
wrong,
