00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.226
what are the public thinking
and how can we engage?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.601
We look for early signals.

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:02.976
When we find one,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.809
we have a global network of collaborators
in a number of countries

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.684
who have more local
intelligence in that setting

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:11.476
to try to understand --

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.601
is this signal misinformation,

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:16.542
or is something brewing
that we should know about?

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.268
In London, we have a bigger picture.

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:23.518
We watch the swarms of rumors,
not just traveling locally

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:25.309
but jumping countries.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:29.101
We've seen them jump
from Japan over to Colombia,

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:31.143
through Europe and around.
