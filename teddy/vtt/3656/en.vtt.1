00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.476
wrong,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.083
or "just a rumor."

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.601
But I've studied rumors for years,

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:39.434
and one thing I've learned
is that they all have a story,

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:41.976
and often, an important story.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.143
One of the most moving or alarming
rumor episodes that I investigated

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.559
was in northern Nigeria.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:54.208
I was working with UNICEF's
Global Immunization programme.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:58.851
And it wasn't the rumors themselves
that I found so alarming;

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.000
it was the global impact of those rumors.
