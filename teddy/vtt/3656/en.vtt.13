00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:31.143
through Europe and around.

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:32.434
They move.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:35.934
We live in a hyperconnected environment.

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.893
One of the things
that we found fascinating,

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.226
and we've learned
a lot in the last 10 years --

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.643
this is our 10th anniversary,

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.643
this didn't start yesterday,
this rumor problem --

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.476
and one of the things we've learned

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.893
is in our global monitoring,

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:55.268
that Europe is the most
skeptical region in the world.

00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.476
France won the prize, actually.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.559
(Laughter)

00:06:58.583 --> 00:06:59.976
By far.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.250
And actually some of those rumors
have traveled to other parts of the world.
