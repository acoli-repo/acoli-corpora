00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:00.934
The highly negative --

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.559
what we might call
the antivaccine groups --

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:06.476
were recruiting the undecided

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.226
at a rate 500 percent faster

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.893
than the provaccine groups.

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:16.518
500 percent faster.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.976
They were more nimble,
they were responsive

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.684
and they were listening.

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:24.101
Most people believe that vaccines are good

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.434
and they believe in their importance.

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:29.309
But that belief is under attack.

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:33.809
We need to build in
more opportunities for conversation.
