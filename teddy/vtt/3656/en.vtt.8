00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.268
I convened anthropologists,
epidemiologists,

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:02.934
psychologists,

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.976
digital media specialists

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.351
and mathematical modelers.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.726
We set ourselves the task

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.184
to investigate historic episodes of rumors

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:17.018
and their impacts,

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:20.976
from trying to figure out
what were the early signals,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.976
what were the amplifying factors

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.601
and the impacts,

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:26.434
how did they get traction,

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:30.351
so we could start to understand
what we should be looking for,
