And actually some of those rumors
have traveled to other parts of the world.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.101
But we were trying to understand Europe.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.643
Hmm. Why Europe?

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:11.059
I thought the US was really --

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.893
had some of the most skepticism,

00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:15.351
but boy, I was wrong.

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:18.434

a colleague we work with,

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:20.059

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:24.226
he took our data
from 28 European countries

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.518
and he looked at it

00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:28.458
and correlated it
with political opinion polling.

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:30.934
And what did he find?
