00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:01.156
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:02.241
a psychiatrist,

00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:03.954
and said surely he would agree

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:06.250
that restraints must be degrading,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.786
painful and frightening.

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.897
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:12.226
"Elyn, you don't really understand:

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.964
These people are psychotic.

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:15.485
They're different from me and you.

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:18.249
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.083
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.084
no, we're not that different from him.

00:08:23.084 --> 00:08:25.442
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:27.772
and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.

00:08:27.772 --> 00:08:29.924
In fact, until very recently,

00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:31.906
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,
