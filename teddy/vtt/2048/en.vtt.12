00:05:59.848 --> 00:06:03.193
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,

00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:05.225
moaning in fear and isolation."

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.352
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.592

and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.171
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'

00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:27.138
and his whole team of goons swooped down,

00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:28.547

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:30.220
and slammed me down on a metal bed
