00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.075
'Thank you for coming, Steve.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:35.126
Crumbling world, word, voice.

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.995
Tell the clocks to stop.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:38.786
Time is. Time has come.'

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:42.027
'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:45.458
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.085
'Gravity is pulling me down.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.218
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:52.930
As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.434
on three different occasions for lengthy periods.

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:58.226
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.821
and gave me a prognosis of "grave."
