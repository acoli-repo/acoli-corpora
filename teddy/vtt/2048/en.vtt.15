00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:31.844
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.

If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:39.290
There's nothing benign about it.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.075
Every week in the United States,

While I was preparing to write my student note

for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,

00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:01.156
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also
