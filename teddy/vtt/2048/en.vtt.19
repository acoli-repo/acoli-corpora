00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:32.829
Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:35.062
covered my face, and began shaking.

00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:38.217
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:40.385
They'd slice me up in thin slices

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:42.027
or make me swallow hot coals.

00:09:42.027 --> 00:09:45.404
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:48.489
Even in this state, what he accurately described as

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:50.180
acutely and forwardly psychotic,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.193
I refused to take more medication.

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.993
The mission is not yet complete.

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:57.611
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,

00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.909
I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert

00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:02.217
who was following me for medication side effects.
