and gave me a prognosis of "grave."

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.251
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.955
and work at menial jobs.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:07.955
Fortunately, I did not actually

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.730
enact that grave prognosis.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.571
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.196
and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.826
I have many close friends

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:20.011
and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:24.538
(Applause) Thank you.

00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:29.812
He's definitely the star of my show.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:32.610
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also
