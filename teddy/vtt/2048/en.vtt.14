00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:01.219
"gravely disabled."

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.315
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.107
to do my Yale Law School homework.

00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:09.148
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.

00:07:09.148 --> 00:07:10.754
(Laughter)

00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:13.443
During the next year, I would

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:15.595
spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:19.074
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:22.564
arms tied, arms and legs tied down,

00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:25.083
arms and legs tied down with a net tied

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:26.891
tightly across my chest.

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.938
I never struck anyone.

00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:31.844
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
