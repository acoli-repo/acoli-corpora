WEBVTT

00:11:56.637 --> 00:12:00.070
has been my best and most powerful and most reliable

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.790
defense against my mental illness.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.093
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and

00:12:05.093 --> 00:12:07.009
friends, supportive work environment —

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:09.342
I did not make my illness public

00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:10.775
until relatively late in life,

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:13.294
and that's because the stigma against mental illness

00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:15.902
is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.318
If you hear nothing else today,

00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:21.752
please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:24.903
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:26.998
may be your spouse, they may be your child,

00:12:26.998 --> 00:12:29.422
they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,

00:12:29.422 --> 00:12:30.846
they may be your coworker.
