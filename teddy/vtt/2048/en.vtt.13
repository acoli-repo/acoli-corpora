00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:30.220
and slammed me down on a metal bed

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.572
with such force that I saw stars.

00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:35.130
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.797
with thick leather straps.

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:40.143
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.171
half groan, half scream,

00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.515
barely human and pure terror.

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:47.186
Then the sound came again,

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.110
forced from somewhere deep inside my belly

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.707
and scraping my throat raw."

00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:54.986
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.

00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:58.527
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me

00:06:58.527 --> 00:06:59.812
against my will was that I was

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:01.219
"gravely disabled."
