00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:02.770
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.579
I've spent hundreds of days

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:06.066
in psychiatric hospitals.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.871
I might have ended up spending

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.698

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:11.898

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:15.346
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.835
for almost three decades,

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.778
perhaps my proudest accomplishment.

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.972
That's not to say that I've remained clear

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:22.579
of all psychiatric struggles.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.004
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.010
got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.595
announced to me that he was going to close his practice
