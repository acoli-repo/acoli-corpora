00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:31.906
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:34.938
that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:37.370
I've never met a psychiatric patient

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.764

Eventually, I came to Los Angeles

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.604
For years, I had resisted medication,

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.594
making many, many efforts to get off.

00:08:59.594 --> 00:09:02.269
