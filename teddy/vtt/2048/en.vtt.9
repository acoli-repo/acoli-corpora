00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.423
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways

00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:32.946
that made no sense.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:36.010
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.530
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.985
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:43.001
Rebel and Val looked at me

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.672
as if they or I had been

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:46.252
splashed in the face with cold water.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.808
'What are you talking about, Elyn?'

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:50.817
'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,

00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:53.072
heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.

00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:54.648
It's a flat surface. It's safe.'

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.232
Rebel and Val followed

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:57.681
and they asked what had gotten into me.

00:04:57.681 --> 00:04:59.544
'This is the real me,' I announced,

00:04:59.544 --> 00:05:01.089
waving my arms above my head.
