00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:02.108
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.359
the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.936
of people with my thoughts.

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:07.641
I sometimes have the idea that

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.136
nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.472
Occasionally, I have hallucinations,

00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:14.240
like one time I turned around and saw a man

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.817
with a raised knife.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.609
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.819
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.365
to the point of incoherence.

00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:26.244
Loose associations involves putting together words

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:29.027
that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:31.417
and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."
