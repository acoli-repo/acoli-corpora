00:08:27.863 --> 00:08:30.544
sometimes the most interesting
thing about a flag

00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:32.329
is not so much its design,

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:35.955
but it's those laws around the flag.

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:37.953
For instance,

00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:41.318
in India, to create an Indian flag,

00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:44.771
you must use a hand-spun
cloth named "khadi."

00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:47.554
If you make a flag out of anything else,

00:08:47.578 --> 00:08:50.569
you could go to jail
for up to three years.

00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:52.389
It's crazy.

00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:54.254
Here in Texas,

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:56.255
we've all heard

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:59.807
that the Texas flag is the only state flag
that can fly at the same height

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.006
as the US, flag, right?
