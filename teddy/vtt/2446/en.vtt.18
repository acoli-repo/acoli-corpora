WEBVTT

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.006
as the US, flag, right?

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.434
Because we were a nation
before we were a state.

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:04.709
Who here has heard that?

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:06.376
Yeah.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.095
Well, I'm here to tell you
that is completely false. OK?

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:14.746
First of all, we were not the only state
that was a nation before joining up.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.824
And secondly, all state flags can fly
at the same height as the US flag

00:09:18.848 --> 00:09:21.015
according to the US flag code.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.292
And I don't have to ask you
how you feel about this one, right?

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:28.452
Most of us grew up pledging allegiance
to this every morning,

00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:31.649
knowing we should never
let it touch the ground, etc.
