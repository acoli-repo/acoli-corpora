00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.299
where they got to choose
between that thing

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.128

the current flag of Georgia.

00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:05.886
Now some of you might be wondering,

"Wait a second, Michael --

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:09.740
if that before wasn't
the Confederate flag,

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:12.134
what was the Confederate flag?"

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:18.482

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:19.731

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.484

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:25.663
Well, let's go back
to our emotions for a second.

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:29.726
That didn't punch you in the gut
as much as the other one did, did it?
