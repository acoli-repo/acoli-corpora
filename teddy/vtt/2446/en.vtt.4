00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.441
So this is not the Confederate flag. OK?

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.661
This is the battle flag
of the Army of Northern Virginia

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:06.665
led by General Robert E. Lee.

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:10.263
So next time someone tells you
that this is their heritage,

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:13.247
unless their family fought
for that very specific militia,

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.522
they're wrong, alright?

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:17.414
And you have a flag expert's
permission to tell them so.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.937
This flag rose into prominence
during the mid-1950s and '60s

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.758
as a response to the growing
Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:27.926
And then of course today,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.222
it has come to represent
the Confederacy to most of us.
