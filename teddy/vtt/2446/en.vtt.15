00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:30.124
And usually, that's subtle.

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:31.348
It's a byproduct.

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:33.149
It's usually not the intent.

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.699
But the Germans were very clear
as to who was represented by the swastika

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.053
and who was not.

00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:44.920
In 1935, Jewish people were banned
from flying German flags.

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:47.866
And in this way,

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.587
the Germans, maybe more than
any other time in history,

00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:53.661
used the dual power of flags

00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:57.328
to unite but also to divide.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.207
Flags were used as identity weapons.
