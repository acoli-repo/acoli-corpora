00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:33.420
As we become a spacefaring civilization
and we go off into the stars,

00:14:33.444 --> 00:14:35.385
what do our nations mean anyway

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:38.706
when you're standing on the surface
of Mars or any other planet?

00:14:39.682 --> 00:14:41.593
And then of course, back here on Earth,

00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:45.601
as our planet is facing a climate crisis,

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:50.174
as our climate could be unlivable in
our children or grandchildren's lifetime,

00:14:50.198 --> 00:14:54.400
I believe we need a strong symbol, a flag,

00:14:54.424 --> 00:14:56.507
to unite us to fight,

00:14:56.531 --> 00:14:58.439
not just as nations,

00:14:58.463 --> 00:15:00.317
but as a species.
