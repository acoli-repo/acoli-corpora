00:05:57.195 --> 00:06:00.006
of how Germany got to where they'd gotten

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.415
and how to get them out.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.999
He spent entire chapters
in his book "Mein Kampf,"

00:06:05.023 --> 00:06:06.722
which I don't recommend reading,

00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:08.796
about how Germany lost World War I

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.780
partially because the British
had better graphic design

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:14.365
and better propaganda.

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:17.702
So, as the Nazi Party rose,

00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:21.735
Hitler created one of the thickest
brand guides I've ever seen.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.159
It's thicker than most
company brand guides today,

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:27.572
and in it, he details titles and uniforms

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.853
and lots and lots of flags.
