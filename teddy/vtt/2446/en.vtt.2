WEBVTT

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:03.090
to go out and harness this power of flags
and fight for a better world.

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:04.954
But before we get there,

00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:07.688
we're going to start
on the opposite end of the spectrum.

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:12.153
And before I show you the next stuff,
I need to say that anything I show here

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:13.780
is not an endorsement,

00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:15.734
it's usually quite the opposite.

00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:19.735
But more than anything,
what I want to do is create a space here

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.850
where we can look
at these flags, these designs,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.500
and examine how they make us feel.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:27.915
We're going to talk about our emotions.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.567
Is that OK with everybody?

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.896
OK.
