00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:33.278
this was meant to be a symbol
of who was in charge

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:34.792
and who was not.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.649
This remained the flag of Georgia

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:39.892
until the year 2001,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.294
and in that year, they changed their flag

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:44.476
to this.

00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:49.011

this is officially ugly.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.226
OK? It's OK to laugh at this flag.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.945

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.936
that's one of the reasons
they changed it just two years later.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.120
They had a referendum

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.299
where they got to choose
between that thing
