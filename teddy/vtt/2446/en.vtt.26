If the Nazi flag was an identity weapon,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.350
the United States flag, by design alone,
stands in direct contrast.

00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:10.514
And I have to say,
as a vexillologist in 2019,

00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:12.102
using this flag

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:15.099
as an identity weapon against anyone

00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:18.477
disrespects it far more
than letting it touch the ground

00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:21.969
or any one of the other little laws
that we break every day.

00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:23.987
Right?

00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:29.619
This flag is a symbol of our unity.
