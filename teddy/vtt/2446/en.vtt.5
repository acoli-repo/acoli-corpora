00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.222
it has come to represent
the Confederacy to most of us.

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.674
But I shouldn't have to remind you
what the Confederacy is.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.150
It was a rogue nation

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:40.961
that rose up against the United States,

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.045
waged war on the US,

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.293
and at one point in time,

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:47.687
this was one of the most
un-American things you could have.

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:51.318
But yet, this flag is protected

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:54.918
by the same laws that protect
the United States flag

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.996
in the states of Florida, Georgia,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.495
South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana.
