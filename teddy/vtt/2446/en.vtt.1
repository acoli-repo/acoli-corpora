00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.600
with homeless people,

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:33.377
with human beings laying on the ground,

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.241
but not flags?"

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:40.119
And to some of you,
this piece of art is quite disturbing.

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.322
And that's kind of the point
of this talk --

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:46.107
not to upset you or to make you mad

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:51.255
but to prove to you that flags
have an incredible power,

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.237
and that even if you think
you don't care about flags, you do.

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:55.555
You know you do.

00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:57.262
Alright.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.588
By the end of it,
I hope that you're inspired

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:03.090
to go out and harness this power of flags
and fight for a better world.
