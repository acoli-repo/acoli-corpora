South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana.

00:03:01.573 --> 00:03:04.130
But let's pick on Georgia
for a second, shall we?

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:06.474
So in 1956,

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:10.211
a few years after desegregation
was mandated in public schools,

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.620
Georgia changed their state flag to this.

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:17.537
I think everyone watching can agree

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.425
that this was not meant to be a flag
that every Georgian was proud to fly

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.000
outside of their home, was it?

00:03:23.643 --> 00:03:24.991
No.

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:29.620
Just like all of the Confederate statues
erected in the mid-1950s and '60s,

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:33.278
this was meant to be a symbol
of who was in charge
