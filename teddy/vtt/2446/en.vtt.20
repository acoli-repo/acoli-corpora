00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.665
The flag code says, "The flag should never
be carried flat or horizontally,

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:03.643
but always aloft and free."

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:06.283
So sometimes during
the exact same national anthem,

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:08.201
this was being done,
and no one's upset.

00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:11.399
Or this. This happens all the time.

00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:12.588
The flag code is clear:

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:17.600
"No part of the flag should ever be used
as a costume or on an athletic uniform."

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:20.027
This is Texas A&amp;M baseball,

00:10:20.051 --> 00:10:22.976
not to get them in trouble,
but this happens all the time,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.795
especially in November.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.508
I'm sure, I can almost guarantee
when you leave here tonight,

00:10:28.532 --> 00:10:30.911
you will see on the back
of someone's car or truck
