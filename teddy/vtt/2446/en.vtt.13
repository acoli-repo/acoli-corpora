Hitler knew the power of flags.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.328
He says in "Mein Kampf,"

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.169
"The new flag ... should prove
effective as a large poster,

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:39.590
[because] in hundreds
of thousands of cases

00:06:39.614 --> 00:06:42.437
a really striking emblem
may be the first cause

00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:45.195
of awakening interest
in a movement."

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.038
He was an artist, after all.

00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:52.148
He knew the power
of visual identity and uniforms

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:54.885
could reignite the German identity.

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:58.814
And to millions of Germans,
this was a welcome sign.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.720
But of course, this was also
a mark of death to others.
