You cannot be forced to be patriotic.

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:37.016
So why, then, have all of these
little laws around how we use our flag

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.724
if you can't enforce them?

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:43.012
And that's because a nation

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.166
is a fragile collective idea.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.880
It only exists in our minds.

00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:50.401
Can I see this? Thank you.

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:57.741
Sometimes a flag is the only
tangible symbol of that idea.

00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:03.628
Right? Our unity is sometimes
only held together by literal threads.
