00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:31.505
Right?

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.813
And that's why I love flags.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.026
They are the simplest pieces of design,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.528
usually just two or three colors,

00:04:39.552 --> 00:04:41.726
just some bars or stripes.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.720
But yet, they can invoke
the deepest emotions within us.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.543
They'll make us swell with pride

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.250
or burn with hatred.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:53.050
We will die for a flag

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:55.334
or even kill for one.

00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:59.901
One of my favorite designers,
his name is Wally Olins,

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.689
they call him the father
of nation branding,
