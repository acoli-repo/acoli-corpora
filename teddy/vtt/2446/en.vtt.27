We should never use this as a weapon
against someone else.

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:38.258
I resonate so deeply with the person
who wrote in Dread Scott's journal,

00:13:38.282 --> 00:13:42.698
"We should never value the symbol
over the thing that it symbolizes.

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:46.916
We should never value a piece of cloth
over a human life."

00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:50.907
And if you're ever going to use
a piece of cloth as a weapon,

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:52.618
you should never use this one,

00:13:52.642 --> 00:13:56.361
not when it has always
had room for more stars.

00:13:56.822 --> 00:14:00.009
Hopefully by now, you've felt
the power of flags,
