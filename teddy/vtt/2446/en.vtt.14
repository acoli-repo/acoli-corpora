00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.720
But of course, this was also
a mark of death to others.

00:07:04.897 --> 00:07:08.293
We don't often think of flags as weapons,

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:11.169
but like the Confederate battle flag,

00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:13.205
the Germans used their flag

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.895
to make an out-group feel unwelcome

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.195
and less than.

00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:22.185
You see, when you create a flag,
you immediately do two things:

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:23.662
you create an in-group,

00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:26.164
a group that's meant
to be represented by the symbol,

00:07:26.188 --> 00:07:28.350
but then, inevitably,
you create an out-group.

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:30.124
And usually, that's subtle.
