is that those NFL players
kneeling during the anthem

00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:04.142
and the people who would put
Blue Lives Matters stickers on their car

00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.982
are both on the opposite end
of a very big issue,

00:11:07.777 --> 00:11:10.692
but they're both breaking
the exact same law,

00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:15.962
a law that is 100 percent unenforceable.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:21.639
In fact, it was Dread Scott's
piece of art in 1989

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:25.681
that led the Supreme Court to rule
that the flag code is just a guideline.

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:28.194
You cannot be prosecuted
for breaking the flag code.

00:11:28.218 --> 00:11:30.680
You cannot be forced to be patriotic.
