Hopefully by now, you've felt
the power of flags,

00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:03.031
and you can see what they can do.

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:05.850
So what if we harnessed that power,

00:14:05.874 --> 00:14:08.639
and we used it to fight
for something greater?

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:13.096
This is the flag of Earth,

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:16.861
designed by Oskar Pernefeldt of Sweden.

00:14:17.653 --> 00:14:20.256
Just imagine with me for a second:

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.853
What if we celebrated our humanity

00:14:23.877 --> 00:14:25.744
as much if not more

00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:28.392
than we celebrate our nationalities?

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:33.420
As we become a spacefaring civilization
and we go off into the stars,
