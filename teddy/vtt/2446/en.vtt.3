00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.896
OK.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.650
Are you ready for your first flag?

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.476
Cool, we'll start with an easy one.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.358
That was a joke. (Laughs)

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:44.121
So, some of you may be a little bit uneasy
sitting in a room with this.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.817
I'm certainly feeling uneasy
standing in front of it.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.303
Some of you may be feeling
a little bit of pride.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:55.006
And that's understandable. This is Texas.
This is not a rare sight, is it?

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:57.395
But let's start with the facts.

00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.441
So this is not the Confederate flag. OK?
