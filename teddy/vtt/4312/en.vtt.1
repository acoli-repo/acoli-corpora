00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.614
(Laughter)

00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:35.649
(Applause)

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.032
Anyway, it's a great privilege to be here.

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.799
I think it's a bit of a joke

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:43.898
for an editor of a paper to choose
a photographer to open a speaking event.

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:44.954
(Laughter)

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.851
We're not renowned for our words,

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.452
and I spent the last 40 years
hiding behind a camera

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:51.297
so I didn't have to speak.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.303
But I'm here today, and what I want
to talk about are stories

00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:56.104
and the importance of stories to me

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.688
and, I think, the importance
of stories to everybody.

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:01.008
I'm sure today you'll hear
a lot of stories
