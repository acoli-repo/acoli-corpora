I'm sure today you'll hear
a lot of stories

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.136
and, by listening to other
people's stories,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.866
I think we can learn
about the world, about other people

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.427
and get a better understanding.

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.097
So I want to talk about three stories
that I've done as a photographer,

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.095
and how they've inspired me,

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.137
and how, in my life, I've become
a part of the stories

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.825
that I document myself.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.145
As John said, I was a fashion photographer

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:23.931
and music photographer for 10 years.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.558
I enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun,

00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:28.354
but always wanted to do
something more with my work.

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:31.044
And storytelling was always
something I wanted to do.
