00:10:58.656 --> 00:11:01.921
And we all have our own experiences
that we can use as well.

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:04.977
So really, that's all I wanted
to talk about today.

00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:10.066
I just wanted to say that life
goes on all around the world.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.410
People are going through terrible things.

00:11:13.164 --> 00:11:16.024
Everyone of us is going
through our own terrible experience.

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:18.362
But if we share those
and we talk about stories,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.882
then we can inspire each other

00:11:19.906 --> 00:11:22.568
to get through our own bad experiences.

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:26.346
I know that the people I've recorded
have gotten me to this point.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.671
And I hope in some small way,
the stories I've been able to tell you

00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:31.289
will help you get through things.
