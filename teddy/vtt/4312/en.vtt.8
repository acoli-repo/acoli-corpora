00:03:58.854 --> 00:04:01.197
and they managed to get a lot of help.

00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:03.916
And I'm glad to say now,
eight years later,

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.748
I actually spoke to Nick last night,

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:08.900
and he wanted to let me know
that he was feeling a lot better,

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:11.291
and he doesn't do
the self-harming anymore.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.375
And in some small way,
I hope that the photographs

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.902
was a part of that process.

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:20.692
The main thing it did is it inspired
me to go out with my camera

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.683
and to tell other people's stories.

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:28.128
One of the stories I did
was in Kutupalong,

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:31.373
on the border of Burma and Bangladesh.
