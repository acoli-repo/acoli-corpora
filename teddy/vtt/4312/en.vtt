Good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.506
When I was first asked to do a TED Talk,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.247
I Googled to try and find out
a little bit more about,

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:14.610
you know, how it felt to be giving one.

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:17.648
And one of the first things I read
was a speaker in the States

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:20.720
saying that she felt fine
until she came onstage,

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.788
and then she saw the timer ticking down.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:23.850
(Laughter)

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:25.529
And it reminded her of a bomb.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.602
I was thinking,
"That's the last thing I need."

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.614
(Laughter)
