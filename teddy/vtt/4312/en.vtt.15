It's kind of funny to know,
if you look in the background,

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:33.338
you can see the other street kids
who didn't get in the water go,

00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:35.009
"Why would you get in that water?"

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.694
But one of the little kids, Lilic,

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:38.646
he was the one who had taken my camera,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.315
and he started taking photographs.

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.320
He was really excited by this camera.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:45.253
And we talked a lot about
how I was going to get him a camera

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:48.251
and would return and we could start
to teach him photography.

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:49.893
He had a real eye for things.

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.314
That's him, there.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:55.254
That was taken on the last
evening I was there.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:58.873
I'd been staying there, but that night,
I left to go and collect my things.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:01.443
And when I came back
in the morning, he was dead.
