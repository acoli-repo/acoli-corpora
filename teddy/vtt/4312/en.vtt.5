00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.800
Bit by bit, though,
as I got to know him better,

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:35.531
I realized that his story
wasn't being told.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:40.118
He self-harmed, he would punch himself
quite a lot in the face.

00:02:40.142 --> 00:02:43.047
And nobody really got to see that.

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.624
So this is Nick.

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:51.860
He used to describe his life
as living downstairs at a party.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.109
He said he could hear
the party in the kitchen,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.842
but he felt like he was always
trapped in the basement,

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:58.030
in his own little world,

00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:01.486
wanting to be part of the party
but not able to walk upstairs.
