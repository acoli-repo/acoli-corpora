00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:01.443
And when I came back
in the morning, he was dead.

00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:05.079
He had taken a lot of pills
and a lot of vodka.

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:08.709
And he had passed out in the night
and didn’t recover.

00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:11.441
Again, it was another reminder

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.933
of maybe why I should record
these people's stories:

00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:15.590
because their lives are important,

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:18.123
and it's important
for me to document them.

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:22.086
Then in February of last year,
when I was on patrol in Afghanistan,

00:08:22.848 --> 00:08:24.489
I stepped on an IED.

00:08:26.002 --> 00:08:27.701
That's me down there, somewhere.

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:30.707
I became part of the story.
