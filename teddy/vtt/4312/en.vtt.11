00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:32.808
And that's exactly
what their situation is -- helpless.

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:37.748
A child with a tumor that nobody helped,
who was slowly suffocating.

00:05:39.562 --> 00:05:41.209
I got in a bit of a panic,

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.728
because these people were
coming up to me, desperate,

00:05:43.752 --> 00:05:46.009
and I was trying to explain
to the village elder

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.974
that I was not a doctor,
and I couldn't help these people.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.230
And the village elder
turned to me and he said,

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:54.519
"No, it's really important;
these people know you're not a doctor,

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:56.930
but at least somebody
is now telling their story,

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:59.754
and somebody is recording
what is happening to them."
