00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:02.128
And it was a good moment for me.

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:06.004
It was a realization
that maybe it was worthwhile

00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:08.121
going off and doing these things.

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:13.434
Another story that inspired me
was in Odessa, in Ukraine.

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:15.917
I was documenting a bunch of street kids.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.897
I ended up actually living
with them in a squat,

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.328
which I can say was an experience.

00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:25.167
Many late nights of vodka-fueled violence

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.588
with me sitting in the corner with my bag,

00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.970
just going, "When was this a good idea?"

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:31.105
(Laughter)
