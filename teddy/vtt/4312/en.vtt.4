00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.281
but at the time,
I couldn't really work out

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.140
how could I use my photography
to do something useful.

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.598
So I gave up photography.

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:09.985
I walked away from it completely
and decided to do care work.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.222
As a care worker, I started looking
after a young guy called Nick.

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:18.707
Nick has autism, very severe autism.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.288
But over the years of looking after him,
we became very close friends.

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:24.951
I would give him a 24-hour care,

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:28.500
we would go off and do things
from swimming, going for walks ...

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:29.859
all sorts.
