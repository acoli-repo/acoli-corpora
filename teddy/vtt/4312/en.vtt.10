00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:00.788
the people would come along the next day,

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:03.080
and I would take portraits
of all these people

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:04.447
and record their stories.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:08.661
So as the time went on,
I turned up in the morning,

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:12.922
I put a big, white sheet up,
and I started to photograph these people.

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:16.815
Suddenly, though, everything
got a bit out of control,

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.460
and, although it was still dawn,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.523
we were filled in this small
little compound we had made

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:26.605
with literally hundreds of people
turning up with ailments and diseases

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.633
and just ... a hopeless situation.
