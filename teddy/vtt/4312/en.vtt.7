00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.612
As we built up a kind
of closer friendship,

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:35.838
he finally would allow me
to actually see him doing this

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:37.014
and to document it.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.191
It was a moment of trust.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:44.335
The social services were not
particularly good at helping Nick,

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.648
and they said that he wouldn't be
self-harming as bad as we said.

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:52.456
So one day, I took a photograph
of when he'd really been self-harming.

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:56.047
We took that to the social services,

00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.830
and their reaction was immediately
incredibly different,

00:03:58.854 --> 00:04:01.197
and they managed to get a lot of help.
