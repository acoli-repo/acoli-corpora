00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:30.707
I became part of the story.

00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:35.370
At first, I was devastated
by what had happened, obviously.

00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:38.496
I thought my work was over,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.915
I thought -- everything
didn't make sense to me.

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:45.446
And then I realized:
I never set out to Congo,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.258
to Angola, to Bangladesh

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:48.882
to take photographs.

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:52.382
I went to those places because I wanted
to make some kind of change,

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.423
and photography happened to be my tool.

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:59.195
And then I became aware
that my body was, in many ways,

00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:01.728
a living example
of what war does to somebody.
