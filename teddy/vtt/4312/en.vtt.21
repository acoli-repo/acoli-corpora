00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:31.083
We can all be cogs in a wheel of change.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:32.667
We can all make a difference.

00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:35.509
Everybody here has an ability
to use something

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.241
to make a difference to the world.

00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:40.239
We can all sit in front of the TV and go,

00:10:40.263 --> 00:10:42.931
"I don't know what to do
about it," and forget about it.

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.235
But the reality is that we can
all do something.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.045
It might be just writing a letter.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:49.579
It might be standing
on a soapbox and talking.

00:10:49.603 --> 00:10:51.677
It might be just recording
somebody's story

00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:53.332
and telling it to somebody else.

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:55.149
But every single one of us here,

00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:58.632
if we want to make a difference, we can,
an there is nothing to stop us.

00:10:58.656 --> 00:11:01.921
And we all have our own experiences
that we can use as well.
