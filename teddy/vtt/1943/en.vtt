00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My travels to Afghanistan

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
began many, many years ago

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
on the eastern border of my country,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
my homeland, Poland.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was walking through the forests

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of my grandmother's tales.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A land where every field hides a grave,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
where millions of people

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
have been deported or killed

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in the 20th century.
