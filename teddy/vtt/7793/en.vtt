In the year 6 CE,

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:06.461
a fire devastated Rome.

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:07.879
In response,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.258
Emperor Augustus did something
that had never been done before

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.135
in the history of the Empire.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:18.765
He created a permanent
team of firefighters

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:21.601
who used buckets just like this one.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:28.775
Augustus understood that individuals alone
can't protect themselves from fires.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.527
They need help from the community.
