00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.315
Because architecture is the art

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:35.887
of making shelter for communities,

00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:37.693
not just for individuals --

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:41.420
communities and society at large.

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:43.792
And society is never the same.

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.609
The world keeps changing.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.150
And changes are difficult
to swallow by people.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.650
And architecture is a mirror
of those changes.

00:03:56.014 --> 00:04:01.612
Architecture is the built expression
of those changes.
