00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:35.204
Real beauty is when the invisible

00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:39.983
joins the visible, coming on surface.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.996
And this doesn't apply
only to art or nature.

00:13:46.507 --> 00:13:51.881
This applies to science,
human curiosity, solidarity --

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:55.275
that's the reason why you may say,

00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:58.585
"This is a beautiful person,"

00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:00.405
"That's a beautiful mind."
