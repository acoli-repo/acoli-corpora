00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:01.639
in Japan.

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:05.215
To make a building, sometimes
you need to make an island,

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:06.835
and we made the island.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.642
The building is more than one mile long.

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:15.096
It looks like an immense glider,
landing on the ground.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.926
And this is in San Francisco.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.617
Another place for people.

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:23.207
This building is the California
Academy of Sciences.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.585
And we planted on that roof --

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:33.560
thousands and thousands of plants
that use the humidity of the air,
