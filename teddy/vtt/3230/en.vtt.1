00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.480
And the life of the architect
is also amazing.

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:36.175
You know, as an architect,
at 10 o’clock in the morning,

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.309
you need to be a poet, for sure.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.741
But at 11,

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.371
you must become a humanist,

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:46.751
otherwise you'd lose your direction.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:52.210
And at noon, you absolutely
need to be a builder.

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:56.467
You need to be able to make a building,

00:00:56.491 --> 00:01:01.382
because architecture, at the end,
is the art of making buildings.
