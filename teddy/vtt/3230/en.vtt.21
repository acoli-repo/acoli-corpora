This monastery is playing
with the silence and the forest.

00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:35.180
And a museum, a science museum.

00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:37.642
This is about levitation.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.791
And this is in the center of Paris,

00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:44.910
in the belly of the whale.

00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:47.546
This is the Pathé Foundation in Paris.

00:10:49.178 --> 00:10:52.105
All those buildings
have something in common:

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:58.919
it's that something is searching
for desire, for dreams.

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:00.537
And that's me.
