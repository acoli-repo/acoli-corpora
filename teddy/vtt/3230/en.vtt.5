00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:33.244
From rock climbers to deepwater divers.

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:35.029
This is in Berlin.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.966
After the fall of the Wall in '89,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.093
we built this building, connecting
East Berlin to West Berlin,

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:43.720
in Potsdamer Platz.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:49.177
We got on that project
almost 5,000 people.

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:51.796
Almost 5,000 people.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.859
And this is another site in Japan,

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.026
building the Kansai Airport.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.201
Again, all the rock climbers,
Japanese ones.
