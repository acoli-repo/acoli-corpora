00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:41.990
Light is probably one of the most
essential materials in architecture.

00:09:42.789 --> 00:09:44.455
And this is in Amsterdam.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.636
This building is flirting with water.

00:09:49.162 --> 00:09:52.321
And this is my office, on the sea.

00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:56.115
Well, this is flirting with work.

00:09:56.572 --> 00:09:58.993
