Together with my friend
in adventure, Richard Rogers,

00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:39.101
we were, at the time, young bad boys.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.329
Young, bad boys.

00:04:40.353 --> 00:04:41.388
(Laughter)

00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:46.178
It was really only
a few years after May '68.

00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:50.077
So it was a rebellion, pure rebellion.

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.133
The idea was to make

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:58.410
the proof that cultural buildings
should not be intimidating.

00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:02.006
They should create a sense of curiosity.
