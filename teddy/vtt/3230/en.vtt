Architecture is amazing, for sure.

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:07.761
It's amazing because it's art.

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.037
But you know, it's a very
funny kind of art.

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.937
It's an art at the frontier
between art and science.

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:17.509
It's fed by ...

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:21.015
by real life, every day.

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.376
It's driven by force of necessity.

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:27.837
Quite amazing, quite amazing.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.480
And the life of the architect
is also amazing.
