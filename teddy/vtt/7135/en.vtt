Chris Anderson: Mike, welcome.

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:04.975
It's good to see you.
I'm excited for this conversation.

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.769
Michael Levin: Thank you so much.
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:10.852
CA: So, most of us have
this mental model in biology

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:15.136
that DNA is a property
of every living thing,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.571
that it is kind of the software
that builds the hardware of our body.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.682
That's how a lot of us think about this.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:25.949
That model leaves too many deep mysteries.

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:28.920
Can you share with us
some of those mysteries

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:31.538
and also what tadpoles have to do with it?
