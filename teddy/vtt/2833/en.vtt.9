00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.536
and that you can actually see her
with your naked eye on a clear night.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.656
So we decided to use data
to create a connection

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.736
between Samantha and all of the people
looking at her from below.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.936
We designed and developed
what we called "Friends in Space,"

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.616
a web application that simply
lets you say "hello" to Samantha

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.896
from where you are,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.456
and "hello" to all the people
who are online at the same time

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000
from all over the world.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.096
And all of these "hellos"
left visible marks on the map

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.136
as Samantha was flying by

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.536
and as she was actually
waving back every day at us
