WEBVTT

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.949
contains the address
of the other person, of course,

00:07:01.973 --> 00:07:04.613
and the legend for how
to interpret our drawing.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.656
The very first week into the project,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.736
we actually chose
a pretty cold and impersonal topic.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.960
How many times do we
check the time in a week?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.656
So here is the front of my card,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.656
and you can see that every little symbol

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.096
represents all of the times
that I checked the time,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.496
positioned for days
and different hours chronologically --

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560
nothing really complicated here.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.776
But then you see in the legend

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.256
how I added anecdotal details
about these moments.
