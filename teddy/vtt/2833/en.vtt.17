Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker
to waitresses and waiters,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.360
but I definitely don't thank enough
the people who are close to me.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.256
Over one year,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.776
the process of actively noticing
and counting these types of actions

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.096
became a ritual.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.176
It actually changed ourselves.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.896
We became much more
in tune with ourselves,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.040
much more aware of our behaviors
and our surroundings.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.656
Over one year, Stefanie and I
connected at a very deep level

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.696
through our shared data diary,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.016
but we could do this only because
we put ourselves in these numbers,
