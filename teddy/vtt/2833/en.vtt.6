00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.776
made us focus on these two digits

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.000
and them alone.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.616
In an effort to simplify the message

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.056
and draw a beautiful,
inevitable red and blue map,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.960
we lost the point completely.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.576
We somehow forgot
that there were stories --

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.960
stories of human beings
behind these numbers.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.816
In a different context,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.496
but to a very similar point,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.416
a peculiar challenge was presented
to my team by this woman.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.816
She came to us with a lot of data,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.256
but ultimately she wanted to tell
one of the most humane stories possible.
