00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.776
taught me that to make data faithfully
representative of our human nature

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.216
and to make sure they will not
mislead us anymore,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.936
we need to start designing ways
to include empathy, imperfection

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.536
and human qualities

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.280
in how we collect, process,
analyze and display them.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.256
I do see a place where, ultimately,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.616
instead of using data
only to become more efficient,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.440
we will all use data
to become more humane.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.096
Thank you.
