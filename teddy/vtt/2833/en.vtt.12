00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.696
a London-based designer who shares with me
the passion and obsession about data.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.056
We didn't know each other,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.336
but we decided to run
a very radical experiment,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.896
starting a communication using only data,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.256
no other language,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.896
and we opted for using no technology
whatsoever to share our data.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.816
In fact, our only means of communication

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.696
would be through
the old-fashioned post office.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.176
For "Dear Data," every week for one year,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.656
we used our personal data
to get to know each other --
