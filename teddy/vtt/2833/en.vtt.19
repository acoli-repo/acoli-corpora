00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.256
Because data alone
will never give us a solution.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.976
And this is why data failed us so badly --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.376
because we failed to include
the right amount of context

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.856
to represent reality --

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.080
a nuanced, complicated
and intricate reality.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.416
We kept looking at these two numbers,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.936
obsessing with them

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.456
and pretending that our world
could be reduced

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.816
to a couple digits and a horse race,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.096
while the real stories,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.576
the ones that really mattered,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.016
were somewhere else.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.456
What we missed looking at these stories
only through models and algorithms
