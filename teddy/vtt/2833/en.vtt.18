00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.016
but we could do this only because
we put ourselves in these numbers,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.016
adding the contexts
of our very personal stories to them.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.496
It was the only way
to make them truly meaningful

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.720
and representative of ourselves.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.576
I am not asking you
to start drawing your personal data,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.456
or to find a pen pal across the ocean.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.056
But I'm asking you to consider data --

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.536
all kind of data --

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.336
as the beginning of the conversation

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.560
and not the end.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.256
Because data alone
will never give us a solution.
