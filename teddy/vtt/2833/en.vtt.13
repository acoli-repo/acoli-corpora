WEBVTT

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.656
we used our personal data
to get to know each other --

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.336
personal data around weekly
shared mundane topics,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.576
from our feelings

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.456
to the interactions with our partners,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.640
from the compliments we received
to the sounds of our surroundings.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.016
Personal information
that we would then manually hand draw

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.536
on a postcard-size sheet of paper

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.496
that we would every week
send from London to New York,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.776
where I live,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.000
and from New York to London,
where she lives.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.176
The front of the postcard
is the data drawing,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.496
and the back of the card

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.949
contains the address
of the other person, of course,
