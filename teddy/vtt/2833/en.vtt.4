00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.216
This was the first time

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.800
when the data I had gave me
a completely distorted image of reality.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.576
My data sample was actually
pretty limited and skewed,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.336
so probably it was because of that,
I thought, I lived in a bubble,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960
and I didn't have enough chances
to see outside of it.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.856
Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.080
in the United States.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.256
The internet polls,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.656
statistical models,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.496
all the pundits agreeing on a possible
outcome for the presidential election.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.136
It looked like we had
enough information this time,
