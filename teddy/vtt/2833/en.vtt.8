00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.296
the speed and position of the ISS

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.000
and all of the other thousands
of live streams from its sensors.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.736
We had all of the hard data
we could think of --

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.176
just like the pundits
before the election --

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.176
but what is the point
of all these numbers?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.936
People are not interested
in data for the sake of it,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.815
because numbers are never the point.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.800
They're always the means to an end.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.616
The story we needed to tell

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.136
is that there is a human being
in a teeny box

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.416
flying in space above your head,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.536
and that you can actually see her
with your naked eye on a clear night.
