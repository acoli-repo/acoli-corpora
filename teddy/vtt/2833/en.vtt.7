and she contacted us before being launched

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.016
on a six-month-long expedition
to the International Space Station.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.256
She told us, "I'm going to space,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.376
and I want to do something meaningful
with the data of my mission

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.640

A mission to the
International Space Station

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.256
comes with terabytes of data

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.656
about anything you can possibly imagine --

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.176
the orbits around Earth,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.296
the speed and position of the ISS
