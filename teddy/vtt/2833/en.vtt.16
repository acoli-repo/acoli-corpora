00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.176
my never-ending anxiety for being late,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.400
even though I'm absolutely always on time.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.296
Stefanie and I spent one year
collecting our data manually

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.816
to force us to focus on the nuances
that computers cannot gather --

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.376
or at least not yet --

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.896
using data also to explore our minds
and the words we use,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.856
and not only our activities.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.296
Like at week number three,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.136
where we tracked the "thank yous"
we said and were received,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.816
and when I realized that I thank
mostly people that I don't know.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.176
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker
to waitresses and waiters,
