00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.136
It looked like we had
enough information this time,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.256
and many more chances to see outside
the closed circle we lived in --

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.600
but we clearly didn't.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.136
The feeling felt very familiar.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.640
I had been there before.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.216
I think it's fair to say
the data failed us this time --

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.096
and pretty spectacularly.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.816
We believed in data,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.256
but what happened,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.976
even with the most respected newspaper,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.696
is that the obsession to reduce everything
to two simple percentage numbers

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.696
to make a powerful headline

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.776
made us focus on these two digits
