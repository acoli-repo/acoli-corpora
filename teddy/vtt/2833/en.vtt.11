that working with data
means designing ways

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.776
to transform the abstract
and the uncountable

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.816
into something that can be seen,
felt and directly reconnected

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.136
to our lives and to our behaviors,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.016
something that is hard to achieve

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.936
if we let the obsession for the numbers
and the technology around them

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.240
lead us in the process.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.496
But we can do even more to connect data
to the stories they represent.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.176
We can remove technology completely.

A few years ago, I met this other woman,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.856
Stefanie Posavec --

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.696
a London-based designer who shares with me
the passion and obsession about data.
