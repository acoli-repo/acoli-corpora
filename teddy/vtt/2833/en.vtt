00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.640
This is what my last week looked like.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.376
What I did,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.216
who I was with,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.360
the main sensations I had
for every waking hour ...

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.576
If the feeling came as I thought of my dad

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.376
who recently passed away,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.456
or if I could have just definitely
avoided the worries and anxieties.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.416
And if you think I'm a little obsessive,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.296
you're probably right.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.576
But clearly, from this visualization,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.896
you can learn much more about me
than from this other one,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.896
which are images you're
probably more familiar with
