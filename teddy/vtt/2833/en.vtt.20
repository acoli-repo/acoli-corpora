What we missed looking at these stories
only through models and algorithms

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.000
is what I call "data humanism."

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.576
In the Renaissance humanism,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.216
European intellectuals

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.160
placed the human nature instead of God
at the center of their view of the world.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.016
I believe something similar
needs to happen

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.816
with the universe of data.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.816
Now data are apparently
treated like a God --

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.120
keeper of infallible truth
for our present and our future.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.736
The experiences
that I shared with you today

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.776
taught me that to make data faithfully
representative of our human nature
