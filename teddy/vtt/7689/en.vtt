00:00:02.248 --> 00:00:05.084
Thank you all so much, how's it going?

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.920
How are you doing, TED, TEDWomen?

00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:11.090
They brought me in
for a bit of comic relief.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.635
Iâ€™m so excited to be here at TEDWomen.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.221
You know, I think I speak for myself,

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:19.390
but also for all of us,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.226
when I think I'm really inspired,
you know, and personally,

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.355
I feel like I'm not going to stop
until every person,

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:28.399
living or dead, is a woman.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.568
