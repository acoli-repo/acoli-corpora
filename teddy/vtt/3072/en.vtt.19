00:09:28.764 --> 00:09:31.471
protest has given her a sense
of meaning and direction.

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:33.839
And though she knows the odds against her,

00:09:33.863 --> 00:09:35.066
Linda perseveres.

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:39.368
Like Linda and other
young African activists,

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:41.885
we all must work to redefine democracy

00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:44.992
as something more than just
elections and political parties.

00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:48.736
Democracy is a creative process,

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:51.926
and protest has always been the vehicle

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.100
for expanding our political imaginations
beyond what we are told is possible.

00:09:56.124 --> 00:09:57.842
(In Swahili) Thank you very much.

00:09:57.866 --> 00:10:01.198
(Applause)
