00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:30.003
the capture of our
political parties by elites

00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:33.053
accompanied by the hollowing
out of civil society

00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:35.543
that once provided a voice
to ordinary people;

00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.930
that sinking feeling
that no matter what you do,

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.336
external factors related
to the global economy

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.802
can disrupt our lives for the worse.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.655
Our political leaders seem helpless,

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:49.971
insisting on austerity,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.863
even as public goods diminish
to levels unseen in decades.

00:06:54.398 --> 00:06:58.185
And this is when they're not succumbing
to exclusionary nationalism,

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:01.686
blaming our woes on the weak
rather than the powerful.
