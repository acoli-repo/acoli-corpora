00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.035
And I believe that African activists
are redefining democracy

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.089
by putting protest at its center,

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.437
what I refer to as "protest democracy."

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.632
International organizations
and academic experts

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:48.819
define democracy as regular,
multiparty electoral competition.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.782
But democracy should not only be
about elites competing at the ballot box.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.951
For it to have meaning,

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.985
it's something we must
engage in every day.
