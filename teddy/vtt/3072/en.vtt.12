Formal jobs in the industrial sector
are actually decreasing,

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.998
with informal labor the only option left
for people to eke out a living.

00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:09.123
As a result, inequality is skyrocketing,

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.154
and political leaders
are increasingly disconnected

00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:14.305
from their much younger populations.

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:16.425
For those of us from outside of Africa,

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.399
we're familiar with parts of this story:

00:06:18.888 --> 00:06:20.658
a massive spike in inequality,

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.981
the product of a decline
in good jobs for good wages

00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:27.030
that were once considered
the hallmark of an advanced society;

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:30.003
the capture of our
political parties by elites
