Tajamuka in Zimbabwe,

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:35.051
LUCHA and Filimbi
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:40.620
movements that work outside of more
conventional nongovernmental organizations

00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:41.969
and political parties

00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:44.551
to challenge the economic
and political system itself,

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:46.602
often at great risk.

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:50.762
Brilliant young activists
like LUCHA's Fred Bauma

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:52.820
have been detained and tortured,

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.410
often with little to no outcry
from the international community.

00:04:57.018 --> 00:05:00.371
The list goes on, as you can see
from some of the data we collected.
