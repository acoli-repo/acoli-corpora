00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.792
in Egypt and Sudan,

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:33.404
against brutal dictatorships;

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:36.221
in Uganda and Ethiopia,

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.909
against powerful militarized states

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:41.590
with quasi-democratic veneers;

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.668
in South Africa,
where this image was taken,

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:48.148
and Burundi,

00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:50.254
against democratically elected leaders

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:53.559
who have done little to improve
the conditions for ordinary people.

00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:57.425
Across the continent,
protest is not exceptional,

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.026
but a normal part of life.
