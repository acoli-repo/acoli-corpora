Africans use protests
to challenge both dictators

00:03:03.964 --> 00:03:05.462
as well as power cuts.

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:10.424
In a way, Africans are protesting
democracy itself,

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:13.322
enriching its possibilities for us all.

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.852
There have been two
major waves of African protest,

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:19.064
and we are currently living
through the third,

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:20.719
which began around 2005.

00:03:20.743 --> 00:03:22.757
It includes the so-called Arab Spring,

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.808
which took place mostly on the continent.

00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:30.186
The first wave took place
in the 1940s and 1950s
