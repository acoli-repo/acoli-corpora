00:00:00.878 --> 00:00:04.268
Like many of you, I'm often frustrated
by the democratic process.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.317
It's messy, it's complicated,

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.773
it's often inefficient.

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:11.765
Our political leaders feel disconnected

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:14.148
from the concerns of ordinary people.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.599
Many feel that voting every few years

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.123
for leaders disconnected
from their daily challenges

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:21.329
is pointless.

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:25.399
But before we reject democracy,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.188
let's imagine what it could be.

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.035
And I believe that African activists
are redefining democracy
