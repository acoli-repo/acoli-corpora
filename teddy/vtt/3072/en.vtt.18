Many young people in Africa
have grown up in societies

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.910
where a single ruler
has ruled their entire lives.

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:08.525
Protest is the space
for new possibilities to emerge,

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:11.013
as young people begin
to discover their own power.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:15.479
Consider the situation
of my friend Linda Masarira,

00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:17.944
a single mother of five,

00:09:17.968 --> 00:09:21.300
who is leading protests
against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.748
She has been beaten, arrested, harassed.

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:28.740
But Linda perseveres, because
as she told me a few months ago,

00:09:28.764 --> 00:09:31.471
protest has given her a sense
of meaning and direction.
