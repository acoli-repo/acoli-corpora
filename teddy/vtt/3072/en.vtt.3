African social movements
have often been at the forefront

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:41.244
of conceptualizing democracy in this way.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.693
This may come as a surprise
to those of who think

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:46.243
that the only way
Africans engage in politics

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:47.865
is through the barrel of the gun.

But increasingly, young people
are taking to the streets

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.115
and abandoning organized violence

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.259
in favor of more effective
nonviolent action.
