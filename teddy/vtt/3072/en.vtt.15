00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:32.934
We must instead work to center
ordinary people in democratic life.

00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.579
Protest provides us one way to do that.

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:39.315
Regardless of your age,
sexuality, your gender,

00:07:40.177 --> 00:07:43.736
whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen,
able-bodied or disabled,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.076
anyone can participate.

00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:47.888
In contrast to elections,

00:07:47.912 --> 00:07:50.654
protests are not confined
by rigid electoral cycles.

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.381
They offer a much more
immediate form of action

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:54.963
in our era of instant feedback.

00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:59.063
Second, while protests may be messy,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.477
this is what makes them powerful.
