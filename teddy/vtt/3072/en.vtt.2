When I say "protest democracy,"

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.377
I'm challenging how we think
about democratic action.

00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.195
Viewing democracy as only elections
is no longer adequate

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.714
and threatens democracy itself.

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:20.957
