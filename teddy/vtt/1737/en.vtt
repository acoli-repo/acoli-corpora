00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's talk trash.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know, we had to be taught

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to renounce the powerful conservation ethic

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
toward creation of products for peacetime.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Life Magazine helped in this effort

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
by announcing the introduction of throwaways

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mental note to the liberators:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
