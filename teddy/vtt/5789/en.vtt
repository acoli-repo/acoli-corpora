00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.486
Nature reveals itself to us
in unique ways,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.027
if we stop and look at the world
through a window of time.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.466
Over the last decade,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.156
I've observed endangered species
and habitats around the world,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.011
using a photographic technique
that captures the passage of time,

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:18.966
literally from day to night,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.023
all within a single image.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.973
It has allowed me to witness

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:27.006
the fleeting moments
between wildlife and the natural habitat

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.153
as time changes
over the course of a single day.
