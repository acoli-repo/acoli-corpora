Vivek Murthy: My name is Vivek,
and I am a physician by training,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.032
but most importantly,
I'm a dad of two toddlers.

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.946

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.780
When I was going through
my residency training

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.405
after medical school,

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.365
we were told when we started the program

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:21.126
that we should, in fact,
call our family and close friends

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.979

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:28.166
We were told that dealing with
life-and-death situations,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.691
excruciating illness

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:33.831
and incredibly delicate
and difficult family circumstances
