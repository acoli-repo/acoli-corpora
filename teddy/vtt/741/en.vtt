00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first question is this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our country has two exploration programs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we have other manifestations of space exploration.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, there's also another program,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?"
