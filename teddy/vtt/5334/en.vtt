00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:02.102
Alright.

00:00:02.126 --> 00:00:05.103
I'd like to start
with a small imagination exercise.

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:09.317
Imagine you're sitting at this table,
facing me right now.

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:13.325
Now, I'm going to ask you
to push one of these cards towards me.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.388
So please imagine yourself
pushing one of these cards towards me.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:21.799
OK, so take the number
matching the card you pushed

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:24.348
and remember it --
it's important for later.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.291
Now, I'm going to flip
through this deck of cards

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:31.379
and ask you to choose a card
that you will see in the deck.
