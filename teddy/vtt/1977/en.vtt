00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:04.700
I'm not quite sure whether
I really want to see a snare drum

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.796
at nine o'clock or so in the morning.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.218
(Laughter)

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:12.312
But anyway, it's just great
to see such a full theater,

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:15.621
and really, I must thank
Herbie Hancock and his colleagues

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.149
for such a great presentation.

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:21.244
(Applause)

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.454
One of the interesting things, of course,

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:30.431
is the combination of that raw hand
on the instrument and technology,
