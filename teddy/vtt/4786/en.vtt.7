00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:32.116
that corresponds 
to girl plus boy to the fifth power.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.660
So we look at the row five,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.131
where the first number 
corresponds to five girls,

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:39.929
and the last corresponds to five boys.

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.692
The third number 
is what we're looking for.

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:46.642
Ten out of the sum 
of all the possibilities in the row.

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:51.490
so 10/32, or 31.25%.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.316
Or, if you're randomly 
picking a five-player basketball team

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:57.084
out of a group of twelve friends,

00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.102
how many possible groups 
of five are there?
