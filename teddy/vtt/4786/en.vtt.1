00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.085
after French mathematician Blaise Pascal,

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:35.234
which seems a bit unfair
since he was clearly late to the party,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.476
but he still had a lot to contribute.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:42.270
So what is it about this that has so 
intrigued mathematicians the world over?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.124
In short, 
it's full of patterns and secrets.

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:49.428
First and foremost, there's the pattern
that generates it.

00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:54.477
Start with one and imagine invisible
zeros on either side of it.

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:58.592
Add them together in pairs, 
and you'll generate the next row.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:02.066
Now, do that again and again.
