00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:31.107
you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2).

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:34.023
The coefficients, 
or numbers in front of the variables,

00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:38.397
are the same as the numbers in that row
of Pascal's Triangle.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:43.256
You'll see the same thing with n=3,
which expands to this.

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:48.493
So the triangle is a quick and easy way
to look up all of these coefficients.

00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:50.037
But there's much more.

00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:52.897
For example, add up 
the numbers in each row,

00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:56.039
and you'll get successive powers of two.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.221
Or in a given row, treat each number
as part of a decimal expansion.
