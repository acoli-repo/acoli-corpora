00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:02.066
Now, do that again and again.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.784
Keep going and you'll wind up 
with something like this,

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:09.325
though really Pascal's Triangle 
goes on infinitely.

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:14.914
Now, each row corresponds to what's called
the coefficients of a binomial expansion

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:18.898
of the form (x+y)^n,

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:21.307
where n is the number of the row,

00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:23.746
and we start counting from zero.

00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:26.552
So if you make n=2 and expand it,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:31.107
you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2).
