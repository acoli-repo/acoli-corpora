00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.117
The first two aren't very interesting:
all ones, and then the positive integers,

00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:36.656
also known as natural numbers.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:40.707
But the numbers in the next diagonal
are called the triangular numbers

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:42.783
because if you take that many dots,

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:46.389
you can stack them 
into equilateral triangles.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.307
The next diagonal 
has the tetrahedral numbers

00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:54.622
because similarly, you can stack
that many spheres into tetrahedra.

00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:57.996
Or how about this:
shade in all of the odd numbers.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:00.881
It doesn't look like much
when the triangle's small,
