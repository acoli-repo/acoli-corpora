00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:00.881
It doesn't look like much
when the triangle's small,

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.298
but if you add thousands of rows,

00:03:03.298 --> 00:03:07.439
you get a fractal 
known as Sierpinski's Triangle.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.756
This triangle isn't just 
a mathematical work of art.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.742
It's also quite useful,

00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:15.481
especially when it comes 
to probability and calculations

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:18.566
in the domain of combinatorics.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.454
Say you want to have five children,

00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:22.270
and would like to know the probability

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.590
of having your dream family 
of three girls and two boys.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.388
In the binomial expansion,

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:32.116
that corresponds 
to girl plus boy to the fifth power.
