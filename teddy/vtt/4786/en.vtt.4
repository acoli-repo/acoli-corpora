00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.221
Or in a given row, treat each number
as part of a decimal expansion.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:07.835
In other words, row two is
(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100).

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:12.111
You get 121, which is 11^2.

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.872
And take a look at what happens
when you do the same thing to row six.

00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:25.136
It adds up to 1,771,561,
which is 11^6, and so on.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.890
There are also geometric applications.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.691
Look at the diagonals.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.117
The first two aren't very interesting:
all ones, and then the positive integers,
