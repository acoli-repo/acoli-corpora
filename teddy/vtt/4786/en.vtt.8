00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.102
how many possible groups 
of five are there?

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:05.062
In combinatoric terms, this problem would
be phrased as twelve choose five,

00:04:05.062 --> 00:04:07.237
and could be calculated with this formula,

00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:11.708
or you could just look at the sixth 
element of row twelve on the triangle

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.383
and get your answer.

00:04:13.383 --> 00:04:15.079
The patterns in Pascal's Triangle

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.387
are a testament to the elegantly 
interwoven fabric of mathematics.

00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:23.271
And it's still revealing fresh secrets
to this day.

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:27.422
For example, mathematicians recently 
discovered a way to expand it

00:04:27.422 --> 00:04:30.019
to these kinds of polynomials.
