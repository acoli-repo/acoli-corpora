00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.138
and then the blood actually recognizes

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:02.725
that that's happening, 
and produces fibrin,

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:06.470
producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.349
So now this technology — Thank you.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.733
(Applause)

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.188
So now this technology, by January,
will be in the hands of veterinarians,

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:23.765
and we're working very diligently to 
try to get it into the hands of doctors,

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.530
hopefully within the next year.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.137
But really, once again, I 
want you guys to imagine

00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.160
that you are a soldier running 
through a battlefield.
