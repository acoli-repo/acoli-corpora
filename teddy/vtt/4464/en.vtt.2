00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.743
at actually how does the body work.

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:02.133
So now, everybody here knows

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.230
that the body is made up of cells.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.947
So the cell is the most basic unit of life.

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.411
But not many people know what else.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:11.942
But it actually turns out that your cells

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:14.686
sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.319
proteins and sugars

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.331
known as the extracellular matrix.

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.160
So now, the ECM

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.190
is actually this mesh that 
holds the cells in place,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.030
provides structure for your tissues,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.476
but it also gives the cells a home.

00:01:27.476 --> 00:01:29.603
It allows them to feel what they're doing,

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.188
where they are, and tells them
