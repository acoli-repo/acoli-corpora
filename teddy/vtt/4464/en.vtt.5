00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.233
poorly formed extracellular matrix.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.291
So now, behind me is an animation

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:33.899
of the extracellular matrix.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.555
So as you see, your cells sit 
in this complicated mesh

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:39.187
and as you move throughout the tissue,

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:41.268
the extracellular matrix changes.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:44.075
So now every other piece 
of technology on the market

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.151
can only manage a two-
dimensional approximation

00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.906
of the extracellular matrix,

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.694
which means that it doesn't fit in

00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:52.460
with the tissue itself.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.260
So when I was a freshman at NYU,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.464
what I discovered was 
you could actually take

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:58.985
small pieces of plant-derived polymers

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.639
and reassemble them onto the wound.
