00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.320
you're able to reassemble 
into it immediately.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.681
Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.040
blood warning —

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.840
at twice human artery pressure.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.273
So now, this type of bleed 
is incredibly traumatic,

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:42.500
and like I said before, 
would actually take

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.356
five minutes or more with pressure

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.728
to be able to stop.

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:48.749
Now, in the time that it takes
me to introduce the bleed itself,

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.878
our material is able to stop that bleed,

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:53.154
and it's because it actually 
goes on and works

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.886
with the body to heal,

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:57.258
so it reassembles into this piece of meat,

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.138
and then the blood actually recognizes
