00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.160
that you are a soldier running 
through a battlefield.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.927
Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:35.260
and instead of bleeding 
out in three minutes,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.248
you pull a small pack 
of gel out of your belt,

00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:38.575
and with the press of a button,

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:39.984
you're able to stop your own bleed

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:41.893
and you're on your way to recovery.

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:43.783
Thank you very much.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.783
