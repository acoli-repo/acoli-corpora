00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.327
I want you guys to imagine 
that you're a soldier

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.228
running through the battlefield.

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:07.444
Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.671
which severs your femoral artery.

00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.797
Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:14.532
and can kill you in less 
than three minutes.

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:16.600
Unfortunately, by the time that a medic

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.276
actually gets to you,

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:20.527
what the medic has on his or her belt

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.787
can take five minutes or more,

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:25.951
with the application of pressure,
to stop that type of bleed.

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.204
Now, this problem is 
not only a huge problem

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.893
for the military, but it's 
also a huge problem
