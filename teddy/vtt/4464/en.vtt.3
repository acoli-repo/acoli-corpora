WEBVTT

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.188
where they are, and tells them

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:33.528
how to act and how to behave.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:36.460
And it actually turns out that 
the extracellular matrix

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.423
is different from every 
single part of the body.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:40.840
So the ECM in my skin

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.955
is different than the ECM in my liver,

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.733
and the ECM in different 
parts of the same organ

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.941
actually vary, so it's very difficult

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.718
to be able to have a product

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.125
that will react to the 
local extracellular matrix,

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.218
which is exactly what we're trying to do.

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.940
So now, for example, 
think of the rainforest.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.325
You have the canopy, 
you have the understory,

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.900
and you have the forest floor.
