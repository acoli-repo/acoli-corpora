00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.900
and you have the forest floor.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.685
Now, all of these parts of the forest

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.451
are made up of different plants,

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.869
and different animals call them home.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.180
So just like that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.972
is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:14.889
On top of that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.420
is responsible for all wound healing,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.175
so if you imagine cutting the body,

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.200
you actually have to rebuild

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.157
this very complex ECM

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:25.200
in order to get it to form again,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.779
and a scar, in fact, is actually

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.233
poorly formed extracellular matrix.
