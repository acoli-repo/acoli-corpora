00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.639
and reassemble them onto the wound.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.297
So if you have a bleeding 
wound like the one behind me,

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:06.870
you can actually put 
our material onto this,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.810
and just like Lego blocks,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.993
it'll reassemble into the local tissue.

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.859
So that means if you put it onto liver,

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.610
it turns into something 
that looks like liver,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.133
and if you put it onto skin,

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:18.236
it turns into something 
that looks just like skin.

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:19.616
So when you put the gel on,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.927
it actually reassembles 
into this local tissue.

00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:26.533
So now, this has a whole 
bunch of applications,

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.485
but basically the idea is,
wherever you put this product,

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.320
you're able to reassemble 
into it immediately.
