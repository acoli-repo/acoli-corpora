00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.893
for the military, but it's 
also a huge problem

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:33.875
that's epidemic throughout 
the entire medical field,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.506
which is how do we actually look at wounds

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:38.307
and how do we stop them quickly

00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:40.668
in a way that can work with the body?

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:43.481
So now, what I've been working
on for the last four years

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:46.476
is to develop smart biomaterials,

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.453
which are actually materials that will work

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.635
with the body, helping it to heal

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:54.995
and helping it to allow the 
wounds to heal normally.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:58.585
So now, before we do this, we 
have to take a much closer look

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.743
at actually how does the body work.
