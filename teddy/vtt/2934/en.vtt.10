00:04:58.914 --> 00:05:01.128
because there are other
species in the air;

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:03.200
in these excursions
towards the atmosphere,

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:04.387
we're not alone.

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:06.171
The air is full of clouds of life.

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:09.031
We live at the bottom of an ocean of air.

00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:11.268
And this same sculpture,

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:14.060
this exact one in my hands,

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.861
flew 375 miles -- 12 hours --
from Germany to Poland,

00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:18.063
on a fuel-free trip.

00:05:18.087 --> 00:05:20.240
But it wasn't free from crossing borders.

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:23.130
The trip was much more complicated
than what we imagined;

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:25.272
air space is as regulated and militarized

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:26.827
as land space.

00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:29.872
To fly using the winds,
the heat of the sun

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.634
and the radiant energy of the earth
