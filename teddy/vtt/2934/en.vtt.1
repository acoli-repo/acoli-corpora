00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:30.421
It was there that one night
I woke up from a dream,

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:33.329
and I saw that the stars
were also reflected on the water.

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:35.437
And that wasn't a dream.

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.274
It was as if you could walk
among the stars.

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:41.645
With every step I took,
the stars reverberated under my feet.

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:46.597
It was like I was floating in the universe
among clouds of galaxies.

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:50.983
But what's floating there today
are not just clouds of galaxies

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.189
but also clouds of plastic.

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:56.140
These are the footprints
we're leaving on the planet.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.006
They're signs of an era

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.984
in which the behavior of some humans
is making a global impact
