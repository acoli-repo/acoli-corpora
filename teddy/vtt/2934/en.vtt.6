00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.719
The difference in temperature
between the interior and the exterior

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.743
is what makes us rise up.

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:04.262
That way,

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:09.479
we don't use fossil fuels
or helium or hydrogen;

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:11.669
we don't use solar panels

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:13.693
or batteries or motors.

00:03:14.248 --> 00:03:19.538
We discovered a way that's simple,
clean and accessible to the whole world

00:03:19.562 --> 00:03:20.952
to lift ourselves up.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:25.706
I remember when I was at NASA in 2009
with 120 engineers.

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:28.995
You guys know, too,
when you go up in a plane,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.082
the control panels are gigantic.
