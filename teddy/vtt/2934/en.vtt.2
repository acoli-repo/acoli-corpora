00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.984
in which the behavior of some humans
is making a global impact

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.471
on our ecosystems.

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:08.870
This era is called the Anthropocene.

There's also another type
of toxic clouds that float in the air,

00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:15.964
like the ones that form
from carbon dioxide emissions

00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:19.427
and from the burning of fossil fuels --
oil, carbon, gas --

00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.641

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:25.874
I don't know about all of you,

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.510
but I've always dreamed of floating
among the clouds.

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:32.107
Maybe today we can imagine together
other types of clouds,
