00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.082
the control panels are gigantic.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:34.722
And what we're doing is really complex,

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.718
and when I started coming in
with the plastic bags, saying,

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:39.401
"But we have a different way ..."

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:41.765
people had a hard time
understanding the concept.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.333
Seeing the power of this idea,

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:44.996
we started to initiate a new era;

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.994
one that would leave behind
the violence of the Anthropocene

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:49.505
and give way to a new era,

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.599
which we call the "Aerocene" --

00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:54.439
an era of ecological awareness,

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.640
in which we learn to float together,
live together in the air,

00:03:57.664 --> 00:03:59.329
and come to an ethical commitment

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:01.501
with the atmosphere and with planet earth.
