00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.634
and the radiant energy of the earth

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.269
is complex and beautiful.

00:05:33.943 --> 00:05:36.317
But even more complex
will be getting the permits

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.381
to cross the air space
of each of the different countries

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.196
that we fly over using wind.

00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:45.597
At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,

00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:47.743
we presented these spherical sculptures

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:50.293
that could transport us
all over the world.

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:54.199
But how can we fly using the wind
to arrive at our destination?

00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:56.672
Together with MIT, we developed a program

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.776
that predicts how we can navigate
the wind highways.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.821
For example, if I had to return
to Berlin from Vancouver,
