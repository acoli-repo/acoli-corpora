00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:31.564
creating a huge canvas.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.588
We made a collection of drawings,

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:34.890
of personal stories

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:36.518
and of friendships.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.354
And when you join them,

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:40.378
bend them and fold them,

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.773
it creates a space full of air.

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.991
When the sun comes up from the horizon,

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.173
the museum rises up to the sky.

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.508
That's why we call it,
"The Aero-Solar Museum."

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:51.849
And from this simple idea,

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.760
we learned how to float in the air
in a radically new way,

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:57.004
without using any type of fuel.

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.719
The difference in temperature
between the interior and the exterior
