00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.315
For the first time in history,

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:33.497
we lifted a person into the air
using only the sun,

00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:36.294
without burning any fossil fuels.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:38.820
As the sun rose up above the horizon,

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.481
we rose up, too,

00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:42.169
silently,

00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:43.360
slowly,

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.890
with no explosions.

00:09:44.914 --> 00:09:47.550
We felt as if gravity had been inverted;

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.951
it wasn't pulling us
toward the center of the earth,

00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:52.679
but toward the universe.

00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:56.016
If Neil Armstrong said,
when he walked on the moon,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.806
"That's one small step for man,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.830
one giant leap for mankind,"
