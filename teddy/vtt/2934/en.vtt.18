Finally,

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.473
let me tell you one last story.

00:09:03.497 --> 00:09:05.671
On July 16, 1945,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.695
on the White Sands of New Mexico,

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:10.935
an atomic bomb was detonated
for the first time.

00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:13.311
As a result of this explosion,

00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:17.909
a cloud of radioactive particles
disseminated all over the earth,

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.802
marking the beginning
of the Anthropocene era.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.737
Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:26.315
in the same place,

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:27.723
another event occurred.

00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.315
For the first time in history,
