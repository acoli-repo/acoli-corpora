00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.599
So, what other features does it have?

00:04:31.623 --> 00:04:33.986
It has sensors that, when it moves,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.010
make sort of drawings in the air.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.693
It also has other sensors.

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:40.917
I always think that first
you have to feel it,

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:42.588
and then you can measure it;

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:45.325
you need to hear the sounds
of the atmosphere,

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.883
of the climate, of the hot air,

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:48.978
in order to then measure the ozone,

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.795
the carbon dioxide.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.360
We're developing these sensors

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.061
together with different communities
all over the world

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:58.890
in order to reconnect with the climate,
the temperature and the environment,

00:04:58.914 --> 00:05:01.128
because there are other
species in the air;
