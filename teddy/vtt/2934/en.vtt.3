Maybe today we can imagine together
other types of clouds,

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.914
clouds we can live with.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.171
If you're wondering
about that photo, I'll explain:

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:40.138
it looks like a collage
or photomontage -- something weird.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.518
No; it's reality.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.068
But sometimes I ask myself:
What is reality?

00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:45.761
According to Alexander Kluge:

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.349
"Human beings are not
interested in reality.

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:51.631
They can’t be; it’s part
of the human essence.

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:53.136
They have desires.

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.381
These desires are totally opposed
to any form of reality.

00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.097
They prefer to lie

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.314
than to become divorced
from their desires."
