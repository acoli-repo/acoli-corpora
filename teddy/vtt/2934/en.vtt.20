00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:02.631
perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:

00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:05.355
What steps do we need to take today?

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.811
In the Aerocene era,

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:11.505
our steps are much smaller,
but radically different;

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.252
they're steps that began with a bag
full of air and wishes,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.210
but that can carry us
to independence from fossil fuels

00:10:21.234 --> 00:10:23.243
and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:26.584
steps that won't leave footprints
on other planets

00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:30.859
until we've learned to walk
in the atmosphere of this one.
