00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:02.623
Imagine a scientist

00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:06.210
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place,

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.880
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.965
and perhaps inhospitable.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.553
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:18.890
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable,

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.727
instead, she sends
a robot-producing technology

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.272
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives,

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:29.609
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.652
to adapt to its new surroundings.
