00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.136
that fossil fuel use
contributes to global warming,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.856
conflicts with what we do --
drive, fly, eat beef --

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.200
then so-called
cognitive dissonance sets in.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.176
This is felt as an inner discomfort.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.760
We may feel like hypocrites.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.160
To get rid of this discomfort,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.136
our brain starts coming up
with justifications.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.176
So I can say, for instance,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.000
"My neighbor, he has
a much bigger car than I do."

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.296
Or, "Changing my diet
doesn't amount to anything

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.480
if I am the only one to do it."

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.376
Or, I could even want
to doubt climate science itself.
