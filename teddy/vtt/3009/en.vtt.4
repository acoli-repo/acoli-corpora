00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.336
Building on a rapidly growing body
of psychology and social science,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.336
I spent years looking
into the five inner defenses

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120
that stop people from engaging.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.616
When people hear news about the climate
coming straight at them,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.160
the first defense comes up rapidly:

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.480
distance.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.576
When we hear about the climate,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.696
we hear about something
far away in space --

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.376
think Arctic ice, polar bears --

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800
far away in time -- think 2100.
