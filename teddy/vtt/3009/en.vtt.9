00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.376
Or, I could even want
to doubt climate science itself.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.040
I could say, "You know,
climate is always changing."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.936
So these justifications
make us all feel better,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.576
but at the expense

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.696
of dismissing what we know.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.080
Thus, behavior drives attitudes.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.656
My personal cognitive dissonance comes up

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.016
when I recognize that I've been
flying from Oslo to New York

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.296
and back to Oslo

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.216
in order to speak about the climate.
