00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.256
So, after recognizing
how these five D's kill engagement,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.960
how can we move beyond them?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.816
New research shows
how we can flip these five defenses

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.976
over into key success criteria

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.440
for a more brain-friendly
climate communication.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.976
So this is where it gets really exciting

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.840
and where we find the five S's,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.920
the five evidence-based solutions
for what does work.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.920
First, we can flip distance to social.
