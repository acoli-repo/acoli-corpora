00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.536
How did these ways
of speaking make you feel?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.656
The first, detached maybe
or just confused?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.109
What's this guy talking about?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.360
The other, fearful or just numb?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.456
So again, the question I asked:

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.976
How do we get people engaged
in solving global warming?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.680
And why don't these two ways
of communicating work?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.336
You see, the biggest obstacle
to dealing with climate disruptions

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.960
lies between your ears.
