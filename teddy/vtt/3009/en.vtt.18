00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.496
we can make the climate-friendly behaviors

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.440
default and convenient.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.680
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.816
Food waste at buffets goes way down

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.416
if the plate or the box size
is reduced a little,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.696
because on the smaller plate it looks full

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.416
but in the big box it looks half empty,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.896
so we put more in.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.456
So smaller plates make
a big difference for food waste.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.176
And there are hundreds
of smart nudges like this.
