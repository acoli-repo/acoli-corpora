00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.416
Inside this thin,
fluctuating, unsettled film,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.240
all of life is nourished,
protected and held.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.376
It insulates and regulates temperatures

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.416
in a range that is just right
for water and for life as we know it,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.480
and mediating between
the blue ocean and black eternity,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.456
the clouds carry
all the billions of tons of water

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.680
needed for the soils.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.376
The air fills the rivers,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.016
stirs the waters,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.240
waters the forests.
