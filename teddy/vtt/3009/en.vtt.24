Climate isn't really
about some abstract, distant climate

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.256
far, far away from us.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.800
It's about this air that surrounds us.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.776
This air, you can feel in this room, too,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.640
the air that moves
right now in your nostrils.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.480
This air is our earth's skin.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.416
It's amazingly thin,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.096
compared to the size of the earth
and the cosmos it shields us from,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.616
far thinner than the skin of an apple

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.560
compared to its diameter.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.880
It may look infinite when we look up,
