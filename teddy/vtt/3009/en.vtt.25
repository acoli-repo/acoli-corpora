00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.880
It may look infinite when we look up,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.416
but the beautiful, breathable air
is only like five to seven miles thin,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.120
a fragile wrapping around a massive ball.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.496
Inside this skin,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.680
we're all closely connected.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.336
The breath that you just took

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.096
contained around 400,000
of the same argon atoms

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.120
that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime.
