It's huge and slow-moving --
think gigatons and centuries.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.440
So it's not here. It's not now.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.696
Since it feels so far away from me,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.400
it seems outside my circle of influence,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.416
so I feel helpless about it.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.800
There's nothing I can do.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.416
In our everyday lives,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.296
most of us prefer to think
about nearer things,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.536
such as our jobs, our kids,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.376
how many likes we get on Facebook.
