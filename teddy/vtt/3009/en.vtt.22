00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.776
And in Oslo, we can see
how enthusiastic EV owners

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.256
go and tell their electric stories
to friends and neighbors

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.576
and bring them along.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.470
So we come full circle
from story back to social.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.696
So thousands of climate communicators

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.136
are now starting to use these solutions

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.360
all over the world.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.016
It is clear, however,
that individual solutions

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.880
are not sufficient
to solving climate alone,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.680
but they do build
stronger bottom-up support
