00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.240
How do we get people engaged
in solving global warming?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.480
I'd like to start with running
two short experiments with you all.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.776
So your task is to notice
if you feel any difference as I speak.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
OK?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.320
Here we go.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.416
We are seeing rising
carbon dioxide levels,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.720
now about 410 ppms.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.816
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.320
we need rapid decarbonization.
