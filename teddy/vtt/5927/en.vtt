In May of 1822, 
Count Christian Ludwig von Bothmer

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.739
shot down a stork over his castle
grounds in North Germany.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:23.024
However, he wasnâ€™t the first person
to hunt that specific bird.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.064
Upon recovering the stork,

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:30.213
von Bothmer found it impaled 
by a yard long wooden spear.
