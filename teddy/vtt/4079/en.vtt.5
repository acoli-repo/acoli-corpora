00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.886
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission
sample the Martian atmosphere,

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:34.578
trying to understand how Mars
might have lost its past habitability.

00:02:34.578 --> 00:02:39.143
Private spaceflight companies now offer
not just a short trip to near space

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:42.844
but the tantalizing possibility
of living our lives on Mars.

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:44.794
But though these Martian vistas

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:47.349
resemble the deserts
of our own home world,

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.921
places that are tied in our imagination
to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.593
compared to Earth

00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:57.890
Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.164
Consider the extent to which
we have not colonized
