00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.928
But the goals of interplanetary
exploration and planetary preservation

00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:05.109
are not opposed to one another.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.640
No, they're in fact two sides
of the same goal:

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.982
to understand, preserve
and improve life into the future.

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:16.045
The extreme environments
of our own world are alien vistas.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.926
They're just closer to home.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:22.105
If we can understand how to create
and maintain habitable spaces

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:25.495
out of hostile, inhospitable
spaces here on Earth,

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:28.932
perhaps we can meet the needs
of both preserving our own environment

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:31.161
and moving beyond it.
