00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:31.161
and moving beyond it.

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:33.471
I leave you with a final
thought experiment:

00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:35.166
Fermi's paradox.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:40.028
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi
asked that, given the fact

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.875
that our universe has been around
for a very long time

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:45.545
and we expect that there
are many planets within it,

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:48.633
we should have found evidence
for alien life by now.

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:50.676
So where are they?

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:54.043
Well, one possible solution
to Fermi's paradox

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:57.526
is that, as civilizations become
technologically advanced enough

00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.848
to consider living amongst the stars,

00:04:59.848 --> 00:05:02.332
they lose sight of how important it is
