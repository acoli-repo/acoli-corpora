00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:32.434
that measures the subtle dimming of stars
as planets pass in front of them,

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:35.282
blocking just a little bit
of that light from reaching us.

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:38.332
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes

00:00:38.332 --> 00:00:41.118
as well as their distance
from their parent star.

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:45.158
Together, this helps us understand
whether these planets are small and rocky,

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.713
like the terrestrial planets
in our own Solar System,

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:51.079
and also how much light they receive
from their parent sun.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.957
In turn, this provides clues as to whether
these planets that we discover

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:57.418
might be habitable or not.

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:01.481
Unfortunately, at the same time
as we're discovering this treasure trove
