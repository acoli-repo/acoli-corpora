00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.416
We're at a tipping point in human history,

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:08.943
a species poised between gaining the stars
and losing the planet we call home.

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:12.062
Even in just the past few years,
we've greatly expanded

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.392
our knowledge of how Earth fits
within the context of our universe.

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:19.130
NASA's Kepler mission has discovered

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.079
thousands of potential planets
around other stars,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.273
indicating that Earth is but one
of billions of planets in our galaxy.

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:28.143
Kepler is a space telescope

00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:32.434
that measures the subtle dimming of stars
as planets pass in front of them,
