00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.002
that Mars will be there to save us
from the self-inflicted destruction

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:34.135
of the only truly habitable planet
we know of, the Earth.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.573
As much as I love
interplanetary exploration,

00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:38.918
I deeply disagree with this idea.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.611
There are many excellent reasons
to go to Mars,

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:45.025
but for anyone to tell you that Mars
will be there to back up humanity

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:48.133

telling you that the real party

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.504
is happening later on the lifeboats.

00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:53.453
(Laughter)

00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:56.355
(Applause)

00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:59.142
Thank you.

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.928
But the goals of interplanetary
exploration and planetary preservation
