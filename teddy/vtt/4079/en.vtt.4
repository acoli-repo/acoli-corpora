00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.572
between the newly discovered planet
and the planets we know best:

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:03.662
those of our own Solar System.

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:05.624
Consider our neighbor, Mars.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:09.409
Mars is small and rocky,
and though it's a bit far from the Sun,

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.934
it might be considered
a potentially habitable world

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.936
if found by a mission like Kepler.

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:17.303
Indeed, it's possible that Mars
was habitable in the past,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.740
and in part, this is why
we study Mars so much.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.130
Our rovers, like Curiosity,
crawl across its surface,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.380
scratching for clues as to the origins
of life as we know it.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.886
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission
sample the Martian atmosphere,
