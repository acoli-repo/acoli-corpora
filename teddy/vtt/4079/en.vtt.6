00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.164
Consider the extent to which
we have not colonized

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:03.068
the deserts of our own planet,

00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:05.901
places that are lush
by comparison with Mars.

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:08.687
Even in the driest,
highest places on Earth,

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:11.287
the air is sweet and thick with oxygen

00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:15.374
exhaled from thousands of miles away
by our rainforests.

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:21.318
I worry -- I worry that this excitement
about colonizing Mars and other planets

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:24.429
carries with it a long, dark shadow:

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.449
the implication and belief by some

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.002
that Mars will be there to save us
from the self-inflicted destruction
