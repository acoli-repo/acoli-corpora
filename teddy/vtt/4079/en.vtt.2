00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:01.481
Unfortunately, at the same time
as we're discovering this treasure trove

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.594
of potentially habitable worlds,

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:07.054
our own planet is sagging
under the weight of humanity.

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:11.466
2014 was the hottest year on record.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.809
Glaciers and sea ice that have
been with us for millennia

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:17.944
are now disappearing
in a matter of decades.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:23.055
These planetary-scale environmental 
changes that we have set in motion

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:26.527
are rapidly outpacing our ability
to alter their course.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:31.062
But I'm not a climate scientist,
I'm an astronomer.
