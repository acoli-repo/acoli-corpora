00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.697
So we had to use special protocols

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.510
to not contaminate the environment
with our presence,

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:36.709
and we tried also to share
with the community,

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.406
with the indigenous community,
our discoveries.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.986
And the caves represent, really,
a snapshot of the past.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:47.215
The time needed for their formation

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:52.163
could be as long as 50 or even
100 million years,

00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:57.088
which makes them possibly the oldest caves
that we can explore on earth.

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:04.648
What you can find there
is really evidence of a lost world.
