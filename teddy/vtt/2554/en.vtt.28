00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:00.642
FS: Yeah. They are working
in a darkroom, basically,

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.785
so you can open the shutter of the camera

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.227
and use the lights
to paint the environment.

00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:06.506
BG: So you're basically --

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.265
FS: Yes. You can even keep
the shutter open for one minute

00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:10.813
and then paint the environment.

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:13.541
The final result is what
you want to achieve.

00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:16.638
BG: You spray the environment with light
and that's what you get.

00:14:16.662 --> 00:14:19.104
Maybe we can try this at home
someday, I don't know.

00:14:19.128 --> 00:14:20.132
(Laughter)

00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:21.747
BG: Francesco, grazie.
FS: Grazie.

00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:24.999
