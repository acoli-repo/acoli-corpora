00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:34.286
Scientists consider those mountains
as islands in time,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.948
being separated
from the surrounding lowlands

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.656
since tens of millions of years ago.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.581
They are surrounded
by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:46.737
resembling a fortress,
impregnable by humans.

00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:49.975
And, in fact, only a few
of these mountains have been climbed

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.835
and explored on their top.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.609
These mountains contain also
a scientific paradox:

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.693
They are made by quartz,

00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:00.884
which is a very common mineral
on the earth's crust,
