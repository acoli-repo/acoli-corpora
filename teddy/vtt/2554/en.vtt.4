00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.473
can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.277
forming a drainage system
of tunnels, conduits --

00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.780
a three-dimensional network, actually.

00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:12.683
Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent
of the continents' surface,

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:17.831
and we know actually that speleologists
in the last 50 years

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:23.519
have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers
of cave passages around the world,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.911
which is a big number.

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:29.434
But geologists have estimated
that what is still missing,

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.688
to be discovered and mapped,
