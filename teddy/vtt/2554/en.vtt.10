00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:00.884
which is a very common mineral
on the earth's crust,

00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:05.286
and the rock made up by quartz
is called quartzite,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.618
and quartzite is one of the hardest
and least soluble minerals on earth.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:14.033
So we do not expect at all
to find a cave there.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.975
Despite this, in the last 10 years,
speleologists from Italy,

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.804
Slovakia, Czech Republic,
and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,

00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:25.807
have explored several caves in this area.

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:28.318
So how can it be possible?

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:32.403
To understand this contradiction,
we have to consider the time factor,
