00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:33.181
we will find probably clues
about the origin of life on our planet

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:36.182
and on the relationship
and evolution of life

00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:39.192
in relationship with the mineral world.

00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:43.158
What seems only a dark, empty environment

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:45.975
could be in reality a chest of wonders

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:48.479
full of useful information.

00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:53.975
With a team of Italian, Venezuelan
and Brazilian speleologists,

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:57.190
which is called La Venta Teraphosa,

00:11:57.214 --> 00:11:59.282
we will be back soon to Latin America,

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:04.754
because we want to explore other tepuis
in the farthest areas of the Amazon.
