00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:04.320
So whatever you find in the cave,
even a small cricket,

00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:08.312
has evolved in the dark
in complete isolation.

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:12.589
And, really, everything that you can feel
in the cave are real connections

00:11:12.613 --> 00:11:15.653
between the biological
and the mineralogical world.

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:22.360
So as we explore this dark continent

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:28.788
and discover its mineralogical
and biological diversity and uniqueness,

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:33.181
we will find probably clues
about the origin of life on our planet
