00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:04.754
because we want to explore other tepuis
in the farthest areas of the Amazon.

00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:07.798
There are still very unknown mountains,

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:12.516
like Marahuaca, which is almost
3,000 meters high above sea level,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.639
or Aracà, which is in the upper region
of Rio Negro in Brazil.

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:21.582
And we suppose that we could find there
even bigger cave systems,

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:26.294
and each one with its own
undiscovered world.

00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:27.810
Thank you.

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:33.288
