growing on a boulder.

And you can imagine our talks
when we were exploring the cave.

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:45.687
We were the first entering
and discovering those unknown things,

00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.549
things like those monster eggs.

00:09:48.573 --> 00:09:52.969
And we were a bit scared
because it was all a discovery,

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:55.076
and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.604
We didn't find a dinosaur.

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:58.225

00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:01.546
Anyway, actually, we know
that this kind of formation,
