What you can find there
is really evidence of a lost world.

00:09:05.301 --> 00:09:07.288
When you enter a quartzite cave,

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:10.760
you have to completely forget
what you know about caves --

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:13.781
classic limestone caves
or the touristic caves

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:16.162
that you can visit
in several places in the world.

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:19.111
Because what seems
a simple stalactite here

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:24.220
is not made by calcium carbonate,
but is made by opal,

00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:29.828
and one of those stalactites can require
tens of millions of years to be formed.
