And if we have a look at other planets
like, for example, Mars,

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.666
you will see that this characteristic

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.777
is not so specific of our home planet.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:19.975
However, I will show to you now
that we do not need to go to Mars

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.204

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.690
