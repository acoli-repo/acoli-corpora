00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:02.975
our perception of the inner
side of the planet

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.963
is in some ways skewed,

00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:07.439
as is that of the depth of the oceans

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.970
or of the upper atmosphere.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:18.052
However, since systematic cave exploration
started about one century ago,

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:22.447
we know actually that caves exist
in every continent of the world.

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.515
A single cave system,
like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.523
can be as long
as more than 600 kilometers.
