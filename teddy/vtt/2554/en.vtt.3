00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.523
can be as long
as more than 600 kilometers.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.377
And an abyss like Krubera Voronya,
which is in the Caucasus region,

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.179
actually the deepest cave
explored in the world,

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:42.524
can go as far as more than 2,000
meters below the surface.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:46.269
That means a journey of weeks
for a cave explorer.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.771
Caves form in karstic regions.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.975
So karstic regions are areas of the world

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.489
where the infiltrating water
along cracks, fractures,

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.473
can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,
