00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.688
to be discovered and mapped,

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.263
is something around 10 million kilometers.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.577
That means that for each meter
of a cave that we already know,

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.134
that we have explored,

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:45.552
there are still some tens of kilometers
of undiscovered passages.

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:48.491
That means that this is really
an endless continent,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:52.013
and we will never be able
to explore it completely.

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:56.093
And this estimation is made
without considering other types of caves,

00:02:56.117 --> 00:03:00.556
like, for example, inside glaciers
or even volcanic caves,
