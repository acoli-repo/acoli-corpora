Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.
Give me that to start so we don't forget.

00:12:37.073 --> 00:12:40.911
Francesco, you said we don't need
to go to Mars to find alien life,

00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:43.860
and indeed, last time we spoke,
you were in Sardinia

00:12:43.884 --> 00:12:46.127
and you were training European astronauts.

00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.625
So what do you, a speleologist,
tell and teach to the astronauts?

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:52.432
Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --
it's a program of training

00:12:52.456 --> 00:12:57.357
for not only European, but also NASA,
Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.

00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:00.909
So they stay in a cave
for about one week in isolation.
