00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:31.622
And I started with this passion
when I was really young

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:35.707
in the mountains not far
from my hometown in North Italy,

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:39.228
in the karstic regions of the Alps
and the Dolomites.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:43.093
But soon, the quest for exploration
brought me to the farthest corner

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:45.846
of the planet, searching
for new potential entrances

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.773
of this undiscovered continent.

00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:53.639
And in 2009, I had the opportunity
to visit the tepui table mountains,

00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:56.659
which are in the Orinoco
and Amazon basins.

00:03:56.683 --> 00:04:01.235
These massifs enchanted me
from the first time I saw them.
