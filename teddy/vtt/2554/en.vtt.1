00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.975
Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers
in the last three centuries --

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.833
actually, we know also thanks
to satellite technology, of course --

00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:39.061
we know almost every single square meter
of our planet's surface.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:44.026
However, we know still very little
about what is hidden inside the earth.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.975
Because a cave landscape,
like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.353
the potential of cave exploration --
the geographical dimension --

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.745
is poorly understood and unappreciated.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.804
Because we are creatures
living on the surface,

00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:02.975
our perception of the inner
side of the planet
