00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:32.403
To understand this contradiction,
we have to consider the time factor,

00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:35.730
because the history of the tepuis
is extremely long,

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:40.411
starting about 1.6 billion years ago
with the formation of the rock,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:46.975
and then evolving with the uplift
of the region 150 million years ago,

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.975
after the disruption
of the Pangaea supercontinent

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.352
and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:58.686
So you can imagine that the water had tens
or even hundreds of millions of years

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.768
to sculpt the strangest forms
on the tepuis' surfaces,
