00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:00.909
So they stay in a cave
for about one week in isolation.

00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:04.813
They have to work together
in a real, real dangerous environment,

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:08.647
and it's a real alien environment for them
because it's unusual.

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:12.975
It's always dark. They have to do science.
They have a lot of tasks.

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.531
And it's very similar to a journey to Mars

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:17.227
or the International Space Station.

00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:18.510
BG: In principle.
FS: Yes.

00:13:18.534 --> 00:13:20.611
BG: I want to go back
to one of the pictures

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:22.468
that was in your slide show,

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:24.881
and it's just representative
of the other photos --

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:27.203
Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?

00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:28.385
Audience: Yeah!

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:32.145
