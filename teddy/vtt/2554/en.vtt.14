00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.615
So we did several attempts
to reach this area,

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.401
by land and with a helicopter,

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:06.975
but it was really difficult
because -- you have to imagine

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:11.378
that these mountains are covered
by clouds most of the year, by fog.

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:12.775
There are strong winds,

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:17.381
and there are almost 4,000 millimeters
of rainfall per year,

00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:20.667
so it's really, really difficult
to find good conditions.

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:25.474
And only in 2013 we finally
landed on the spot

00:07:25.498 --> 00:07:27.992
and we started
the exploration of the cave.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:30.640
The cave is huge.
