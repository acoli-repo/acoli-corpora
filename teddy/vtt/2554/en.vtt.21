00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:30.096
in complete isolation
from the external surface,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.744
and without being in contact with humans.

00:10:32.768 --> 00:10:35.365
They have never been
in contact with humans.

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:38.456
So the implications
for science are enormous,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.482
because here you could find,
for example, microbes

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:47.458
that could be useful to resolve
diseases in medicine,

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:51.418
or you could find even a new kind
of material with unknown properties.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.501
And, in fact, we discovered in the cave
a new mineral structure for science,

00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:58.532
which is rossiantonite,
a phosphate-sulfate.

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:04.320
So whatever you find in the cave,
even a small cricket,
