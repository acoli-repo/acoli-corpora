00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:30.640
The cave is huge.

00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:34.491
It's a huge network under the surface
of the tepui plateau,

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:38.209
and in only ten days of expedition,

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.356
we explored more than 20 kilometers
of cave passages.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.777
And it's a huge network
of underground rivers,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:52.975
channels, big rooms,
extremely deep shafts.

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.023
So it's really an incredible place.

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.588
And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:04.873
That means, in the Pemón indigenous
language, "The House of the Gods."
