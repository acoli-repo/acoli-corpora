00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:01.546
Anyway, actually, we know
that this kind of formation,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.103
after several studies,

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.352
we know that these kinds of formations
are living organisms.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:12.810
They are bacterial colonies using silica
to build mineral structures

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:14.764
resembling stromatolites.

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:19.309
Stromatolites are some of the oldest
forms of life that we can find on earth.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.136
And here in the tepuis,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.843
the interesting thing is that these
bacteria colonies have evolved

00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:30.096
in complete isolation
from the external surface,
