00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about the election.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
voted for an African-American candidate for President.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He won 375 electoral votes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And he won about 70 million popular votes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
more than any other presidential candidate --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of any race, of any party -- in history.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Democrats really like seeing this transition here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --
