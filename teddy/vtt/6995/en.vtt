Hey, work lifers, this is J.J. Abrams,

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:04.871
we're trying something new
on the podcast today,

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:10.204
I am going to be conducting an interview
on the show and my guest is Adam Grant.

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:13.829
We're going be talking about his new book,
Think Again Automatical.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.329
Oh, JJ, it's great to hear your voice,
but this is my show.

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:19.663
I don't know if it is.

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:22.329
I can't just let you take my job
and ask all the questions.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.454
I'm insisting on asking
you some questions.

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.829
Can you promise me that I can
ask one Star Wars question?

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:30.496
Yes, you can ask anything
you want. You can ask.
