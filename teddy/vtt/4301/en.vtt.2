00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.013
I'm a professional investor
about half the day,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:03.560
the daylight half.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:05.355
I was paying close attention earlier,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.039
and I now know I need to have
10 hours sleep at night,

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:10.687
which is tricky, because last
night the show ended

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.718
about 12:30, and so I was, I got --

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:16.646
and that was in Santa Rosa,
so I got home a little late.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:20.319
I want you to understand,
I've been studying the technology world,

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:22.879
and things have already begun to change.

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:24.353
But they're changing in ways

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.303
that I see literally no
commentator referring to today.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.798
There are six things going on
that I'm going to focus on.
