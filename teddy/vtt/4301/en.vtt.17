WEBVTT

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:32.341
it opens it up for everybody on WordPress,

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.163
it opens it up for every band ...

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:39.588
Because suddenly, the ability to produce
a differentiated, highly compelling,

00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:42.946
value-added -- maybe
even monetizable -- product

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.336
will be there.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.628
And what's really interesting
is, thanks to Apple,

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.627
there's nothing that commoditizers
can do about you.

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:54.655
Apple may try to stop us,
but I don't think they will.

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.517
I think they're smarter than that.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:59.797
So the key point is, I don't know
where we're going to stop

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.519
as the pendulum swings back.
