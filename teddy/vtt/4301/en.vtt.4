00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.579
is: Windows is dying.

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:01.768

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.701

I mean no disrespect to Microsoft,

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:09.899
because I think, in fact, Microsoft
as a company has many things it can do

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:11.266
to maintain growth,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.006

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.192

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:25.129
is that smartphones have
basically taken Windows

00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:29.000
from 96% of internet-connected
devices 3 or 4 years ago,
