What I do is very simple:
I believe in full-contact investing.

00:12:00.757 --> 00:12:04.150
So I looked at HTML 5
about a year ago, and I said,

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.013
"This thing could be really important.
How do I find out?"

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.617
So my band, Moonalice,

00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.547
which, a couple years ago,
did an album with T Bone Burnett,

00:12:11.571 --> 00:12:15.002
that we thought was going to be
a huge hit and blah, blah, blah ...

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:19.545
Well, we learned that nobody cared about
hippie music done by old folks, so --

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:20.632
(Laughter)

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.557
So we put it all onto the net,
went on Facebook and Twitter.

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.772
We started doing things
called "Twittercasts,"

00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:28.432
the first live concerts
and then prerecorded concerts,

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.667
distributed over Twitter.

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:33.134
Then we started using live stream,
the same thing we're using here today,
