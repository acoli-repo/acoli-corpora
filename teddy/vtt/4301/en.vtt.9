00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:32.018
Realtor.com for finding a home,
Dictionary.com for words,

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.148
Wordnik for the whole language.

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:36.320
So the thing has really changed.

00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:37.797

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:55.503
the internet was an open-source,

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:58.481
long-tail world with no leader.

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:01.499
And Google stepped into this void,
provided leadership
