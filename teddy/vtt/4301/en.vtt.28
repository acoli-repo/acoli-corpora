you know, people's unwillingness
to be educated,

00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:07.728
this notion that we have to fall back
on ritual and beliefs, instead of facts.

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:11.369
But I think technology is finally
going to do us a favor.

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:16.913
I think it's finally going to give us
the tools to make us independent.

00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:18.645
And there's little glimmers, right?

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:20.386
We see the Arab Spring

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.768
and the impact that Twitter
and Facebook had.

00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:25.812
Pretty exciting.

00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:27.568
But imagine a world

00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:32.635
in which everything is an app.
