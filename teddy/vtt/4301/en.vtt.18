00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.519
as the pendulum swings back.

00:09:01.543 --> 00:09:05.092
But I think the days
of hypercommoditization are behind us.

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.001
And we can all play in this.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.331
In a moment I'm going to tell you
how I'm doing it personally.

00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:11.522
Tablets.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:14.842
This is the other side
of why Windows is dead.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.984
If any of you does not own an iPad --

00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:21.449
Look, I don't own any Apple stock,
so I have no axe in this,

00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:26.095
but seriously, if you don't own an iPad,
you cannot possibly understand

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:28.071
the most important things going on now.

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.151
(Laughter)

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:30.830
No, I'm really serious about this.
