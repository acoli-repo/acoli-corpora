00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.798
There are six things going on
that I'm going to focus on.

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.691
I want you to understand,
each one of these is a hypothesis;

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.568
it is subject to revision.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.953
It may even be subject to elimination.

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:39.328
But I want you to understand

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:42.769
I've been working with this group
of hypotheses now for about 10 months,

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:45.953
and what's really interesting
is that I've been exposing them

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:47.893
to a lot of people in the industry,

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.632
and people have been finding it
very hard to debunk them.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.678
So I'm going to share them with you today,

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:55.924
because I think collectively, we have
a chance of figuring this out.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.657
The first thing -- and I think
this is fairly obvious --

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.579
is: Windows is dying.
