But if you aren't really careful,
you can get mugged.

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.265
(Laughter)

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.720
And it is no shock

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.399
that each one of us
and everyone else out there

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:13.020
have looked for other ways to find
the things we want to find.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.855
We started with Wikipedia,

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.410
but then Facebook came along
for matters of taste and money;

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:20.372
Twitter came along for real-time news;

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.368
LinkedIn, for professional things;

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:25.005
Match.com, for less professional things;

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.848
TripAdvisor for travel,
Yelp for restaurants,

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:32.018
Realtor.com for finding a home,
Dictionary.com for words,
