Have you ever been in the position
of watching Silicon Valley take off

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.053
and wish that you had known
what was about to happen?

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.126
(Laughter)

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.928
So, I'm here to talk about
what I think is going to be

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:21.986
the most intense disruption
of the technology world

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.958
that's occurred in the last 15 years.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.047
And I believe the end product of it
will be entirely about engagement.
