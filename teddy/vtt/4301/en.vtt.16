WEBVTT

00:07:55.728 --> 00:08:00.085
is going to be between the App Store
and highly differentiated content.

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:03.712
If you don't know what HTML 5 is,
let me help you understand.

00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:05.389
It is a programming language.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.025
But it's a profound one.

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:09.945
Because for the first time,

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:12.821
you're going to be able
to construct a web page

00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:16.535
where the entire thing can have
embedded interactivity,

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.856
can have video, audio,
whatever it is that you want.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.840
But no more Flash boxes.

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:24.145
And it's a huge, huge change,

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.832
because it essentially
opens up a new canvas.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:29.873
And it doesn't just open it
up for The New York Times,

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:32.341
it opens it up for everybody on WordPress,
