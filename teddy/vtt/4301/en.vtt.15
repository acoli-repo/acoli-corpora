00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:30.652
to the absolute limit of commoditization,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.085
to the point where people
who spent their whole lives

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:37.606
developing really valuable,
compelling entertainment

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.664
and really valuable, compelling journalism

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:41.561
and really valuable, compelling novels,

00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:43.631
can't make money doing it anymore.

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:48.391
So the Web said, "OK,
if Google's over here, and Apple's here,

00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:52.062
HTML 5, the next generation, is going
to be on the other side of Apple."

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:55.704
So the new battle, instead of being
commoditization versus the App Store,

00:07:55.728 --> 00:08:00.085
is going to be between the App Store
and highly differentiated content.
