00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:30.593
not because index search is going away,
but because, like word processing,

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:33.340
it's gone from the most important
application we all had,

00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.352
to just another thing we do.

00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:38.176
And you see this in mobile in particular.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.958
Because in mobile, people have found
other ways to find what they want.

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:45.987
Index search is too disruptive
on a cell phone,

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.967
so the rate of index search
is a small fraction on cell phones

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.511
to what it is on desktops.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:56.266
And that is the leading indicator
that Google's recovery, if you will,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.637
will be in something other than search.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.295
The third hypothesis I have
is no longer controversial,
