So if you do a start-up today

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.527

00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:37.373
But the most important piece
of advice is: forget social.

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.566
Social is now a feature,
it's not a platform.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.914

00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:44.473

It's all about engagement.

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:51.862
The future is going to be different.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.021
And the core question is:

00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:56.022
What are we all going to do about it?

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:00.235
What I do is very simple:
I believe in full-contact investing.
