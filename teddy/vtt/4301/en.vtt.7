00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.054
Now, you may not have focused on this,

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:35.378
but index search accounted for
90% of all search volume

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.599
about 4 years ago.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:39.884
But an interesting thing happened.

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:45.906
Google got to be so successful
that the index became full of garbage.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.519
In fact, the entire Web
has become full of garbage.

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:53.591
If you think about it, the Web has become
almost a digital Detroit.

00:03:53.615 --> 00:03:54.682
(Laughter)

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.114
If you look hard enough,

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:58.942
you can find really
compelling things there.
