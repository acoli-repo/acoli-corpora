00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:33.134
Then we started using live stream,
the same thing we're using here today,

00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:35.262
to do internet-based
live video of our shows.

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:38.147
And then recently, we bought
a satellite network.

00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.425
Why? 'Cause it cost less than three months
of what our manager used to cost.

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:43.472
(Laughter)

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.577
And right now, we broadcast
every one of our shows --

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.958
other than the U2 show --

00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:50.642
live, in HTML 5,

00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.220
via satellite,

00:12:52.244 --> 00:12:54.348
in a system we totally control.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.174
We have an app that's about to ship
within the next month.
