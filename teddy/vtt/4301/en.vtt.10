And Google stepped into this void,
provided leadership

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:02.984
and implemented a strategy

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:07.104
that systematically commoditized
all forms of content.

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:11.052
And the simplest way to look at it
is to look at a Google results page:

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:14.461
the only logo on that page is Google's;

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.371
everything else is in the same font.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.499
That form of commoditization
has been tremendous for Google

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:22.807
and horrible for almost everyone else.

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.132
And I believe, to a first
order, it is over --

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:30.593
not because index search is going away,
but because, like word processing,
