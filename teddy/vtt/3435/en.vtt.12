in contrast to always looking to America

when there is quite

So in SMART,

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:11.125
apart from the goal that we have,
to develop a malaria vaccine,

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.594
we are also training African scientists,

00:06:13.618 --> 00:06:16.847
because the burden
of disease in Africa is high,

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:20.834
and you need people who will continue

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:22.516
in science, in Africa.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.586
SA: Yes, yes, correct.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.801
(Applause)

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:29.601

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.379
Tell me, I know you
mentioned this a little bit,
