They get the infection,
but they don't get ill.

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:36.307
The recipe is encoded in antibodies.

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.887
My team went back to our complex parasite,

00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:45.839
probed it with samples from Africans
who had overcome malaria

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:47.688
to answer the question:

00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:51.759
"What does a successful
antibody response look like?"

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.514
We found over 200 proteins,

00:01:55.538 --> 00:01:59.751
many of which are not
on the radar for malaria vaccines.
