00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:32.442
whether antibodies to the protein
would predict who got malaria

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:33.712
and who did not.

00:02:34.323 --> 00:02:36.426
In the past 30 years,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.228
these studies have tested
a small number of proteins

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:43.624
in relatively few samples

00:02:43.648 --> 00:02:46.315
and usually in single locations.

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:49.861
The results have not been consistent.

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:57.037
My team essentially collapsed
30 years of this type of research

00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.002
into one exciting experiment,
conducted over just three months.
