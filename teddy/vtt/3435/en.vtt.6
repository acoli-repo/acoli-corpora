00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.002
into one exciting experiment,
conducted over just three months.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.831
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samples

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:11.268
from 15 locations
in seven African countries,

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:15.514
spanning time, age
and the variable intensity

00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:18.220
of malaria experienced in Africa.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:24.244
We used omics intelligence
to prioritize our parasite proteins,

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.268
synthesize them in the lab

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:31.096
and in short, recreated
the malaria parasite on a chip.
