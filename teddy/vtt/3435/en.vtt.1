00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:30.458
We've been working at it
for 100 plus years.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.556
When we started, technology was limited.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:41.847
We could see just a tiny fraction
of what the parasite really looked like.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.831
Today, we are awash with technology,

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.910
advanced imaging and omics platforms --

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:54.144
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.493
These tools have given us a clearer view

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.810
of just how complex
the parasite really is.
