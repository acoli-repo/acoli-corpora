Tell me, I know you
mentioned this a little bit,

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:35.657
but how would things actually change
if there were a malaria vaccine?

00:06:36.732 --> 00:06:40.470
FO: We would save
half a million lives every year.

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:43.082
Two hundred million cases.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:49.914
It's estimated that malaria costs Africa
12 billion US dollars a year.

00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:51.674
So this is economics.

00:06:51.698 --> 00:06:53.966
Africa would simply thrive.

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:56.127
SA: OK. Thank you, Faith.

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:57.349
Thank you so much.
