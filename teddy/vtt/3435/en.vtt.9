against multiple parasite proteins.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:37.688
We're also learning that antibodies
kill the parasite in multiple ways,

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:43.656
and studying any one of these in isolation
may not adequately reflect reality.

00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:48.930
Just like we can now see the parasite
in greater definition,

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.946
my team and I are focused

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.707
on understanding how our bodies
overcome this complexity.

00:04:56.012 --> 00:05:00.449
We believe that this could provide
the breakthroughs that we need
