00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:01.314
The recipe behind a successful
antibody response,

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:05.703
so that we can predict
what might make a good malaria vaccine.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.553
We're also trying to figure out

00:04:08.577 --> 00:04:12.124
exactly what antibodies
do to the parasite.

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:14.037
How do they kill it?

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:17.783
Do they attack from multiple angles?
Is there synergy?

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.807
How much antibody do you need?

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:26.077
Our studies suggest that having
a bit of one antibody won't be enough.

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.641
It might take high
concentrations of antibodies

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.181
against multiple parasite proteins.
