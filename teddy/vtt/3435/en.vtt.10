00:04:56.012 --> 00:05:00.449
We believe that this could provide
the breakthroughs that we need

00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:04.209
to make malaria history
through vaccination.

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.870
Thank you.

00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:07.597
(Applause)

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.017
(Cheers)

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:15.793
(Applause)

00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:19.304
Shoham Arad: OK, how close
are we actually to a malaria vaccine?

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.138
Faith Osier: We're just
at the beginning of a process

00:05:23.162 --> 00:05:27.146
to try and understand
what we need to put in the vaccine

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.703
before we actually start making it.

00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:33.560
So, we're not really close to the vaccine,
but we're getting there.
