00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:10.746
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:14.038
we once thought only we were capable of.

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:18.288
Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.871
transcribe speech in dozens of languages,

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:24.454
and instantly identify almost any object.

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:27.079
But the robots of tomorrow may go futher

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.746
by learning to figure out
what we are feeling.
