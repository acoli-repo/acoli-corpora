00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you to take a trip with me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Picture yourself driving

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
down a small road in Africa,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and as you drive along, you look off to the side,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and this is what you see:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you see a field of graves.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And you go into the town,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and you inquire, "What's going on here?"

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then someone says,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
HIV isn't like other medical conditions;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's stigmatizing.
