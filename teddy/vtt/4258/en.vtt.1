ancient civilizations would record things

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:35.609
by notches on bones
or rocks or what have you.

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:40.299
The first books as we know them
originated in ancient Rome.

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:42.269
We go by a term called the codex,

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:44.669
where they would have
two heavy pieces of wood

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:45.940
which become the cover,

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:50.279
and then the pages in between
would then be stitched along one side

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:54.199
to make something that was relatively
easily transportable.

00:00:54.223 --> 00:00:56.649
They all had to completely
be done by hand,

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.399
which became the work
of what we know as a scribe.

00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:02.609
And frankly, they were luxury items.
