The book itself, you know,
can't be turned off with a switch.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.909
It's a story that you can
hold in your hand

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.296
and carry around with you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.449
and that's part of what makes
them so valuable,

00:03:08.473 --> 00:03:12.542
and I think will make them valuable
for the duration.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.562
A shelf of books, frankly,

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:16.459
is made to outlast you, (Laughs)

00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:17.923
no matter who you are.
