and it's like a dialogue
that you have with the author.

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:35.815
I think you have a much more human
relationship to a printed book

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.739
than you do to one that's on a screen.

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:42.419
People want the experience of holding it,

00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:46.729
of turning the page,
of marking their progress in a story.

00:02:46.753 --> 00:02:50.305
And then you have, of all things,
the smell of a book.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.489
Fresh ink on paper
or the aging paper smell.

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:56.999
You don't really get that
from anything else.

00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:01.059
The book itself, you know,
can't be turned off with a switch.
