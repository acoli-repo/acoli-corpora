that was unlike anything
that people had before.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.079
And you could argue
that it's still the best way

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.493
to deliver that to an audience.

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:10.109
I believe that the core purpose
of a physical book

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.209
is to record our existence

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:18.706
and to leave it behind
on a shelf, in a library, in a home,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.919
for generations down the road
to understand where they came from,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.359
that people went through
some of the same things

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:28.699
that they're going through,

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:31.933
and it's like a dialogue
that you have with the author.
