And frankly, they were luxury items.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:06.069
And then a printer
named Johannes Gutenberg,

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:11.763
in the mid-fifteenth century,
created the means to mass-produce a book,

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.449
the modern printing press.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.763
It wasn't until then

00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:19.269
that there was any kind of consumption
of books by a large audience.

00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:24.269
Book covers started to come into use
in the early nineteenth century,

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.669
and they were called dust wrappers.

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:28.839
They usually had advertising on them.

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:31.319
So people would take them off
and throw them away.
