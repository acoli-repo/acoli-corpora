00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:00.853
it's important as a person,

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:02.385
it's important as a country,

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.799
it's important as a people.

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:06.894
So I read a lot about where
the music comes from

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:08.539
and where this country comes from.

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:10.687
I've been reading a lot
about the Civil War

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:11.895
and about slavery.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.546
And it's really tough.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.724
You know?

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:16.000
It's really tough reading.

00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:18.544
And so as an artist,
what I do with all that emotion,

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:20.158
reading these people's stories,

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:21.991
not just, "Oh, slavery was terrible."

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.321
Yes, it was.

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:28.273
But it's reading individual narratives
of how it was for these people.

00:04:28.297 --> 00:04:29.456
You know?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.812
Then it's like, "Yeah,
that could've been me."
