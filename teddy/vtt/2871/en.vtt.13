00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:36.766
When I was 16, found my bloom

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.248
and found my man,

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:39.818
we jumped the broom.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:42.896
We pledged each other
the rest of our lives

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.333
and on Saturday nights
we were man and wife.

00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:48.013
Come love come,

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:49.675
the road lies low,

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.408
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:54.501
Come love come,

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:56.117
the road lies free,

00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.897
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.800
