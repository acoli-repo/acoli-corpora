Thank you.

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:41.379
That was a song based on
numerous work songs,

00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:43.442
and it was arranged by Odetta,

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.695
a hero of mine.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.817
And this next song, well,

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.021
I do a lot of historical music,

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:52.067
starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.317
and continuing on in my solo endeavors.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.000
And I believe that knowing
your history as a musician

00:03:58.024 --> 00:03:59.224
is super important --

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:00.853
it's important as a person,
