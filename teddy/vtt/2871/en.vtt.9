00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.812
Then it's like, "Yeah,
that could've been me."

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.530
And it is people now. You know?

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:35.293
So what you do with all that emotion

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.150
is you've got to do something with it.

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.327
As an artist, I write.

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.470
So I wrote a song based on
some of those narratives that I read,

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:43.561
and it's called, "Come Love Come."

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.621
We're going to do it for you now.

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:53.241
(Claps)

00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:56.704
(Sings) Come love come,

00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:58.288
the road lies low,

00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:01.556
the way is long and hard, I know.
