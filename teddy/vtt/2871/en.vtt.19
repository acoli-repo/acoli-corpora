00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:32.655
Thank you.

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:36.542
So, with the dark
you have to have the light.

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:39.108
And in the African-American community,

00:09:39.132 --> 00:09:41.353
it's been the work of many
hundreds of years

00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:43.463
to find a way to lift ourselves up.

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:47.750
So I'm going to end with a couple
of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:50.785
one of the more influential
American music figures

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:52.835
that most of you probably never heard of.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.975
If you have, I'm so happy.

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:57.463
She's one of the innovators
of rock 'n' roll guitar,

00:09:57.487 --> 00:10:01.116
and one of the first crossover artists
from gospel to secular.
