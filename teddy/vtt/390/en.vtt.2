00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.895
of being invited to come here
to talk about water.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.768
The words "water" and "dry"
do not match, right?

00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:10.916
It is even better to talk about
water in the Amazon,

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:15.950
which is the splendid cradle 
of life. Fresh life.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.028
So this is what inspired me.

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.230
That's why I'm here,
although I'm carrying

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.143
my head over here.

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:26.237
I am trying, or will try to convey
this inspiration.

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:30.097
I hope this story will inspire you
and that you'll spread the word.
