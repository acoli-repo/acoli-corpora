00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:33.522
Above the Amazon, there is clean air,

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:35.440
as there is clean air above the ocean.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.493
The blue sea has clean air above it
and forms pretty few clouds;

00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:39.952
there's almost no rain there.

00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:44.366
The green ocean has the same clean air,
but forms a lot of rain.

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:46.753
What is happening here that is different?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.423
The forest emits smells,

00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:51.361
and these smells are condensation nuclei,

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:53.625
which form drops in the atmosphere.

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:58.503
Then, clouds are formed
and there is torrential rain.

00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:01.180
The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.
