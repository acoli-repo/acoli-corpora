There is an exception, and it's curious:

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.520
It's the quadrangle that ranges from

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.323
and from São Paulo to the Andes.

00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:14.437
This quadrangle

It's on the line of deserts.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:20.010
Why isn't it? That's why

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.449

that is different?

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.448
If we could use the analogy

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:30.580
of the blood circulating in our bodies,
