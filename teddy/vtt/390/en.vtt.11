00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:31.375
In one day.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.562
Do you know how much that is?

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:36.122
The Amazon River,
the largest river on Earth,

00:05:36.122 --> 00:05:37.703
one fifth of all the fresh water

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:41.152
that leaves the continents of the
whole world and ends up in the oceans,

00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:45.562
dumps 17 billion metric tons
of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:46.811
This river of vapor

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.706
that comes up from the forest
and goes into the atmosphere

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.310
is greater than the Amazon River.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.187
Just to give you an idea.

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.743
If we could take a gigantic kettle,

00:05:56.743 --> 00:05:59.642
the kind you could plug into
a power socket, an electric one,

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.140
and put those 20 billion
metric tons of water in it,
