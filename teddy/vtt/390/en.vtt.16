which originates in the blue sea,

00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:06.247
which flows through the green ocean --

00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:09.244
it not only flows, but it is also
pumped by the green ocean --

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:12.299
and then it falls on our land.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:14.507
All our economy, that quadrangle,

00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:19.037
70 percent of South America's 
GDP comes from that area.

It depends on this river.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.727
This river flows invisibly above us.

00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:27.870

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.259
It's a bit dry and rough,
but we are floating here,
