00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.224
the smoke stops the rain, 
it stops raining,

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:32.426
the forest dries up and catches fire.

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.057
There is another fractal analogy.

00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:37.009
Like in the veins and arteries,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.805
the rain water is a feedback.

00:11:39.805 --> 00:11:41.834
It returns to the atmosphere.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:46.120
Like endocrinal glands and hormones,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.863
there are those gases
which I told you about before,

00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:52.495
that are formed and released
into the atmosphere, like hormones,

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:54.810
which help in the formation of rain.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.435
Like the liver and the kidneys,
as I've said, cleaning the air.

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:01.234
And, finally, like the heart:
