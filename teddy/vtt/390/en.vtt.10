00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.262
They use sunlight to do this process.

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:04.793
So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,

00:05:04.793 --> 00:05:07.723
a big tree manages
to transfer 1,000 liters of water

00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:10.032
through its transpiration --

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.447
1,000 liters.

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:16.642
If we take all the Amazon,

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:18.505
which is a very large area,

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:21.785
and add it up to all that water
that is released by transpiration,

00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:24.291
which is the sweat of the forest,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.985
we'll get to an incredible number:

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:29.781
20 billion metric tons of water.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:31.375
In one day.
