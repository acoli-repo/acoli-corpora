00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.140
and put those 20 billion
metric tons of water in it,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.490
how much power would you need
to have this water evaporated?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.247
Any idea? A really big kettle.

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:10.432
A gigantic kettle, right?

00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:12.518
50 thousand Itaipus.

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:16.264
Itaipu is still the largest
hydroelectric plant in the world.

00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:17.937
and Brazil is very proud of it

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:20.136
because it provides more 
than 30 percent of the power

00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:22.093
that is consumed in Brazil.

00:06:22.093 --> 00:06:26.785
And the Amazon is here,
doing this for free.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:31.957
It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,
providing environmental services.
