00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:01.715
which is another ingenious cycle.

00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:05.569
Speaking of fractals,

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:07.905
and their relation with the way we work,

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:10.493
we can establish other comparisons.

00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:14.024
As in the upper airways of our lungs,

00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:17.736
the air in the Amazon
gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.

00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:21.714
The dust in the air that we breathe
is cleaned by our airways.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:25.533
This keeps the excess of dust
from affecting the rainfall.

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:27.380
When there are fires in the Amazon,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.224
the smoke stops the rain, 
it stops raining,
