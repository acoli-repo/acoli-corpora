00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.906
But we have something
that plays the same role,

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:36.298
with much more elegance though:

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:39.194
the trees, our good old friends

00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:42.008
that, like geysers,

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:47.086
can transfer an enormous amount of water
from the ground into the atmosphere.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:52.783
There are 600 billion trees
in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.

00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:56.646
That is done with
an extraordinary sophistication.

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:58.291
They don't need the heat of magma.

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.262
They use sunlight to do this process.
