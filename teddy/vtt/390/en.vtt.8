00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.031
What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert,

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:07.277
what phenomenon makes water
gush from the ground into the atmosphere

00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:10.360
with such power 
that it can be seen from space?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.902
What phenomenon is this?

00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:14.770
It could be a geyser.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.558
A geyser is underground water
heated by magma,

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.998
exploding into the atmosphere

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:23.668
and transferring this water 
into the atmosphere.

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:26.534
There are no geysers in the Amazon,
unless I am wrong.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:28.502
I don't know of any.

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.906
But we have something
that plays the same role,
