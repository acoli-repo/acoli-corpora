00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:30.654
and let's now talk about
another function: the liver!

00:10:30.654 --> 00:10:35.715
When humid air, high humidity
and radiation are combined

00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:37.775
with these organic compounds,

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:43.487
which I call exogenous vitamin C,
generous vitamin C in the form of gas,

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:46.317
the plants release antioxidants

00:10:46.317 --> 00:10:48.637
which react with pollutants.

00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:50.041
You can rest assured

00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.538
that you are breathing the purest air
on Earth, here in the Amazon,

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:57.045
because the plants take care
of this characteristic as well.

00:10:57.045 --> 00:10:59.662
This benefits the very way plants work,

00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:01.715
which is another ingenious cycle.
