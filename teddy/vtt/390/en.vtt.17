00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.259
It's a bit dry and rough,
but we are floating here,

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.349
and there is this
invisible river running above us.

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:37.516
This river has a pulse.

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:39.939
Here it is, pulsing.

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:42.327
That's why we also talk about the heart.

00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:44.462
You can see the different seasons there.

00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:47.823
There's the rainy season. In the Amazon,
we used to have two seasons,

00:08:47.823 --> 00:08:50.306
the humid season
and the even more humid season.

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:51.962
Now we have a dry season.

00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:54.671
You can see the river covering that region

00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:58.444
which, otherwise, would be a desert.
And it is not.
