save other areas,

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:02.172
including deserts.

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:05.597
If we could establish forests
in those other areas,

00:14:05.597 --> 00:14:07.709
we can reverse climate change,

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.324
including global warming.

00:14:10.324 --> 00:14:12.540
I have a dear colleague in India,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.614
whose name is Suprabha Seshan,
and she has a motto.

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:19.928
Her motto is,
"Gardening back the biosphere,"

00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:22.286
"Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:25.284
She does a wonderful job
rebuilding ecosystems.

00:14:25.284 --> 00:14:27.851
We need to do this.

00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.036
