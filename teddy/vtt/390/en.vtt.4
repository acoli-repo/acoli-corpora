00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:01.913
you'll be amazed at the --

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.957
You can barely see the animals.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:08.011
The Indians say, "The forest
has more eyes than leaves."

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.987
That is true, and I will try
to show you something.

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:14.168
But today, I'm going to use
a different approach,

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.188
one that is inspired by these
two initiatives here,

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.869
a harmonic one and a philosophical one.

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.998
I'll try to use an approach
that's slightly materialistic,

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.216
but it also attempts to convey
that, in nature, there is

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:30.310
extraordinary philosophy and harmony.
