00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:31.184
and after a scientist
who became a philosopher,

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.126
I have to talk about hard science.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:36.154
It could be a very dry subject.

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:39.679
Yet, I feel honored.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.462
Never in my career,

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.023
and it's been a long career,

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.256
have I had the opportunity to start a talk

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.264
feeling so inspired, like this one.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:52.144
Usually, talking about science

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:55.304
is like exercising in a dry place.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.516
However, I've had the pleasure

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.895
of being invited to come here
to talk about water.
