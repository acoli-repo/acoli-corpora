00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:31.957
It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,
providing environmental services.

00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.608
Related to this subject,

00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:38.596
we are going to talk about
what I call the paradox of chance,

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.764
which is curious.

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:42.476
If you look at the world map --

00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:43.835
it's easy to see this --

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.904
you'll see that there are forests
in the equatorial zone,

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:50.116
and deserts are organized
at 30 degrees north latitude,

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:53.199
30 degrees south latitude, aligned.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.243
Look over there, in the southern
hemisphere, the Atacama;

00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:58.840
Namibia and Kalahari in Africa;
the Australian desert.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.994
In the northern hemisphere,
the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.
