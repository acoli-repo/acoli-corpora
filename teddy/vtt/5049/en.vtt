“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here… ”

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.494
Inscribed above the Gate of Hell,

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:17.224
these ominous words warn dark 
tidings for Dante

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:20.924
as he begins his descent into inferno.

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:22.914
Yet despite the grim tone,

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:28.204
this prophecy sets into motion what is 
perhaps the greatest love story ever told;

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:32.684
an epic journey that encompasses both 
the human and the divine.
