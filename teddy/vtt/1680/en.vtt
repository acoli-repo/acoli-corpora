00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:03.304
Let me tell you a story.

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:05.103
It goes back 200 million years.

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:07.087
It's a story of the neocortex,

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:09.061
which means "new rind."

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:11.492
So in these early mammals,

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:13.547
because only mammals have a neocortex,

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:15.211
rodent-like creatures.

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.790
It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.229
and was a thin covering around

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.493
their walnut-sized brain,

00:00:22.493 --> 00:00:26.194
but it was capable of a new type of thinking.

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:27.761
Rather than the fixed behaviors

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.753
that non-mammalian animals have,

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:32.445
it could invent new behaviors.
