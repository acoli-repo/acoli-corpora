00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:33.281
and I thought, as an 18-year-old
with a happy life, it was too normal,

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:37.007
but I could create these worlds
where I could talk about my experiences

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.331
and dreams and beliefs.

00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:41.326
So it's amazing to be here
in front of you today.

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:42.742
Thank you for being here.

00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.019
If you weren't here,

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:46.759
it would be pretty much

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.826
(Laughter)

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:51.403
And this is more fun.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.563
So this last one is called
"The Sunshine Kid."

00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:56.697
Thank you very much for listening.

00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:00.087
Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,
