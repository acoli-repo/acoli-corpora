And somehow, I won, which was great,

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:35.849

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.892
but it also means that this next piece

00:05:37.892 --> 00:05:41.375
is technically the best poem in the world.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:45.369
(Laughter)

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:46.785
So...

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:51.638
(Applause)

00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:54.633
According to five French strangers.

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:58.557
So this is "Paper People."

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.636
I like people.
