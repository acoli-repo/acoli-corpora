00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.197
Sure enough after two months
of moping around,

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:04.649
61 days later, 61 was who he found,

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.871
He had lost his keys 
and his parents were out.

00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.993
So one day after school 
he went into a house

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:11.506
As he noticed the slightly wonky
numbers on the door,

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.991
He wondered why he’d never
introduced himself before,

00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:16.119
As she let him in, his jaw 
dropped in awe.

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.308
61 was like 60, but a little bit more.
(Laughter)

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:22.710
She had prettier eyes,
and an approachable smile,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.136
And like him, rough around
the edges, casual style,

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.512
And like him, everything
was in disorganized piles,

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:30.345
And like him, her mum didn’t mind
if friends stayed a while.
