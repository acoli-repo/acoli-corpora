00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.636
I like people.

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.992
I'd like some paper people.

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:06.173
They’d be purple paper people.
Maybe pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:08.913
Proper pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:11.839
"How do you prop up
pop-up purple paper people?"

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.253
I hear you cry. Well I ...

00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:17.011
I’d probably prop up proper
pop-up purple paper people

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:20.662
with a proper pop-up
purple people paperclip,

00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:23.399
but I’d pre-prepare appropriate
adhesives as alternatives,

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.171
a cheeky pack of Blu Tack
just in case the paper slipped.

00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:28.254
Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:31.135
but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the
paper people politics.
