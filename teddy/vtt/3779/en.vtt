00:00:00.646 --> 00:00:03.964
My name is Harry Baker.
Harry Baker is my name.

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:08.867
If your name was Harry Baker,
then our names would be the same.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.307
(Laughter)

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:12.494
It's a short introductory part.

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:14.486
Yeah, I'm Harry.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.063
I study maths. I write poetry.

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:21.266
So I thought I'd start
with a love poem about prime numbers.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.915
(Laughter)

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.281
This is called "59."

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.171
I was going to call it
"Prime Time Loving."

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.071
That reaction is why I didn't.
