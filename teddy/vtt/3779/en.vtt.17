00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:30.417
People like my aunt who puts on
plays with prisoners.

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.601
People who are capable
of genuine forgiveness.

00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.520
People like the persecuted Palestinians.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.174
People who go out of their way
to make your life better,

00:08:37.174 --> 00:08:38.868
and expect nothing in return.

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.043
You see, people have potential
to be powerful.

00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:44.198
Just because the people in power
tend to pretend to be victims

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:46.250
we don’t need to succumb to that system.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.595
And a paper population is no different.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:52.313
There’s a little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:54.941
And in a pop-up population
people's problems pop up too,

00:08:54.941 --> 00:08:58.324
but even if the whole world fell apart
then we’d still make it through.

00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:00.785
Because we’re people.
