00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:00.103
Designed to remind him
he wasn’t very cool

00:11:00.103 --> 00:11:02.587
And he didn’t fit in with any
popular kids at school.

00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:06.152
They said his head was up in space
and they would bring him down to Earth,

00:11:06.152 --> 00:11:09.143
Essentially he came from nothing
and that is what he was worth,

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.277
He’d never get to go
to university to learn,

00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:14.046
Only degrees he’d ever show
would be the first degree burns

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.754
From those that came too close,

00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:17.342
they told him he was too bright,

00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:19.519
That’s why no one ever
looked him in the eyes,

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.991
His judgment became clouded

00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:22.915
So did the sky,
With evaporated tears

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.158
as the sun started to cry.

00:11:24.158 --> 00:11:29.405
Because the sunshine kid was bright,
with a warm personality,

00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:31.332
And inside he burned savagely
