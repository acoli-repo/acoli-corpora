00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:31.332
And inside he burned savagely

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:33.701
Hurt by the words and curses
of the shadowy folk

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:36.278
who spoke holes in his soul
and left cavities,

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:40.016
And as his heart hardened,
his spark darkened,

00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:42.600
Every time they called him names
it cooled his flames,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.277
He thought they might like him
if he kept his light dim

00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:48.468
But they were busy telling lightning
she had terrible aim,

00:11:48.468 --> 00:11:51.254
He couldn’t quite get to grips
with what they said,

00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:54.096
So he let his light be eclipsed
by what they said,

00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:56.235
He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:58.661
And felt like he’d been punched
in his solar plexus.

00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:02.718
But that’s when
Little Miss Sunshine came along
