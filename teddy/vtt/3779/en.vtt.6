00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.879
And from that moment on
there was nonstop chatter,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.354
How they loved "X Factor,"
how they had two factors,

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:08.454
How that did not matter,
distinctiveness made them better,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.239
By the end of the night they knew
they were meant together.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.213
And one day she was talking
about stuck-up 60,

00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:16.140
She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.837
He blushed, told her of his crush:

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:20.604
“The best thing that never happened
because it led to us.”

00:03:20.604 --> 00:03:23.446
61 was clever, see,
not prone to jealousy,

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:26.148
She looked him in the eyes
and told him quite tenderly,

00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:31.140
"You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combine
to become twice what 60 could ever be."
