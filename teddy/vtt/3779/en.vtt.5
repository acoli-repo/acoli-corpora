And like him, her mum didn’t mind
if friends stayed a while.

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:32.440
Because she was like him, 
and he liked her.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.198
He reckoned she would like him

I mean, this girl was wicked,

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.636

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:54.551
She agreed to this unofficial first date.

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:56.711
In the end he was only
ready one minute early,

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.435
But it didn’t matter because
she arrived one minute late.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.879
And from that moment on
there was nonstop chatter,
