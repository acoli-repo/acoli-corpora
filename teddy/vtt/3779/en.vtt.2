00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.288
Now 60 was beautiful.

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:03.316
With perfectly trimmed cuticles,
dressed in something suitable.

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:04.753
Never rude or crude at all.

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:08.036
Unimprovable, right on time as usual,
more on cue than a snooker ball

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.183
but liked to play it super cool.

00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:13.490
59 wanted to tell her
that he knew her favorite flower.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.162
He thought of her every second,
every minute, every hour.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.801
But he knew it wouldn’t work,
he’d never get the girl.

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.911
Because although she lived 
across the street

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.451
they came from different worlds.

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.881
While 59 admired 60’s
perfectly round figure,

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:29.597
60 thought 59 was odd.
