00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:31.847
Yes this sun was loved
by some more than others,

00:10:31.847 --> 00:10:34.579
It was a case of Joseph
and his dreamcoat and his brothers

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:37.516
Because standing out from the crowd
had its pros and its cons,

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:40.106
And jealousy created enemies
in those he outshone

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:41.417
Such as the Shadow People.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:43.818
Now the Shadow People
didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:46.585
Because he showed up the dark things
the Shadow People did,

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:49.735
And when he shone he showed
the places where the Shadow People hid,

00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:52.353
So the Shadow People had
an evil plan to get rid of him,

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.707
First up -- they made fun of his sunspots,

00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:57.525
Shooting his dreams from the sky,
their words were gunshots,

00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:00.103
Designed to remind him
he wasn’t very cool
