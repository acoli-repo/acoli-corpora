And if you win a poetry slam,
you can call yourself a slam champion

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:03.412
and pretend you're a wrestler,

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:07.476
and if you lose a poetry slam you can say,
"Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,

00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:09.774

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.113

00:05:16.113 --> 00:05:19.178
and got invited to
the Poetry World Cup in Paris,

00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:20.617
which was unbelievable.

00:05:20.617 --> 00:05:24.133
It was people from all around the world
speaking in their native languages

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.585
to be judged by five French strangers.

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:28.744
(Laughter)

00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:32.715
And somehow, I won, which was great,
