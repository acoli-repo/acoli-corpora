00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:02.718
But that’s when
Little Miss Sunshine came along

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:05.650
Singing her favorite song
about how we’re made to be strong,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.156
And you don’t have to be wrong to belong,
Just be true to who you are,

00:12:09.156 --> 00:12:11.362
because we are all stars at heart.

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:15.193
Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.458
The kind of girl when you looked at her

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:19.174
you forgot stuff,

00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:21.164
But for him, there was no forgetting her,

00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:23.645
The minute he saw her
her image burned in his retina,

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:25.957
She was out of this world,
and she accepted him,

00:12:25.957 --> 00:12:29.220
Something about this girl meant he knew
whenever she was next to him,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.121
Things weren’t as dark as they seemed,
and he dared to dream,
