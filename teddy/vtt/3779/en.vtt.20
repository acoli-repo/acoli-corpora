00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:00.087
Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.553
And it brightened his day
to see his little boy run,

00:10:02.553 --> 00:10:05.219
Not because of what he’d done,
nor the problems overcome,

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:08.134
But that despite that his disposition
remained a sunny one.

00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:10.730
It hadn’t always been like this.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.461
There’d been times when he’d tried
to hide his brightness,

00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.597
You see, every star
hits periods of hardship,

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:18.801
It takes a brighter light
to inspire them through the darkness.

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.155
If we go back to when
he was born in a nebula,

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:23.474
We know that he never
was thought of as regular,

00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:25.210
Because he had a flair about him,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.765
To say the Midas touch is wrong

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.203
But all he went near
seemed to turn a little bronze,

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:31.847
Yes this sun was loved
by some more than others,
