00:06:55.248 --> 00:07:00.402
There’d be a paper princess Kate
but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,

00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.385
and then we’d all live in fear of
killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:06.439
because the paper propaganda
propagates the people's prejudices,

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.095
papers printing pictures of the
photogenic terrorists.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.615
A little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:14.288
And in a pop-up population
people’s problems pop up too.

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:17.295
There’d be a pompous paper parliament
who remained out of touch,

00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:20.282
and who ignored the people's protests
about all the paper cuts,

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:23.524
then the peaceful paper protests
would get blown to paper pieces,

00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:26.064
by the confetti cannons
manned by pre-emptive police.

00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:29.639
And yes there’d still be paper money,
so there’d still be paper greed,

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.358
and the paper piggy bankers
pocketing more than they need,
