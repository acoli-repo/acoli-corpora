00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:02.648
(Applause)

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:10.334
That was the first poem that I wrote

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:14.753
and it was for a prime number-themed 
poetry night -- (Laughter) --

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.973
which turned out to be
a prime number-themed poetry competition.

00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:21.200
And I became a prime number-themed
poetry competition winner,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.709
or as I like to call it,
a prime minister. (Laughter)

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:27.657
And this is how I discovered
these things called poetry slams,

00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:29.791
and if you don't know what 
a poetry slam is,

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.485
it was a format come up with
in America 30 years ago
