00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.485
it was a format come up with
in America 30 years ago

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.457
as a way of tricking people
into going to poetry events

00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:38.312
by putting an exciting word
like "slam" on the end.

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:39.706
(Laughter)

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:42.608
And each performer got
three minutes to perform

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:45.403
and then random audience members
would hold up scorecards,

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.530
and they would end up
with a numerical score,

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.738
and what this meant is,

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:51.943
it kind of broke down the barrier
between performer and audience

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:54.653
and encouraged the kind
of connection with the listener.

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:56.681
And what it also means is you can win.

00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:01.021
And if you win a poetry slam,
you can call yourself a slam champion
