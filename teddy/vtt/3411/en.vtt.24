I don't like him, that means
I don't know him well enough.

00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:02.919

00:12:09.285 --> 00:12:11.826

and reach out and reach across,

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:17.302
miracles can happen.

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:19.157

look to your left, look to your right.

00:12:29.061 --> 00:12:35.011

the unique talents, skills
