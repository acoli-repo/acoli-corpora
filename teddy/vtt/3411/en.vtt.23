Now, I don't think too many organizations
welcome newcomers that way anymore,

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:38.927
but still, many times people arrive
with that message of scarcity anyway.

00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:40.348
It's me or you.

00:11:40.372 --> 00:11:44.948
It's awfully hard to team if you
inadvertently see others as competitors.

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.295
So we have to overcome that one as well,

00:11:47.319 --> 00:11:50.961
and when we do,
the results can be awesome.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.394
Abraham Lincoln said once,

00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:57.003
"I don't like that man very much.
I must get to know him better."

00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:58.978
Think about that --

00:11:59.002 --> 00:12:01.744
I don't like him, that means
I don't know him well enough.
