00:00:00.864 --> 00:00:03.435
It's August 5, 2010.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.281
A massive collapse at the San JosÃ©
Copper Mine in Northern Chile

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:14.486
has left 33 men trapped half a mile --
that's two Empire State Buildings --

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.341
below some of the hardest
rock in the world.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:23.212
They will find their way to a small refuge
designed for this purpose,

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:27.316
where they will find intense heat, filth

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.301
and about enough food
for two men for 10 days.
