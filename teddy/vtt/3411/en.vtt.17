00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:32.956
And they were willing to take risks
to learn fast what might work.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.206
And ultimately, 17 days
into this remarkable story,

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.971
ideas came from everywhere.

00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:43.473
They came from André Sougarret,
who is a brilliant mining engineer

00:08:43.497 --> 00:08:46.205
who was appointed by the government
to lead the rescue.

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:47.871
They came from NASA.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.467
They came from Chilean Special Forces.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.331
They came from volunteers
around the world.

00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:57.646
And while many of us,
including myself, watched from afar,

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:02.342
these folks made slow,
painful progress through the rock.
