I think this is a bigger problem
than most of us realize.

00:07:07.128 --> 00:07:11.732
In fact, I think

the future that we aspire to build.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.061
And so it becomes a problem
that we have to understand,

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:23.017
a problem that we have
to figure out how to crack.

00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:27.088
