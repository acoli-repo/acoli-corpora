00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.904
But there's another barrier,
and you all know it.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.326
You wouldn't be in this room
if you didn't know it.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.785
And to explain it, I'm going to quote
from the movie "The Paper Chase."

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:10.826
This, by the way, is what Hollywood thinks

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.966

is supposed to look like.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.248
You be the judge.

The professor in this famous scene,

00:11:16.306 --> 00:11:19.368
he's welcoming the new 1L class,

00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:21.861
and he says, "Look to your left.
Look to your right.

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:23.607
one of you won't be here next year."

00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:26.522
What message did they hear?
"It's me or you."

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.359
For me to succeed, you must fail.

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:33.892
Now, I don't think too many organizations
welcome newcomers that way anymore,
