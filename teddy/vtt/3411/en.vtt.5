00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:30.025
more and more of us have to work
with different people all the time

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.412
to get our work done.

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:34.070
We don't have the luxury of stable teams.

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:38.224
Now, when you can have that luxury,
by all means do it.

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:40.992
But increasingly for a lot
of the work we do today,

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.474
we don't have that option.

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:45.350
One place where this is true is hospitals.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.935
This is where I've done
a lot of my research over the years.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.801
So it turns out hospitals
have to be open 24/7.

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:57.964
And patients -- well,
they're all different.

00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:00.745
They're all different
in complicated and unique ways.
