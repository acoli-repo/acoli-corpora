00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:02.666
Now, taking care of patients
in the emergency room

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.128
and designing an animated film

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:07.440
are obviously very different work.

00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:11.200
Yet underneath the differences,
they have a lot in common.

00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:14.623
You have to get different expertise

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:18.172
you don't have fixed roles,
you don't have fixed deliverables,

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:21.734
you're going to be doing a lot of things
that have never been done before,

00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:24.220
and you can't do it in a stable team.

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:28.363
Now, this way of working isn't easy,

00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:31.939
but as I said, it's more and more
the way many of us have to work,
