You can think of teaming
as a kind of pickup game in the park,

00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:05.161
in contrast to the formal,
well-practiced team.

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:07.713
Now, which one is going
to win in a playoff?

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:09.333
The answer is obvious.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.692
So why do I study teaming?

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.972
It's because it's the way
more and more of us have to work today.

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:21.295
With 24/7 global fast-paced operations,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.031
crazy shifting schedules

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.771
and ever-narrower expertise,

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:30.025
more and more of us have to work
with different people all the time
