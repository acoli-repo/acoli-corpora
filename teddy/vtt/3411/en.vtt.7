Consider what it takes
to create an animated film,

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:34.460
an award-winning animated film.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:37.640
I had the good fortune
to go to Disney Animation

00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:42.602
and study over 900 scientists, artists,

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.013
storytellers, computer scientists

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:49.000
as they teamed up in constantly
changing configurations

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:52.342
to create amazing outcomes like "Frozen."

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:56.805
They just work together,
and never the same group twice,

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.151
not knowing what's going to happen next.

00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:02.666
Now, taking care of patients
in the emergency room
