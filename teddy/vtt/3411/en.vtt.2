00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:00.605
And it's not even clear who's in charge.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.554
Yet, within 70 days, all 33 of these men
will be brought to the surface alive.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.700
This remarkable story is a case study

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:12.083
in the power of teaming.

00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:14.017
So what's "teaming"?

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.248
Teaming is teamwork on the fly.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:18.724
It's coordinating
and collaborating with people

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:20.713
across boundaries of all kinds --

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:25.421
expertise, distance,
time zone, you name it --

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:27.185
to get work done.

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.784
Think of your favorite sports team,
because this is different.
