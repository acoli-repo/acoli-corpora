It seemed that teaming
across industry boundaries

00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:35.035
was really, really hard.

00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:37.427
OK, so ...

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:41.838
We had inadvertently discovered

00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:45.366
what I call "professional culture clash"
with this project.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.449
You know, software engineers
and real estate developers

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:51.066
think differently --

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.848
really differently:

00:06:52.872 --> 00:06:57.213
different values, different time frames --
time frames is a big one --

00:06:57.237 --> 00:07:00.394
and different jargon, different language.
