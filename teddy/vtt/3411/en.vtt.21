It's hard to offer an idea
that might be a stupid idea

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.016
if you don't know people very well.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.867
You need psychological safety to do that.

00:10:35.613 --> 00:10:40.267
They overcame what I like to call
the basic human challenge:

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:43.337
it's hard to learn if you already know.

00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:46.785
And unfortunately, we're hardwired
to think we know.

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:50.103
And so we've got to remind ourselves --
and we can do it --

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:51.317
to be curious;

00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:53.539
to be curious about what others bring.

00:10:53.563 --> 00:10:59.206
And that curiosity can also spawn
a kind of generosity of interpretation.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.904
But there's another barrier,
and you all know it.
