00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.784
Think of your favorite sports team,
because this is different.

00:01:30.808 --> 00:01:35.793
Sports teams work together: that magic,
those game-saving plays.

00:01:35.817 --> 00:01:39.900
Now, sports teams win
because they practice.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:44.389
But you can only practice
if you have the same members over time.

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:46.529
And so you can think of teaming ...

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.843
Sports teams embody
the definition of a team,

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:51.236
the formal definition.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.261
It's a stable, bounded,
reasonably small group of people

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.967
who are interdependent
in achieving a shared outcome.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.213
You can think of teaming
as a kind of pickup game in the park,
