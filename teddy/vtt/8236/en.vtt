00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:02.206
(In Ilnu-aimun: Hello).

00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:03.374
I’m Valérie Courtois

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:05.835
and I’m from the Ilnu community
of Mashteuiatsh,

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:08.546
located in Pekuakami or Lac Saint-Jean,

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:10.757
the heart of what is now known as Québec.

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:14.385
It is an honor to be here
with you tonight.

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:19.057
A good friend and colleague of mine,
the Honorable Ethel Blondin-Andrew,

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:22.518
the first Indigenous woman
to be elected to Canada's parliament

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:24.562
and to serve in cabinet,

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.773
shared with me some wisdom she received:

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:28.483
“A mark of a good leader

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:30.943
is if they leave a room
filled with more hope
