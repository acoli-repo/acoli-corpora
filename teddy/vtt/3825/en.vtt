Isadora Duncan --

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.527
(Music) --

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:09.650
crazy, long-legged woman
from San Francisco,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.369
got tired of this country,
and she wanted to get out.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.934
Isadora was famous
somewhere around 1908

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:25.299
for putting up a blue curtain,

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:27.504
and she would stand

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:30.753
with her hands over her solar plexus
