They had a difficult time,
but they were positive, they had hope.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.776
The last time, the camp has grown,
maybe four or five thousand people.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.376
It seemed more permanent,
NGOs have arrived,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.216
a small school has opened.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.616
But the thing is that the refugees
have stayed for a longer time,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.536
and the French government has managed
to seal off the borders better,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.616
so now The Jungle is growing,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.856
along with the despair
and hopelessness among the refugees.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.576
