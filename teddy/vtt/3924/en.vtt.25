Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.816
This is Tomm Christiansen,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.602
who took most of the pictures you have
seen and they've done reporting together.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.056
Tomm, you two have been
back to Calais recently.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.696
This was the third trip.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.776
It was after the publication
of the article.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.936
What has changed?
What have you seen there?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.389
Tomm Christiansen:
The first time we were in Calais,

00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:58.056
it was about 1,500 refugees there.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.736
They had a difficult time,
but they were positive, they had hope.
