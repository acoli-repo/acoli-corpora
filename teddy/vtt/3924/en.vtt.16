00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.536
We first heard about Shadi
after a cousin of his, living in Germany,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.016
had read an Arabic translation
of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.374
So we got in touch with him.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.456
Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.856
was also raised in Damascus.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.416
He was a working kind of guy.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.856
He ran a tire repair shop
and later worked in a printing company.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.776
He lived with his extended family,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.736
but their house got bombed
early in the war.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.680
So the family fled to an area
of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.
