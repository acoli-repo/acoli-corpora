00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.296
go to university,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.736
or just find work to be able to provide
for yourself and the ones you love.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.376
A better life would be
a future of some possibilities

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.696
compared to nearly none,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.480
and that's a strong motivation.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.576
And I have no trouble imagining

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.096
that after spending weeks or even months

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.016
as a second-grade citizen,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.176
living on the streets
or in a horrible makeshift camp

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.656
with a stupid, racist name
like "The Jungle,"

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.200
most of us would be willing
to do just about anything.
