00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.735
So this right here

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.816
is the tiny village of Elle,
close to Lista.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.200
It's right at the southernmost
tip of Norway.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.736
And on January 2 this year,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.976
an elderly guy who lives in the village,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.896
he went out to see what was cast ashore

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.520
during a recent storm.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.296
And on a patch of grass
right next to the water's edge,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320
he found a wetsuit.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.320
It was grey and black,
and he thought it looked cheap.
