00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.320
It was grey and black,
and he thought it looked cheap.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.296
Out of each leg of the wetsuit

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
there were sticking two white bones.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.320
It was clearly the remains
of a human being.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.296
And usually, in Norway,
dead people are identified quickly.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.856
So the police started searching

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.976
through missing reports
from the local area,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.216
national missing reports,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.696
and looked for accidents
with a possible connection.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.920
They found nothing.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.416
So they ran a DNA profile,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.576
and they started searching
internationally through Interpol.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
Nothing.
