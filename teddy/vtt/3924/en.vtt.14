00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.416
where his uncle lives.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.576
He makes it into Algeria,
walks into Libya,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.416
pays a people smuggler to help him
with the crossing into Italy by boat,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.336
and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.040
the city right next to Calais
by the English Channel.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:17.336
We know he made at least 12 failed
attempts to cross the English Channel

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.960
by hiding in a truck.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.200
But at some point,
he must have given up all hope.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.416
The last night we know he was alive,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.960
he spent at a cheap hotel
close to the train station in Dunkirk.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.997
We found his name in the records,
and he seems to have stayed there alone.
