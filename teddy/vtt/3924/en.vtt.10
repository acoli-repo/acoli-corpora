00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.776
and the numbers don't say anything
about who these people are,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.280
where they came from, or why they're here.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.879
And first, I want to tell you
about one of them.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.096
This is 22-year-old
Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.016
We first heard about him
after being in Calais the first time

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.816
looking for answers to the theory
of the two dead bodies.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.976
And after a while, we heard this story

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.296
about a Syrian man
who was living in Bradford in England,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.096
and had been desperately searching
for his nephew Mouaz for months.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.096
And it turned out the last time
anybody had heard anything from Mouaz
