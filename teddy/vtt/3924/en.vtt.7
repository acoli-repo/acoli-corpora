00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.120
to swim across the English Channel
in order to reach England.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.496
It is a story about the fact
that everybody has a name,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.960
everybody has a story,
everybody is someone.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.096
But it is also a story about what
it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.056

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.296
under horrible conditions.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.296
It has been dubbed

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.376
Limited access to food,
limited access to water,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.896
limited access to health care.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.200
Disease and infections are widespread.
