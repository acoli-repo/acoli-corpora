Disease and infections are widespread.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.096
And they're all stuck here
because they're trying to get to England

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.536
in order to claim asylum.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.096
And they do that by hiding in the back
of trucks headed for the ferry,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.320
or the Eurotunnel,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.776
or they sneak inside
the tunnel terminal at night

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.680
to try to hide on the trains.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.456
Most want to go to Britain
because they know the language,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.976
and so they figure it would be easier
to restart their lives from there.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.816
They want to work, they want to study,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.976
they want to be able
to continue their lives.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.936
A lot of these people are
highly educated and skilled workers.
