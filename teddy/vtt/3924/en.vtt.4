00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.319
and it triggered me and my colleague,
photographer Tomm Christiansen,

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:03.416
and we of course had the obvious question:
who were these people?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
At the time, I'd barely

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.256
Calais is basically known for two things.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.096
It's the spot in continental Europe
closest to Britain,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.656

and are trying desperately
to cross over to Britain.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.856

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.256
and the police made this theory as well.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.471
Because if you or I or anybody else
