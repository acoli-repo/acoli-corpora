Well, if you disappear one day,
nobody will notice.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.886
The police won't come search for you
because nobody knows you're gone.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.896
And this is what happened
to Shadi Omar Kataf

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240
and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:15.816
Me and Tomm went to Calais
for the first time in April this year,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.176
and after three months of investigation,
we were able to tell the story

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.976
about how these two young men
fled the war in Syria,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.736
ended up stuck in Calais,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.136
bought wetsuits and drowned
in what seems to have been an attempt

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.120
to swim across the English Channel
in order to reach England.
