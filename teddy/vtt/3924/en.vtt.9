00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.936
A lot of these people are
highly educated and skilled workers.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.496
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,
you'll meet lawyers, politicians,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.176
engineers, graphic designers,
farmers, soldiers.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.629
You've got the whole spectrum.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.896
But who all of these people are

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.376
usually gets lost in the way
we talk about refugees and migrants,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.416
because we usually do that in statistics.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.616
So you have 60 million refugees globally.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.656
About half a million
have made the crossing

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.136
over the Mediterranean
into Europe so far this year,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.416
and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.936
But these are numbers,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.776
and the numbers don't say anything
about who these people are,
