00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.471
Because if you or I or anybody else
with a firm connection to Europe

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:34.696
goes missing off the coast of France,
people would just know.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.976
Your friends or family
would report you missing,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.776
the police would come search for you,
the media would know,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.056
and there would be
pictures of you on lampposts.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.128
It's difficult to disappear
without a trace.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.976
But if you just fled the war in Syria,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
and your family,
if you have any family left,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.056
don't necessarily know where you are,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.096
and you're staying here illegally

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.960
amongst thousands of others
who come and go every day.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.120
Well, if you disappear one day,
nobody will notice.
