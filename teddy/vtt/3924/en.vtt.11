00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.096
And it turned out the last time
anybody had heard anything from Mouaz

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.776
was October 7, 2014.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.360
That was the same date
the wetsuits were bought.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.376
So we flew over there and we met the uncle

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.496
and we did DNA samples of him,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.816
and later on got additional DNA samples
from Mouaz's closest relative

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.040
who now lives in Jordan.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.696
The analysis concluded

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.216
the body who was found in a wetsuit
on a beach in the Netherlands

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.160
was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.216
And while we were doing
all this investigation,
