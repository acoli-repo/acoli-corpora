He's still waiting
for his funeral in Norway,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.280
and none of his family
will be able to attend.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.616
Many may think that the story
about Shadi and Mouaz

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.440
is a story about death,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.016
but I don't agree.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.496
To me, this is a story about two questions
that I think we all share:

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.296
what is a better life,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.640
and what am I willing to do to achieve it?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.536
And to me, and probably a lot of you,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.136
a better life would mean

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.056
being able to do more
of what we think of as meaningful,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.080
whether that be spending more time
with your family and friends,
