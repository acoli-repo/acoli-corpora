00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.997
We found his name in the records,
and he seems to have stayed there alone.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.616
The day after, he went into Calais,
entered a sports shop

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.096
a couple of minutes
before 8 o'clock in the evening,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.656
along with Shadi Kataf.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.696
They both bought wetsuits,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.136
and the woman in the shop

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.732
was the last person we know of
to have seen them alive.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.056
We have tried to figure out
where Shadi met Mouaz,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.496
but we weren't able to do that.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.616
But they do have a similar story.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.536
We first heard about Shadi
after a cousin of his, living in Germany,
