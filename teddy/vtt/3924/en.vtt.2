00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
Nothing.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.760
This was a person
that nobody seemed to be missing.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.160
It was an invisible life
heading for a nameless grave.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.736
But then, after a month,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.056
the police in Norway got a message
from the police in the Netherlands.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.696
A couple of months earlier,
they had found a body,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.000
in an identical wetsuit,
and they had no idea who this person was.

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.696
But the police in the Netherlands
managed to trace the wetsuit

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.096
by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.
