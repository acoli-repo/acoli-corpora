00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:02.341
We are losing our listening.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.420
We spend roughly 60 percent
of our communication time listening,

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:08.976
but we're not very good at it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.507
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:13.033
Now -- not you, not this talk,

00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:14.582
but that is generally true.

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:15.756
(Laughter)

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.293
Let's define listening
as making meaning from sound.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.211
It's a mental process,

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.457
and it's a process of extraction.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.046
We use some pretty cool
techniques to do this.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.809
One of them is pattern recognition.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.185
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail
party like this,
