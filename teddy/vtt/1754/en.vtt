00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've tried to break it up into three parts:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and really address the qualities of the human interface.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And these will be some simple design qualities

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and they will also be some qualities of, if you will,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the intelligence of interaction.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
new media falling very much into that mold.
