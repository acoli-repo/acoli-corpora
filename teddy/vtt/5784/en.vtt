00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:02.300
I am a tree hugger.

00:00:02.942 --> 00:00:04.546
I spent much of my childhood

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.376
on the great lower limb
of a massive copper beech,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.219
alternately reading and looking up
at the sky through its branches.

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.346
I felt safe and cared for

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.946
and connected to something
infinitely larger than myself.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.250
I thought the trees were immortal,
that they would always be here.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.966
But I was wrong.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.768
The trees are dying.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.576
Climate change is killing
the cedars of Lebanon

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.885
and the forests of the American West.
