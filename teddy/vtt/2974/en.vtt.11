00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:30.165
I wanted to give that doctor
every piece of evidence

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.292
that I was not the date
of birth in that file.

00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:37.124
And I made sure to mention things like,

00:05:37.148 --> 00:05:38.839
"I just got my bachelor's degree

00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:41.426
and I'm applying
to these doctoral programs,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.381
I'm going to study these things."

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:47.543
And "my long-term partner
has this kind of business,"

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.993
and "I've done research
on this for months.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.325
I understand everything
about it, all the risks."

00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:58.323
Because I needed the doctor to know
that this was not a whim,

00:05:58.347 --> 00:06:00.308
not reactionary,
