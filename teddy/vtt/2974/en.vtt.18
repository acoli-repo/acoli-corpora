(Applause)

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.531
and human beings
are not to be gambled with.

00:09:06.058 --> 00:09:12.085
He then tells me why no one
was going to approve this procedure,

00:09:12.109 --> 00:09:13.624
certainly not he,

00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:16.887
because of a concept
called medical paternalism,

00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:21.976
which allows him,
as my well-informed provider,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.230
to make decisions for me ...

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.294
based on his perception
of my best interest,

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.024
regardless of what I,
as the patient, want or believe.
