00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:05.519
in the way that adults do
at the absurdities of children.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.548
And they would tell me knowingly,

00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:10.127
"You'll change your mind."

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:15.382
And people have been saying
things like that to me my whole life.

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:19.782
Otherwise polite conversation
can turn intrusive fast.

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.088

00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:25.919
(Laughter)

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.292
"Do your parents know?"

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:28.466
(Laughter)

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:30.886
"Don't you want a family?"
