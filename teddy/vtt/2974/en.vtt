00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.833
I recognized the roles
that were placed on me very early.

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.982
One persistent concept that I observed --

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.363
existing in our language, in our media --

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:16.378
was that women are not only
supposed to have children,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.222
they are supposed to want to.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:22.503
This existed everywhere.

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:26.552
It existed in the ways
that adults spoke to me

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:30.536
when they posed questions
in the context of "when."
