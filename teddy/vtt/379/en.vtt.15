00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:30.060
a professionalized pit-emptying service

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.638
so that we can create a small business out of it,

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:34.471
create profits and jobs,

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:35.855
and the hope is that,

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.646
as we are rethinking sanitation,

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:41.024
we are extending the life of these pits

00:07:41.024 --> 00:07:43.172
so that we don't have to resort

00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:44.977
to quick solutions

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:46.941
that don't really make sense.

00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:50.569
I believe that access to adequate sanitation

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.493
is a basic human right.

00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:54.110
We need to stop the practice

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.900
of lower castes and lower-status people

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.442
going down and being condemned to empty pits.
