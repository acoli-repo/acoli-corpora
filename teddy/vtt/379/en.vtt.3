00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:30.272
where it's not available, newspaper

00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:33.792
or rags or corncobs.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:36.290
And this is not just a piece of trivia,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.146
but it's really important to understand

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.339
and solve the sanitation problem.

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:42.623
And it is a big problem:

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.668
There are 2.5 billion people in the world

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:47.829
who don't have access to adequate sanitation.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.932
For them, there's no modern toilet.

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:53.843
And there are 1.1 billion people

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.237
whose toilets are the streets

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:59.163
or river banks or open spaces,

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:01.142
and again, the technical term for that is
