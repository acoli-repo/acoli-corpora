00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.229
which is a high-value fertilizer,

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.727
and then the fecal material can then be disinfected

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:07.416
and again converted to high-value end products.

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:09.621
Or, for example, in some of our research,

00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.264
you can reuse the water by treating it

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:14.402
in on-site sanitation systems

00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:17.163
like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.

00:06:17.163 --> 00:06:19.846
So we can open up all these possibilities

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:23.334
if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:25.000
and treatment plants.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.418
So you might be asking, who's going to pay?

00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:30.376
Well, I'm going to argue that governments
