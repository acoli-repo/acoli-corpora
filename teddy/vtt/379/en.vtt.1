00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.508
on using leading-edge molecular techniques,

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:33.120
DNA- and RNA-based methods

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.559
to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.922
and again to optimize these systems.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.171
And over the years,

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.423
I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:47.415
and I've been known to sneak into toilets

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.218
and take my camera phone

00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:51.566
all over the world.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.790
But along the way, I've learned

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.332
that it's not just the technical side,

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.510
but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.
