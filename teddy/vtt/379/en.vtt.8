00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.275
In some of these areas, there's not enough water,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.648
there's no energy,

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:05.683
it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:07.258
to lay out the sewer lines

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.129
and to build the facilities

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.523
and to operate and maintain these systems,

00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:12.095
and if you don't build it right,

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:13.996
you're going to have flush toilets

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:16.404
that basically go straight into the river,

00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:18.879
just like what's happening in many cities

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.272
in the developing world.

00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:22.321
And is this really the solution?

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:24.211
Because essentially, what you're doing is

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.596
you're using clean water

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:28.661
and you're using it to flush your toilet,

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.147
convey it to a wastewater treatment plant
