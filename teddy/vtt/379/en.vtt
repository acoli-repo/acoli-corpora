00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:02.009
I am an engineering professor,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.125
and for the past 14 years

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.933
I've been teaching crap.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.238
(Laughter)

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.255
Not that I'm a bad teacher,

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:12.373
but I've been studying and teaching

00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:14.260
about human waste

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.891
and how waste is conveyed

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.774
through these wastewater treatment plants,

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:20.349
and how we engineer and design

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.339
these treatment plants so that we can protect

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.421
surface water like rivers.

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:27.071
I've based my scientific career

00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.508
on using leading-edge molecular techniques,
