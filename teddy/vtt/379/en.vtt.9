00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.147
convey it to a wastewater treatment plant

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.891
which then discharges to a river,

00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.647
and that river, again, is a drinking water source.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.942
So we've got to rethink sanitation,

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:42.507
and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:44.408
and I'm going to argue that to do this,

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:46.725
you have to employ systems thinking.

00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:49.695
We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:51.968
We start with a human interface,

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:53.869
and then we have to think about how feces

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:56.253
are collected and stored,

00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:58.975
transported, treated and reused —

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.140
and not just disposal but reuse.
