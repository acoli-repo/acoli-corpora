00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.865
As you can see, there's no protective equipment,

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:33.454
no protective clothing.

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:34.460
There's one worker down there.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.098
I hope you can see him.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:38.954
He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:41.385
And in some countries, like India,

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:43.859
the lower castes are condemned

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.233

and they're further condemned by society.

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.756
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:54.591
and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:57.112
for these two and a half billion?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.417
And the answer is, it's just not possible.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.275
In some of these areas, there's not enough water,
