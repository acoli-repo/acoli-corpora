00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:01.578
Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.

00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:03.073
So at North Carolina State University,

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:06.260
we challenged our students to
come up with a simple solution,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.744
and this is what they came up with:

00:07:07.744 --> 00:07:10.387
a simple, modified screw auger

00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:12.321
that can move the waste up

00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:14.840
from the pit and into a collecting drum,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.336
and now the pit worker

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.441
doesn't have to go down into the pit.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:20.347
We tested it in South Africa, and it works.

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.075
We need to make it more robust,

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.368
and we're going to do more testing

00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:25.934
in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:27.553
And our idea is to make this

00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:30.060
a professionalized pit-emptying service
