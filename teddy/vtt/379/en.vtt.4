00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:01.142
and again, the technical term for that is

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:03.179
open defecation,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.283
but that is really simply

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.342
shitting in the open.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.245
And if you're living in fecal material

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.580
and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.086
It's going to get into your drinking water,

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:16.502
into your food, into your immediate surroundings.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.947
So the United Nations estimates

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:23.059
that every year, there are 
1.5 million child deaths

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.768
because of inadequate sanitation.

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:29.817
That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.427
171 every hour,
