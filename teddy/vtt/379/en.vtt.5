00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.427
171 every hour,

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:35.645
4,100 every day.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.737
And so, to avoid open defecation,

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:39.912
municipalities and cities

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:44.104
build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:46.026
in peri-urban and rural areas.

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:49.333
For example, in KwaZulu-Natal 
province in South Africa,

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.667
they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.860
But there's a problem when you scale up

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.110
to tens of thousands, and the problem is,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.912
what happens when the pits are full?

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.497
This is what happens.
