00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.140
and not just disposal but reuse.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.633
So let's start with the human user interface.

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:07.457
I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:09.460
a sitter or a squatter,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.552
the human user interface should be clean

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:14.353
and easy to use, because after all,

00:05:14.353 --> 00:05:16.727
taking a dump should be pleasurable.

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:19.348
(Laughter)

00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:22.205
And when we open the possibilities

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:24.916
to understanding this sanitation chain,

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:26.986
then the back-end technology,

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:30.676
the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,
