We're still not reconstructing them well enough.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
In the U.K. we have an epidemic

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of facial injuries among young people.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We still can't get rid of scars.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We need to do research.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And the best news of all

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
is that surgeons know

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that we need to do research.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And we've set up charities

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that will help us fund

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
the clinical research

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to determine the best treatment practice now

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and better treatment into the future,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Let's leave it as it is."

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you very much indeed.
