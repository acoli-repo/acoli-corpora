00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and the future is tissue engineering.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Just imagine,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I can make a biologically-degradable template.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I can put it in place where it's meant to be.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I can sprinkle a few cells,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
stem cells from the patient's own hip,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
a little bit of genetically engineered protein,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But we've still got problems.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We've got mouth cancer to solve.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We're still not reconstructing them well enough.
