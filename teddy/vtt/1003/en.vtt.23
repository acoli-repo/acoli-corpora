The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If you spend five minutes with somebody,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you start looking beyond their facial appearance,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and the people who you're initially attracted to

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
may seem boring and you lose interest in them,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and the people who you didn't immediately seek out,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
because you didn't find them particularly attractive,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
become attractive people

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because of their personality.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So we've talked a lot about facial appearance.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I now want to share

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
a little bit of the surgery that we do --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
where we're at and where we're going.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
