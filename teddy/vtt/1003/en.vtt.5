Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In other words, he looks entirely normal.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Age is another thing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
when our attitude toward our appearance changes.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by the behavior of adults around them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and she's having difficulty seeing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
As you can see, it's blocking her vision.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
She's also in danger, when she damages this,
