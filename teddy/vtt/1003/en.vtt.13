00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
his upper jaw, his eye-socket.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
He looks pretty good at this stage.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as the disease ravaged his face

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I learned a huge amount from Henry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Henry taught me

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that you can carry on working.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
He enjoyed life to the full,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and a caring family

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and was able to participate socially.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He maintained a calm insouciance.
