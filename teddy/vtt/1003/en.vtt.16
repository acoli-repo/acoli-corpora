00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
he had a successful, fulfilling job.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So we've seen that we can change people's faces.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But when we change people's faces,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
are we changing their identity --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
for better or for worse?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
For instance,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
there are two different types of facial surgery.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We can categorize it like that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
like Sue.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
When they have facial surgery,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they feel their lives have changed

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
because other people perceive them

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as better people.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They don't feel different.
