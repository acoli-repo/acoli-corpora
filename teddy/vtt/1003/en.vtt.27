00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So it's very valuable

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to have that tool in our armamentarium.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But the patients are going to have to take drugs

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
What does that mean?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is not a life-saving transplant --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it is a quality-of-life transplant,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and as a result,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.
