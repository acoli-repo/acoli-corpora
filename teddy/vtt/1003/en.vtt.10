People were making misjudgments all the time

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
on her mood.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So she chose to have facial surgery.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000

she said, "My face now reflects my personality.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
People know now that I'm enthusiastic,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that I'm a happy person."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
or is it a figment of the imagination

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
of the patient themselves?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes
