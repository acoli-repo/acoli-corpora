00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we're going through a dramatic

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and often disproportionate change

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in our facial appearance.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're trying to struggle to find our identity.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We crave the approval of our peers.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So our facial appearance is vital to us

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
as we're trying to project ourselves to the world.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Just remember that single acne spot

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that crippled you for several days.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
trying to raise one eyebrow?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It's a crippling time.
