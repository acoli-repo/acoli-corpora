00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as others see us.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a shocking truth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that we only see mirror images of ourselves,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and we only see ourselves

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in freeze-frame photographic images

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Dysmorphophobia

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is a perversion of this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
where people who may be very good looking

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
regard themselves as hideously ugly

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and are constantly seeking surgery

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to correct their facial appearance.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They don't need this. They need psychiatric help.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph
