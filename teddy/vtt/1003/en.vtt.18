00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
She was just trying to achieve the face

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that matched her personality.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But then we have other people

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
who don't choose to have facial surgery.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They're people who have their face shot off.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They have it forced upon them.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And again, as I told you,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
if they have a caring family

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and good work life,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Their identity doesn't change.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Is this business

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about appearance and preoccupation with it

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a Western phenomenon?
