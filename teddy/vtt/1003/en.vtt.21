We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and actually he's not the good guy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And beauty doesn't equate to goodness,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So we've talked about the static face

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and judging the static face,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
but actually, we're more comfortable

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
with judging the moving face.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We think we can judge people on their expressions.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
like to see a live witness

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --
