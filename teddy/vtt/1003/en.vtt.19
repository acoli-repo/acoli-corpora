00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about appearance and preoccupation with it

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a Western phenomenon?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Muzetta's family give the lie to this.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
which has already made her blind

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
After she had surgery to remove the tumor,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
a pink ribbon in her hair,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and the mother wore a full burqa.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.
