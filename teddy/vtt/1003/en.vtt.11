00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
more violent, etc. -- before the surgery.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
After the surgery,
