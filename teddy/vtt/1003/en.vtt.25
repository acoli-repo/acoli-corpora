00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is the bar that he set for us.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So with modern technology,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
we used computers to make models.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We then bent a plate up to it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We put it in place

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
so we knew it was an accurate position.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We then put bone and tissue from the back.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Here you can see the plate holding it,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and you can see the implants being put in --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
so that in one operation

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
we achieve this

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and this.
