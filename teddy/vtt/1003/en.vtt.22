00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the blink, the hesitation.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And so they want to see live witnesses.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
we can make a judgment on somebody's face.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
our financial adviser's face was covered?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We'd be pretty uncomfortable.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But are we good at making the judgments

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
on facial appearance and movement?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.
