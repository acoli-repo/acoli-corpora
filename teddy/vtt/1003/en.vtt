00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our face is hugely important

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because it's the external, visual part

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that everybody else sees.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's not forget it's a functional entity.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have strong skull bones

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's where our senses are located, our special senses --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
our vision, our speech,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
our hearing, our smell, our taste.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And this bone

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with cavities, the sinuses,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which warm and moisten the air we breathe.
