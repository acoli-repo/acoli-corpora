00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Where do we like to kiss people?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's the face where we're attracted to with that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But let's not forget the hair.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're looking at the image on your left-hand side --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that's my son with his eyebrows present.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There's a definite difference.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
he'd look even odder still.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Dysmorphophobia

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is an extreme version

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the fact that we don't see ourselves

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as others see us.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a shocking truth
