00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that define our face's structure

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are the muscles that deliver our facial expression,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
our universal language of expression,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
our social-signaling system.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And overlying this is the skin drape,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is a hugely complex

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
three-dimensional structure --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
taking right-angled bends here and there,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
having thin areas like the eyelids,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
thick areas like the cheek, different colors.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then we have the sensual factor of the face.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Where do we like to kiss people?
