00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.884
If someone asked you
who the richest people in history were,

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.452
who would you name?

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:13.828
Perhaps a billionaire banker
or corporate mogul,

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.727
like Bill Gates or John D. Rockefeller.

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:20.640
How about African King Musa Keita I?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.105
Ruling the Mali Empire 
in the 14th century CE,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.719
Mansa Musa, or the King of Kings,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.409
amassed a fortune that possibly made him

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.099
one of the wealthiest 
people who ever lived.
