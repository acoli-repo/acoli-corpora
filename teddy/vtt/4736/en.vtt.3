he brought a caravan stretching
as far as the eye could see.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.952
Accounts of this journey are mostly
based on an oral testimony

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:36.647
and differing written records,

00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:40.223
so it's difficult to determine
the exact details.

00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:44.750
But what most agree on is the extravagant
scale of the excursion.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.664
Chroniclers describe an entourage 
of tens of thousands of soldiers,

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:49.884
civilians,

00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:51.074
and slaves,

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:55.114
500 heralds bearing gold staffs
and dressed in fine silks,

00:01:55.114 --> 00:02:00.039
and many camels and horses
bearing an abundance of gold bars.
