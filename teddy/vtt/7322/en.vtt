00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.356
For the past two decades,

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:05.196
I've been professionally managing assets

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:07.796
for large financial institutions.

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.836
But you know, this wasn't my plan
when I first entered the workforce.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:16.276
I was a 20-year-old dreamer
who wanted to change the world.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:20.596
And so at first I entered a nonprofit.

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.036
And this was where I started
asking myself questions

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:28.796
about how we attribute value
to things as a society,

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:32.156
and how capital affects
our shared reality.
