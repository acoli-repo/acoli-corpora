attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:07.384
The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy.

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:09.814
Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply,

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:13.336
it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.194
via the umbilical cord,

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.484
and also exports its waste.

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:22.945
Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:28.416
Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:31.675
The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth,
