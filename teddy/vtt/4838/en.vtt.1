00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:31.173
body hair or fur,

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:33.593
the ability to breathe using lungs,

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:36.524
and nourishing their young with milk.

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:38.264
But despite these similarities,

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.552
these creatures also have 
many biological differences,

00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:44.823
and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth.

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:48.844
Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:50.143
This group includes humans,

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:50.864
cats,

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:51.584
dogs,

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.392
giraffes,

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.354
and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:59.433
Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue,

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.984
attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo.
