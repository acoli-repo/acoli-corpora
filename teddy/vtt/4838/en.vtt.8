Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.507
like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet,

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:07.364
bill,

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:10.174
and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet,

00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:13.103
they are, in fact, mammals.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:16.794
That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:20.504
and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class.

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:21.575
Whether placental,

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:22.544
marsupial,

00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:23.695
or monotreme,

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:27.380
each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.007
have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity
