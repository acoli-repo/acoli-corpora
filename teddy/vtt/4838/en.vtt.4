Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:07.543
that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch.

00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:11.368
Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials,

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.468
which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth,

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:18.207
the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.249
The kangaroo, another marsupial,

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:24.497
gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:27.969
The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas,

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.979
then must climb up to the pouch,

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.799
where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling.
