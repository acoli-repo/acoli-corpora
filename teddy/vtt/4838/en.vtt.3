00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:31.675
The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth,

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.316
when the umbilical cord breaks

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:35.305
and the newborn's own respiratory,

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:36.606
circulatory,

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.296
and waste disposal systems take over.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:45.199
Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim.

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.867
It will spend the next six months

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:53.477
drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.

00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:57.097
Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal -

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.789
marsupials.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.968
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born
