one for her newborn,

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:03.691
and one for her older joey.

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:06.840
The word mammalia means of the breast,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.211
which is a bit of a misnomer

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:11.611
because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches,

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:14.351
they don't actually have breasts.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:21.391
Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth.

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.301
There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species,

00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:26.892
but there are only five left:

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:31.571
four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus.
