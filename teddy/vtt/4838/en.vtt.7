00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:31.571
four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus.

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.412
The name monotreme means one hole

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:37.182
referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction,

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:38.242
excretion,

00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:40.152
and egg-laying.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:40.952
Like birds,

00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:41.812
reptiles,

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:42.663
fish,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.613
dinosaurs,

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:44.613
and others,

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:49.053
these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:51.492
Their eggs are soft-shelled,

00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:56.005
and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.694
until they're large enough 
to feed themselves.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:03.994
Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals,
