00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:09.589
What is the smartest age?

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.760
Perhaps a day of friendly competition
will lead us to the answer.

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.764
Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash—

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:21.559
ten teams of two competing in a decathlon
of mental challenges,

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.020
trivia competitions, and puzzles.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.396
I’ve been training all year.

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.733
I’ll need to pick the smartest,
most capable teammate.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.693
I’ve narrowed down the roster.
