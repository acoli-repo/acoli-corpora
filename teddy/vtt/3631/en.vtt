Every parent's worst nightmare:

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.613
July 20, 2012,

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.494
my phone rings at 4:30 in the morning.

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.111
It's my son Alex's girlfriend, Amanda,

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:16.621
saying hysterically,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.550
"Tom, Tom, there's been a shooting,

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:23.809
and they dragged me out of the theater.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.241
They wouldn't let me stay.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.787
I wanted to [stay],
but they dragged me out."
