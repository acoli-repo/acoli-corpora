00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:32.249
I say to Amanda,

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:34.611
"Amanda, are you OK? Have you been hurt?"

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:39.086
And she said no, that she was fine,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.307
that Alex had saved her life.

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:43.936
I then say,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.017
"Amanda, where's Alex?"

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.029
And she says, sobbing,

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:52.688

They dragged me out of the theater.

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.659
They made me leave.

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:57.112
He was shot.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:59.944
I tried to wake him up,
but I couldn't wake him up.

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:01.786
He wouldn't get up.
