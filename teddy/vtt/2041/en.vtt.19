00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but also chemical pollution.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Together, these form an integrated whole

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
understanding that the planet

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is a complex self-regulating system.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
In fact, most evidence indicates

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"One for all. All for one."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you undermine the ability of the climate system

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
to stay stable.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
The drama here is, in fact, that

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
it may show that the climate challenge
