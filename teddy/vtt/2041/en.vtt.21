00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
In the '50s, we start branching out.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
In the '60s already, through the green revolution

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and the Haber-Bosch process

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
actually, right after Rio.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And today, we are in a situation where we estimate

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that we've transgressed three boundaries,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the rate of biodiversity loss,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
nitrogen and climate change.
