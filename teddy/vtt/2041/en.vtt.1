00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, we're in a phase

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
where transformative change is necessary,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which opens the window for innovation,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for new ideas and new paradigms.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the global phase of sustainability.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a good friend,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a stakeholder, who's always absent

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a stakeholder who refuses to compromise --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
planet Earth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,
