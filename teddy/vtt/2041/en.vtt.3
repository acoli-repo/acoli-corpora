00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we leave Africa, we colonize Australia

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in another crisis, 60,000 years back,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we leave Asia for Europe

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in another crisis, 40,000 years back,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then we enter

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the remarkably stable Holocene phase,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the only period in the whole history of the planet,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that we know of, that can support human development.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A thousand years into this period,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We go from a couple of million people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to the seven billion people we are today.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,
