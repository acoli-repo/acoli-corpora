00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to have her as a witness

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of a remarkable journey,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which humbly reminds us

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
of the period of grace we've had

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
over the past 10,000 years.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a very important period --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We've had the same, roughly, abilities

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that developed civilizations as we know it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the environmental conditions on the planet.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,
