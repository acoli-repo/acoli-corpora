00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
have been caused by the rich minority,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in the mid-18th century.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The majority of the planet,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
aspiring for development, having the right for development,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a momentous pressure.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is that it would be enough

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to avoid average temperatures

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
exceeding two degrees,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
