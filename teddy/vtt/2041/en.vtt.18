00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the systems that, under the hood,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
freshwater use,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
functions which regulate

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
air pollution,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,
