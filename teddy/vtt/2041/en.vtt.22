00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
nitrogen and climate change.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
but we are approaching fast

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But this gives a new paradigm

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to guide humanity,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to put the light on our, so far

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
overpowered industrial vehicle,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
which operates as if

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we're only on a dark, straight highway.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Now the question then is:

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
how gloomy is this?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Is then sustainable development utopia?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Well, there's no science to suggest.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
In fact, there is ample science
