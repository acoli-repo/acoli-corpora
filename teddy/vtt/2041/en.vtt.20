00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
The drama here is, in fact, that

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
it may show that the climate challenge

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
is the easy one,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
if you consider the whole challenge

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
of sustainable development.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the quantified boundaries,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
as suggested by this analysis.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the pre-industrial point,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
where we're very safely in the safe operating space.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
In the '50s, we start branching out.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
In the '60s already, through the green revolution
