00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
over the past 200 years.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
10 years after the Second World War,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
starts in the mid-50s.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I can tell you,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you find something remarkably important,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the conclusion that we may have come to the point

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where we have to bend the curves,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in the history humanity on the planet,
