00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
at a planetary level.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Now, as a scientist,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
what's the evidence for this?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, the evidence is,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
unfortunately, ample.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's not only carbon dioxide

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can take virtually any parameter

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that matters for human well-being --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
nitrous oxide, methane,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
deforestation, overfishing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
land degredation, loss of species --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
they all show the same pattern

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
over the past 200 years.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,
