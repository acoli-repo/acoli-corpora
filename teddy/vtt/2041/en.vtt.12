00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
under multiple pressures of overfishing,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
unsustainable tourism, climate change.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
A trigger and the system tips over,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
loses its resilience,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
soft corals take over,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and we get undesired systems

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that cannot support economic and social development.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The Arctic -- a beautiful system --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a regulating biome at the planetary level,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
taking the knock after knock on climate change,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
appearing to be in a good state.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
No scientist could predict that in 2007,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of its summer ice cover.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And the drama is, of course, that
