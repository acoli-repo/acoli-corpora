00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We live on a human-dominated planet,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
putting unprecedented pressure

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on the systems on Earth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's also part of the good news.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're the first generation -- thanks to science --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to be informed that we may be

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
undermining the stability and the ability

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of planet Earth

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to support human development as we know it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
are so large,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that business as usual is not an option.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, we're in a phase
