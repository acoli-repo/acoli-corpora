00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that wetlands, forests,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
behave in this nonlinear way.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
30 or so scientists around the world

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
gathered and asked a question for the first time,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So we have to ask ourselves:

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
where we're coming too close

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to thresholds that could lead

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to deleterious and very undesired,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
if now catastrophic, change

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
for human development?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You know, you don't want to stand there.
