00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and the ability to rise after a crisis,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This is a new paradigm.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But is it happening anywhere?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Do we have any examples of success

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
on this mind shift being applied at the local level?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Well, yes, in fact we do

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the list can start becoming longer and longer.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
There's good news here,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
for example, from Latin America,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
where plow-based farming systems

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
of the '50s and '60s

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
led farming basically to a dead-end,
