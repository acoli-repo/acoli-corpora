00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The forth pressure is surprise,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the notion and the evidence

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that we need to abandon our old paradigm,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and that in fact, surprise is universal,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and often irreversibly.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of momentous scale.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the Anthropocene,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
where humans are the predominant driver of change

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
at a planetary level.
