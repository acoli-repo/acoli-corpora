Elinor Ostrom,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the latest Nobel laureate of economics,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
clearly shows empirically across the world

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that we can govern the commons

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
if we invest in trust,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
local, action-based partnerships

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and cross-scale institutional innovations,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
where local actors,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
together, can deal with the global commons

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
at a large scale.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.
