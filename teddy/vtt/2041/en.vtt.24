00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
looking at efficiencies and optimization

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
towards a much more flexible,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a much more adaptive approach,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
where we recognize that redundancy,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
both in social and environmental systems,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
is key to be able to deal

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
with a turbulent era of global change.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We have to invest in persistence,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in the ability of social systems and ecological systems

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We have to invest in transformations capability,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
moving from crisis into innovation

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and the ability to rise after a crisis,
