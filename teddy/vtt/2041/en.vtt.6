00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
holding six meters -- level rising,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, you would have wished the climate pressure

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but unfortunately, the third pressure

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is the ecosystem decline.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
such a sharp decline

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in our forests, land and biodiversity.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The forth pressure is surprise,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the notion and the evidence
