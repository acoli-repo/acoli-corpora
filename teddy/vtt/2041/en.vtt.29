00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
into a key component

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of sustainable urban planning.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So crisis leading into opportunities.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Now, what about the future?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
which is feeding a world of nine billion people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We need nothing less than a new green revolution,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and the planet boundaries shows

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It has to basically do this on current land.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We cannot expand anymore,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
because it erodes the planetary boundaries.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.
