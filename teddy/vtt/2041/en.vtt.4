00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we domesticate animals and plants.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The only phase, as we know it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that can support humanity.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
has population growth of course.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, this is not only about numbers;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
have been caused by the rich minority,
