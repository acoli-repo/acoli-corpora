00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
for human development?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You know, you don't want to stand there.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where this gentleman is standing,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
In fact, there's a fence

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
quite upstream of this threshold,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
beyond which you are in a danger zone.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And this is the new paradigm,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which we gathered two, three years back,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
recognizing that our old paradigm

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of just analyzing and pushing and predicting

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
parameters into the future,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Now we to ask ourselves:

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
which are the large environmental processes
