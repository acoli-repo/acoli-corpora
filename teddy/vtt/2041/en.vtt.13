00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of its summer ice cover.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And the drama is, of course, that

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
when the system does this, the logic may change.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It may get locked in an undesired state,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because it changes color, absorbs more energy,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the system may get stuck.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that we are in a precarious situation.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
was a submarine from an unnamed country

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to be able to control the oil resources.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that wetlands, forests,
