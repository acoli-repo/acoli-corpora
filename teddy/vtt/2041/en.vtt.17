00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
led to the final proposition

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that we can only find

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
nine planetary boundaries

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
with which, under active stewardship,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
These include, of course, climate.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
with the three big systems, climate change,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
being the three big systems,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.
