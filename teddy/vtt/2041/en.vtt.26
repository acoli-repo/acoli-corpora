00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
of the '50s and '60s

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
led farming basically to a dead-end,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
among farmers in partnership with scientists

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
combined with mulch farming

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
with locally adapted technologies,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
which today, for example, in some countries,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
have led to a tremendous increase

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in area under mulch, zero till farming

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
which, not only produces more food,
