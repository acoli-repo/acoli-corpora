00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And what shall we do?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
but for example, one policy measure,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
feed-in tariffs on the energy system,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
which is already applied,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
from China doing it on offshore wind systems,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
all the way to the U.S.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but you can subsidize electricity to poor people.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You get people out of poverty.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
while at the same time, stimulating innovation --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
examples of things that can be out scaled quickly

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
at the planetary level.
