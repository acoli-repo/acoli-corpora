I'm a designer and an educator.

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:06.277
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:12.388
to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:17.353
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:23.058
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.973
A couple of examples.

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:27.401
Look at that.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:31.014
This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)
