(Applause)

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.014
Thank you very much.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.976
I have a few pictures,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.626
and I'll talk a little bit
about how I'm able to do what I do.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.507
All these houses are built

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:20.380
from between 70 and 80 percent
recycled material,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.555
stuff that was headed to the mulcher,
the landfill, the burn pile.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.976
It was all just gone.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.976
This is the first house I built.

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.703
This double front door here
with the three-light transom,
