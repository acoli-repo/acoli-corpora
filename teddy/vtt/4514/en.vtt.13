If I can repeat anything,
I have the possibility of a pattern,

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:34.540
from hickory nuts and chicken eggs,
shards of glass, branches.

00:06:34.564 --> 00:06:36.078
It doesn't make any difference.

00:06:36.102 --> 00:06:38.630
That causes a lot of waste
in the building industry.

00:06:38.654 --> 00:06:39.805
The second cause is,

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:57.474
and perfect.

00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:01.693
On the other end of the spectrum,
we have a Dionysian perspective,
