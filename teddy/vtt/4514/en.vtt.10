00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:02.239
What it means is,
for every perception we have,

00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:04.853
it needs to tally
with the one like it before,

00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:08.271
or we don't have continuity,
and we become a little bit disoriented.

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:10.976
So I can show you an object
you've never seen before.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.901
Oh, that's a cell phone.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:15.985
But you've never seen this one before.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.167
What you're doing

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.191
is sizing up the pattern
of structural features,

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.779
and then you go through your databanks:

00:05:22.803 --> 00:05:24.625
Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.641
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:29.155
"Wait a second.

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.334
