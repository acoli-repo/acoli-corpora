00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.126
"This is the famous Budweiser beer,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.208
we know of no other beer,
blah, blah, blah."

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:03.525
So we changed that and put,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.048
"This is the famous Budweiser house.
We don't know of any other house ..."

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:08.224
and so forth and so on.

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.405
This is a deadbolt.

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.171
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper,
which is a very angry woodworking machine.

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.171
And they gave me the fence,
but they didn't give me the shaper,

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.866
so we made a deadbolt out of it.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.131
That'll keep bull elephants
out, I promise.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:21.160
(Laughter)

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:24.038
And sure enough, we've had
no problems with bull elephants.

00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:25.224
(Laughter)

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:28.161
The shower is intended
to simulate a glass of beer.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:31.656
We've got bubbles going up there,
then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.
