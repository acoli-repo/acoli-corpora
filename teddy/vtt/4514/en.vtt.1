00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.703
This double front door here
with the three-light transom,

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.867
that was headed to the landfill.

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:34.723
Have a little turret there.

00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:37.804
And then these buttons
on the corbels here --

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.981
right there --

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.361
those are hickory nuts.

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.492
And these buttons there --

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:44.843
those are chicken eggs.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:46.036
(Laughter)

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.821
Of course, first you have breakfast,

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.760
and then you fill the shell full
of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.228
and you have an architectural button
in just a fraction of the time.

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:58.163
This is a look at the inside.

00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:01.452
You can see the three-light transom
there with the eyebrow windows.
