00:01:58.448 --> 00:02:00.497
(Laughter)

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.204
This is a bathtub I made,

00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:04.285
made out of scrap two-by-four.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:08.543
Started with the rim, and then glued
and nailed it up into a flat,

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.261
corbeled it up and flipped it over,

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.262
then did the two profiles on this side.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.646
It's a two-person tub.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.118
After all, it's not just
a question of hygiene,

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:19.634
but there's a possibility
of recreation as well.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.427
(Laughter)

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:28.318
Then, this faucet here
is just a piece of Osage orange.

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:29.914
It looks a little phallic,

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:31.639
but after all, it's a bathroom.
