00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.334
(Laughter)

00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:31.707
"That's not a cell phone.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.631
That's one of those new
chocolate cell phones."

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.369
(Laughter)

00:05:36.393 --> 00:05:38.080
You'd have to start a new category,

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.166
right between cell phones and chocolate.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.001
(Laughter)

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.691
That's how we process information.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:45.847
You translate that
to the building industry.

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.901
If we have a wall of windowpanes
and one pane is cracked, we go,

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:50.950
"Oh, dear. That's cracked.
Let's repair it.

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:53.610
Let's take it out and throw it away
so nobody can use it

00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:54.794
and put a new one in."

00:05:54.818 --> 00:05:57.040
Because that's what you do
with a cracked pane.

00:05:57.064 --> 00:05:59.524
Never mind that it doesn't
affect our lives at all.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:03.951
It only rattles that expected pattern
and unity of structural features.
