00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:01.693
On the other end of the spectrum,
we have a Dionysian perspective,

00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:04.100
which is more given
to the passions and intuition,

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.903
tolerant of organic texture
and human gesture.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:12.246
So the way the Apollonian personality
takes a picture or hangs a picture is,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.146
they'll get out a transit

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.822
and a laser level

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.016
and a micrometer.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.820
"OK, honey. A thousandth
of an inch to the left.

00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:22.227
That's where we want
the picture. Right. Perfect!"

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.546
Predicated on plumb level,
square and centered.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:28.025
The Dionysian personality
takes the picture and goes:

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.847
(Laughter)
