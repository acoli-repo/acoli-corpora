We've got bubbles going up there,
then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.369
Where do you get lumpy tiles?
Well, of course, you don't.

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:38.094
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you
just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.976
and then you have lumpy tiles.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.523
And then the faucet is a beer tap.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:46.273
(Laughter)

00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:50.699
Then, this panel of glass
is the same panel of glass

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:53.570
that occurs in every middle-class
front door in America.

00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:56.102
We're getting tired of it.
It's kind of clichéd now.

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:59.551
If you put it in the front door,
your design fails.

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.301
So don't put it in the front door;
put it somewhere else.
