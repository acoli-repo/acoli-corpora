The Industrial Revolution
started in the Renaissance

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:02.380
with the rise of humanism,

00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:05.369
then got a little jump start
along about the French Revolution.

00:08:05.393 --> 00:08:08.021
By the middle of the 19th century,
it's in full flower.

00:08:08.045 --> 00:08:10.652
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:13.921
and contraptions that will do anything

00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:15.785
that we, up to that point,

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.560
had to do by hand.

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.659
So now we have standardized materials.

00:08:19.683 --> 00:08:22.541
Well, trees don't grow
two inches by four inches,

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.247
eight, ten and twelve feet tall.

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.296
(Laughter)

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.743
We create mountains of waste.

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:30.308
And they're doing a pretty good job
there in the forest,
