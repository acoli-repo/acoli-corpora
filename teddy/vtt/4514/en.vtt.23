00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.951
Then when they degrade,
what do you do with them?

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.063
Now, all that --

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.374
that Apollonian, Platonic model --

00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:39.961
is what the building industry
is predicated on,

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:42.661
and there are a number of things
that exacerbate that.

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.203
One is that all the professionals,

00:11:45.227 --> 00:11:46.894
all the tradesmen, vendors,

00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:49.296
inspectors, engineers, architects

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.966
all think like this.

00:11:51.438 --> 00:11:53.644
And then it works its way
back to the consumer,

00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.112
who demands the same model.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:57.955
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
We can't get out of it.

00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.847
Then here come the marketeers
and the advertisers.
