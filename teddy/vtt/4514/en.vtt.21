00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:32.112
the American dream, which is a house,

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.723
the dream house.

00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:35.526
The problem is we can't afford it.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.526
So we have the American dream look-alike,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.862
which is a mobile home.

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:41.176
Now there's a blight on the planet.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.454
(Laughter)

00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:44.198
It's a chattel mortgage,

00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:46.199
just like furniture, just like a car.

00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:49.355
You write the check,
and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.586
After a year, you can't get insurance
on everything you have in it,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.881
only on 70 percent.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.654
Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.

00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:56.846
Nothing wrong with that,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.716
unless you ask it to do
what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.943
and that's what happens.
