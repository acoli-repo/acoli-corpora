00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:02.488
and I've had some whopping
failures, I promise --

00:16:02.512 --> 00:16:05.526
big, public, humiliating,
embarrassing failures.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.990
Everybody points and laughs,

00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:10.110
and they say, "He tried it a fifth time,
and it still didn't work!

00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:11.514
What a moron!"

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:13.526
Early on, contractors come by and say,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.313
"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:17.495
but you know,
this just isn't going to work.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.850
What don't you do this?
Why don't you do that?"

00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:22.380
And your instinct is to say,

00:16:22.404 --> 00:16:24.071
"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"

00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:25.526
(Laughter)

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.214
But you don't say that,

00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:29.344
because they're the guys you're targeting.
