It only rattles that expected pattern
and unity of structural features.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:06.784
However, if we took a small hammer,

00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:09.374
and we added cracks
to all the other windows --

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:11.399
(Laughter)

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:12.637
then we have a pattern.

00:06:12.661 --> 00:06:15.728
Because Gestalt psychology
emphasizes recognition of pattern

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:17.783
over parts that comprise a pattern.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.586
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.756
So, that serves me every day.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.526
Repetition creates pattern.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.349
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,

00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:28.647
it makes no difference
what these and those are.

00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.593
If I can repeat anything,
I have the possibility of a pattern,
