00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.943
and that's what happens.

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:02.448
It out-gasses formaldehyde --

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:06.613
so much so that there is
a federal law in place

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:11.201
to warn new mobile home buyers
of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:13.271
Are we just being numbingly stupid?

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:15.102
The walls are this thick.

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:18.103
The whole thing has
the structural value of corn.

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:20.010
(Laughter)

00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:22.606
"So ... I thought Palm Harbor
Village was over there."

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.668
"No, no. We had a wind last night.

00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:26.264
It's gone now."

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:29.526
(Laughter)

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.951
Then when they degrade,
what do you do with them?
