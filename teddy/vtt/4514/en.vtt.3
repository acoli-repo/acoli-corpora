00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.459
you see there are bulges
and pokes and sags and so forth.

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.125
Well, if that ruins your life,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.976
well, then, you shouldn't live there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.877
(Laughter)

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.700
This is a laundry chute.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.139
And this right here is a shoe last --

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:43.995
those are those cast-iron things
you see at antique shops.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.308
So I had one of those,

00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:49.078
so I made some low-tech gadgetry,
where you just stomp on the shoe last,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:51.976
and then the door flies open
and you throw your laundry down.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.786
And then if you're smart enough,
it goes on a basket on top of the washer.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.424
If not, it goes into the toilet.

00:01:58.448 --> 00:02:00.497
(Laughter)
