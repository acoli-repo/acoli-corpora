00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:30.526
My oh my, that makes it worse.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.746
And we get sucked
into that faster than anything.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.479
Then, a man named
Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book

00:12:36.503 --> 00:12:37.988
titled "Being and Nothingness."

00:12:38.012 --> 00:12:40.934
It's a pretty quick read.
You can snap through it in maybe --

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.022
(Laughter)

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.198
maybe two years,

00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:44.954
if you read eight hours a day.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.863
In there, he talked
about the divided self.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:50.965
He said human beings act differently
when they know they're alone

00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:53.049
than when they know
somebody else is around.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:55.375
So if I'm eating spaghetti,
and I know I'm alone,

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.867
I can eat like a backhoe.

00:12:56.891 --> 00:13:00.105
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,
napkin on the table,
