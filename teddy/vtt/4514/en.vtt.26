00:12:56.891 --> 00:13:00.105
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,
napkin on the table,

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:03.446
chew with my mouth open,
make little noises,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.447
scratch wherever I want.

00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:07.331
(Laughter)

00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:08.802
But as soon as you walk in,

00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:11.304
I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."

00:13:11.328 --> 00:13:13.181
Napkin in my lap, half-bites,

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:15.438
chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:20.397
Now, what I'm doing
is fulfilling your expectations

00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:22.303
of how I should live my life.

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:25.601
I feel that expectation,

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.041
and so I accommodate it,

00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:30.311
and I'm living my life according
to what you expect me to do.
