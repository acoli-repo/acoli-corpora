00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.847
Then here come the marketeers
and the advertisers.

00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:03.295
"Woo. Woo-hoo."

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:06.526
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.082
All we have to do
is look at what one company did

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:11.097
with carbonated prune juice.

00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:12.526
How disgusting.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.342
(Laughter)

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.674
But you know what they did?

00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:18.774
They hooked a metaphor into it
and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."

00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:21.792
And pretty soon, we're swilling
that stuff by the lake-ful,

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.527
by the billions of gallons.

00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:26.688
It doesn't even have real prunes!
Doesn't even keep you regular.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.472
(Laughter)

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:30.526
My oh my, that makes it worse.
