00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:01.452
You can see the three-light transom
there with the eyebrow windows.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.530
Certainly an architectural antique
headed to the landfill --

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:07.152
even the lockset
is probably worth 200 dollars.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:09.625
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.646
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.976
if you like to cook -- cool stove.

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:16.388
This is going up into the turret.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:19.647
I got that staircase for 20 dollars,

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:21.555
including delivery to my lot.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.064
(Laughter)

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:26.816
Then, looking up in the turret,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.459
you see there are bulges
and pokes and sags and so forth.
