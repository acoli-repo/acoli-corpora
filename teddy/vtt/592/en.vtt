I spent the past three years

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:05.430
talking to some of the worst
people on the internet.

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.637
Now, if you've been online recently,

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:12.465

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.027
I wanted to understand

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:23.438
Ultimately, I wanted to know

it might be having on our society.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:30.066
So in 2016, I started tracing
some of these memes back to their source,
