00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:02.104
but the way we figure out
the causes of infant mortality

00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:05.139
in those countries
with the highest infant mortality

00:10:05.163 --> 00:10:07.159
is a conversation with mom.

00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:12.326
A health worker asks a mom
who has just lost her child,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.019
"Was the baby vomiting?
Did they have a fever?"

00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:17.992
And that conversation may take place

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:21.927
as long as three months
after the baby has died.

00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.099
Now, put yourself
in the shoes of that mom.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:31.195
It's a heartbreaking,
excruciating conversation.
