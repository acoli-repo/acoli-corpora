For me, precision medicine comes
from a very special place.

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.701
I trained as a cancer doctor,
an oncologist.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.697
I got into it because I wanted
to help people feel better.

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:16.296
But too often my treatments
made them feel worse.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:22.013
I still remember young women
being driven to my clinic

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.744
by their moms --

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:29.410
adults, who had to be helped
into my exam room by their mothers.
