00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.416
we find out in certain areas of Africa

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.186
that babies are dying
because of a bacterial infection

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.757
transferred from the mother to the baby,

00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:10.254
known as Group B streptococcus.

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:16.511
In the absence of treatment,
mom has a seven times higher chance

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:18.735
that her next baby will die.

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:24.025
Once we define the problem,
we can prevent that death

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:28.132
with something as cheap
and safe as penicillin.

00:11:29.894 --> 00:11:32.445
We can do that because then we'll know.
