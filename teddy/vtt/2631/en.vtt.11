HER2-positive breast cancer,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.718
at the time, the scariest

And that precision let us
hit hard the cancer cells,

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:48.817
while sparing and being more

00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.157
A huge breakthrough.

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.261
It felt like a miracle,

00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:58.040
