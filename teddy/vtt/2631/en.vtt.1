00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.619
I loved growing up in a big family.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.832
And one of my favorite things
was picking names.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.369
But by the time child
number seven came along,

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:43.710
we had nearly run out of middle names.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.917
It was a long deliberation

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:50.948
before we finally settled
on Jennifer Bridget.

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:55.084
Every parent in this audience

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:57.732
knows the joy and excitement

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.194
of picking a new baby's name.
