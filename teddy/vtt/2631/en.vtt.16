We know that when these women
become pregnant,

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.678
they can transfer the virus to their baby.

00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:08.803
We also know in the absence of therapy,

00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:12.310
half those babies will not survive
until the age of two.

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:18.583
But we know that antiretroviral therapy
can virtually guarantee

00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:21.558
that she will not transmit
the virus to the baby.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.241
So what do we do?

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:28.270
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach,
kind of like that blast of chemo,

00:08:28.294 --> 00:08:31.474
would mean we test and treat
every pregnant woman in the world.
