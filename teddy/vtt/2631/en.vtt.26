00:12:56.876 --> 00:13:00.421
But you know, we all live in two worlds:

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:04.333
the rich world and the poor world.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.610
And what I'm most excited about
about precision public health

00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:12.093
is bridging these two worlds.

00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:16.071
Every day in the rich world,

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:19.350
we're bringing incredible
talent and tools --

00:13:19.374 --> 00:13:21.333
everything at our disposal --

00:13:21.357 --> 00:13:26.270
to precisely target diseases
in ways I never imagined

00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:28.128
would be possible.

00:13:28.152 --> 00:13:33.168
Surely, we can tap into
that kind of talent and tools
