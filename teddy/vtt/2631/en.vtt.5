00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.353
That's the population of Vancouver.

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:34.631
And the shocking thing is:

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:36.341
Why?

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.135
In too many cases, we simply don't know.

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:45.271
Now, I remember recently seeing
an updated pie chart.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.463
And the pie chart was labeled,

00:02:47.487 --> 00:02:50.999
"Causes of death in children
under five worldwide."

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:55.883
And there was a pretty big section
of that pie chart, about 40 percent --

00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:59.269
40 percent was labeled "neonatal."
