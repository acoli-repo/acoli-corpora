00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.261
a time of joy, excitement,
dreaming of the future of that child --

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:03.155
while in another world,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.099
parents are filled with dread,

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:09.698
not daring to dream
of a future for their child

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:11.588
beyond a few precious weeks.

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.185
How can that be?

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.674
How can it be that 2.6 million babies

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:22.492
die around the world

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.936
before they're even one month old?

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.901
2.6 million.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.353
That's the population of Vancouver.
