00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.194
of picking a new baby's name.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:02.835
And I was excited and thrilled

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.562
to help my mom in that special
ceremonial moment.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:09.863
But it's not like that everywhere.

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:13.846
I travel a lot and I see a lot.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.366
But it took me by surprise to learn

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.569
in an area of Ethiopia,

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:23.274
parents delay picking the names
for their new babies

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:24.849
by a month or more.

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:27.325
Why delay?

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:31.645
Why not take advantage
of this special ceremonial time?
