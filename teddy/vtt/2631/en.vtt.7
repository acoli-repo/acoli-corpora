00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:30.995
So our first step in restoring
the dreams of those parents

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.196
is to answer the question:

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.169
Why are babies dying?

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.094
So today, I want to talk
about a new approach,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.055
an approach that I feel

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.763
will not only help us
know why babies are dying,

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.744
but is beginning to completely transform

00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:52.552
the whole field of global health.

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:57.361
It's called "Precision Public Health."

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:03.615
For me, precision medicine comes
from a very special place.
