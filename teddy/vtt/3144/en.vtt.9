00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:32.209
and once a week, one member
of the group gets the money,

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.427
and they can spend it on
whatever they need to.

00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:37.038
And there's also something
called "acequias,"

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:41.404
and that is a Spanish word, but it
comes from the North African Arabic;

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:43.056
"saqiya" means "water wheel."

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.696
And what the acequia is
is a sharing system for scarce water.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.062
It's migrated from North Africa to Spain,

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:53.698
and from Spain to the west
of the United States,

00:04:53.722 --> 00:04:55.150
where it still is used.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:59.646
And it shares water by need

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.818
rather than by who was there first.
