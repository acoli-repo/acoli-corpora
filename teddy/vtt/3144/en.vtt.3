and locals picked them and said,
"You are my guest, I am now your broker."

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:37.764
And they had to do business
through the local broker,

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:41.273
and if they went around that
and didn't do business through the broker,

00:01:41.297 --> 00:01:45.664
they could go to court,
and the deal would be canceled,

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.526
and they would be thrown out of town.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.304
And through this mechanism,
everyone prospered.

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:54.357

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.941
and say, "Ah! That's a mutual aid society.

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:00.596
That's a share-the-wealth free market."
