00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:32.593
and we don't have to copy
that military-industrialist complex,

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:35.063
because Africa can do things differently

00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:38.784
and restore the humanity of the world.

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:42.051
And so what I want to suggest here

00:08:43.305 --> 00:08:44.925
is that we have an opportunity,

00:08:46.314 --> 00:08:49.816
that we are all here
in the mutual landscape

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:52.443
to be able to do things,

00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:56.484
and that the journey starts now.

00:08:57.318 --> 00:08:58.476
Thank you very much.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.988
