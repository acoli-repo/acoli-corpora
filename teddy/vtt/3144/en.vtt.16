00:07:56.026 --> 00:08:00.345
because next month,
September 12 to be exact,

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:05.299
is the 40th anniversary of his murder
by the South African state.

00:08:06.097 --> 00:08:08.139
And you can read the quote.

00:08:08.163 --> 00:08:11.208
He basically said that
we're not here to compete.

00:08:12.064 --> 00:08:15.983
And I love this quote: "... to make us
a community of brothers and sisters

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:19.096
jointly involved in the quest
for a composite answer

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.960
to the varied problems of life."

00:08:21.848 --> 00:08:25.016
And he also said that
"the great powers of the world

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.870
have done wonders in giving us
an industrial and military look, ..."

00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:32.593
and we don't have to copy
that military-industrialist complex,
