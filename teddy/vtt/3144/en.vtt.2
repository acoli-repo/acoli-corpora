00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.862
And fortunately, there's
actually an easy answer,

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:08.925
because the Arab lawyer
and traveler Ibn Battuta

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:13.765
traveled down the east coast
of Africa in the 14th century,

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.420
and what he found when he got
to Mogadishu was a market,

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.947
and he wrote about it.

00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:22.940
And basically, merchant ships
came to the harbor,

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:24.823
and they weren't even allowed to land.

00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:26.724
They had to drop anchor in the harbor,

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:28.386
and boats came out to them,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.224
and locals picked them and said,
"You are my guest, I am now your broker."
