00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:02.261
So what I'm doing

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.574
is a thought experiment.

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:10.578
Now you may know of or have read

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.016
this book by this guy.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.918
It's probably the first
and maybe the only bestseller

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.547
ever written about economics.

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:21.092
And you probably know a bit
about what it says.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.637
It talks about how nations
all over the world will prosper

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.647
through the individual pursuit
of individual profit.
