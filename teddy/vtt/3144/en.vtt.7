Every merchant, when you ask them,
"How did you get started in global trade?"

00:03:32.507 --> 00:03:35.678
they say, "Well, when
my master settled me."

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:40.463
And when I finally got it into my head
to ask, "What is this 'settling?'"

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.161
it turns out that when you've
done your apprenticeship

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:44.704
with someone you work for,

00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:48.722
they are required -- required --
to set you up in business.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.297
That means paying your rent
for two or three years

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.349
and giving you a cash infusion

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:56.240
so you can go out in the world
and start trading.

00:03:57.018 --> 00:04:00.116
That's locally generated
venture capital. Right?
