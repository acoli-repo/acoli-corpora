00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:02.104
But the interesting reality is
that when I asked further,

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:05.078
that's not what grew the market at all.

00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:08.681
There's a behind-the-scenes principle

00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:12.530
that enables this market to grow.

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.529
And they do claim -- you know,
this is an interesting juxtaposition

00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:19.940
of the King James Bible
and "How To Sell Yourself."

00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:22.628
That's what they say is their message.

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:26.769
But in reality, this market
is governed by a sharing principle.

00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:32.483
Every merchant, when you ask them,
"How did you get started in global trade?"
