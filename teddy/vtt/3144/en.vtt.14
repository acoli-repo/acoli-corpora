00:06:56.707 --> 00:07:01.745
by the thesis of cassava and capitalism,

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.527
that cassava has to be processed
in order not to be poisonous,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.275
and I would argue that, similarly,

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:14.338
the market economy needs to be processed
in order to be fair to everyone.

00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:21.402
So we have to look at what I call
the "bottom down economy."

00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:25.266
These are these sharing models
that exist out there

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.635
that need to be propagated
and used and scaled.

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:30.930
OK?
