Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where I can just lie down with my belly down,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I can basically look everywhere I want,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
see every movie I've always wanted to see.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in the subway in New York when you're reading,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there's something really soothing and easy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
