00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.976
and then at nine weeks
is really kind of a little human being.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.976
The marvel of this information:

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.368
How do we actually have
this biological mechanism

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:38.692
inside our body

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:40.605
to actually see this information?

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.916
I'm going to show you
something pretty unique.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.933
Here's a human heart at 25 days.

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:46.550
It's just basically two strands.

00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.276
And like this magnificent origami,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.976
cells are developing at one million cells
per second at four weeks,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.976
as it's just folding on itself.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.781
Within five weeks, you start to see
the early atrium and the early ventricles.

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:01.025
Six weeks, these folds are now beginning
