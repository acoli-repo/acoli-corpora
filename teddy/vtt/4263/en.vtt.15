00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.976
of how do these instruction sets
not make these mistakes

as they build what is us?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.976
Then you start to take

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.239
Take a look at this
little tuft of capillaries.

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.976

of vessels inside your body.

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:57.444
And only one mile is visible.

00:07:57.468 --> 00:07:59.976
59,999 miles

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.976
that are basically bringing
nutrients and taking waste away.
