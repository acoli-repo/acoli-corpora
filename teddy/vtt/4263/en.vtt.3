and he built the hardware --
Paul Lauterbur --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.533
then went onto win the Nobel

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:37.976
I got the data.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.660
And I'm going to show you
a sample of the piece,

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:41.976
"From Conception to Birth."

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:47.443
(Music)

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:50.467
[From Conception to Birth]

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:56.784
[Oocyte]

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.968
