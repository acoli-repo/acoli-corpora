00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.687
and therefore, it becomes
transparent, as opposed to opaque.

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:04.976
So perfectly organized a structure,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.514
it was hard not to attribute
divinity to it.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:12.636
Because we kept on seeing this
in different parts of the body.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.976
One of the opportunities I had

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.381
was one person was working
on a really interesting

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.976
micromagnetic resonance
imaging machine with the NIH.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.976
And what we were going to do

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.976
was scan a new project

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.830
on the development of the fetus
from conception to birth

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.528
using these new technologies.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:30.509
So I wrote the algorithms and code,
