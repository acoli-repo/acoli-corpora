00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
And as we kept on working on this data,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.976
looking at small clusters of the body,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.976
these little pieces of tissue

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.932
that were the trophoblasts
coming off of the blastocyst,

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.918
all of a sudden burrowing itself
into the side of the uterus,

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:15.276
saying, "I'm here to stay."

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.176
Having conversation and communications

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.076
with the estrogens, the progesterones,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.705
saying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,"

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.066
building this incredible trilinear fetus

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.176
that becomes, within 44 days,
something that you can recognize,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.976
and then at nine weeks
is really kind of a little human being.
