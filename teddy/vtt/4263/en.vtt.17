00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:31.288
Every six months
until they're six years old,

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:33.976
we're going to be doing
about 250 children,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.703
watching exactly how the gyri
and the sulci of the brains fold

00:08:37.727 --> 00:08:39.764
to see how this magnificent development

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:42.376
actually turns into memories
and the marvel that is us.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.176
And it's not just our own existence,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.042
but how does the woman's body understand

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.747
to have genetic structure
that not only builds her own,

00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:51.276
but then has the understanding

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.976
that allows her to become

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.976
a walking immunological,
cardiovascular system

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.976
that basically is a mobile system

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.835
that can actually nurture,

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:01.976
treat this child with a kind of marvel
