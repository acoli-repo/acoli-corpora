Six weeks, these folds are now beginning

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.206
with the papilla
on the inside of the heart

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.676
actually being able to pull down
each one of those valves in your heart

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.976
until you get a mature heart --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.889
and then basically the development
of the entire human body.

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:15.976
The magic of the mechanisms
inside each genetic structure

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.976
saying exactly where
that nerve cell should go --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.006
the complexity of these,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.927
the mathematical models
of how these things are indeed done

00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:25.822
are beyond human comprehension.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.769
Even though I am a mathematician,

00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:29.708
I look at this with marvel

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.976
of how do these instruction sets
not make these mistakes
