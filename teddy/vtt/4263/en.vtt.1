00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.976
but also things that allowed us
to see things about the body

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.976
that just made you marvel.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.976
I remember one of the first times
we were looking at collagen.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.976
And your entire body, everything --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.976
your hair, skin, bone, nails --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.976
everything is made of collagen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.928
And it's a kind of rope-like structure
that twirls and swirls like this.

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.157
And the only place that collagen
changes its structure

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.957
is in the cornea of your eye.

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.356
In your eye,
it becomes a grid formation,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.687
and therefore, it becomes
transparent, as opposed to opaque.
