00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.714
I was offered a position
as associate professor of medicine

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:06.546
and chief of scientific visualization

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.547
at Yale University

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.180
in the department of medicine.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:12.976
And my job was to write
many of the algorithms and code

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.976
for NASA to do virtual surgery

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.976
in preparation for the astronauts
going into deep-space flight,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
so they could be kept in robotic pods.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.906
One of the fascinating things
about what we were working on

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.948
is that we were seeing,
using new scanning technologies,

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:27.953
things that had never been seen before.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.551
Not only in disease management,

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.976
but also things that allowed us
to see things about the body
