00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.976
that are basically bringing
nutrients and taking waste away.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.661
The complexity of building
that within a single system

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.570
is, again, beyond any comprehension
or any existing mathematics today.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.976
And then instructions set,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.785
from the brain to every other
part of the body --

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:15.663
look at the complexity of the folding.

00:08:15.687 --> 00:08:17.076
Where does this intelligence

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.915
of knowing that a fold can
actually hold more information,

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:22.531
so as you actually watch
the baby's brain grow.

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:24.699
And this is one of the things we're doing.

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:26.276
We're launching two new studies

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.073
of scanning babies' brains
from the moment they're born.

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:31.288
Every six months
until they're six years old,
