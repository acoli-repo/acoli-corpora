Maybe we'll have devices that enable
togetherness and serendipity.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:31.808
I really hope so.

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:37.037
And, you know, I like to think
that if strong AI ever really exists,

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:40.952
they'll probably enjoy
our weird relationship drama

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:45.777
the same way that you and I love to obsess
about the "Real Housewives of Wherever."

00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:47.340
And finally, there's medicine.

00:09:47.364 --> 00:09:51.337
I think a lot about how developments
in genetic medicine

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.398
could improve outcomes for people
with cancer or dementia,

00:09:55.422 --> 00:10:01.192
and maybe one day, your hundredth birthday
will be just another milestone
