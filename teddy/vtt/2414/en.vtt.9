and technological speculation.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:41.405
And then I go back, and I try to imagine
what it would actually be like

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.541
to be inside that city.

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:48.209
So my process kind of begins
and ends with imagination,

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:52.543
and it's like my imagination
is two pieces of bread

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:54.385
in a research sandwich.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:59.160

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.563
I try to live in the world
through the eyes of my characters
