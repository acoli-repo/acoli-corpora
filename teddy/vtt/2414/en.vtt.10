00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.563
I try to live in the world
through the eyes of my characters

00:05:02.587 --> 00:05:06.281
and try to see how they navigate
their own personal challenges

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.623
in the context of the space
that I've created.

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:11.637
What do they smell? What do they touch?

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.585
What's it like to fall in love
inside a smart city?

00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:17.768
What do you see when you
look out your window,

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:21.283
and does it depend on how the window's
software interacts with your mood?

00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:25.431
And finally, I ask myself
how a future brilliant city

00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:30.883
would ensure that nobody is homeless
and nobody slips through the cracks.
