00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:31.127
for the previous generation?

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:34.064
So finally: basically,
I'm here to tell you,

00:10:34.088 --> 00:10:35.950
people talk about the future

00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:39.800
as though it's either going to be
a technological wonderland

00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:43.885
or some kind of apocalyptic poop barbecue.

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:44.998
(Laughter)

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:47.957
But the truth is, it's not going
to be either of those things.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.916
It's going to be in the middle. It's going
to be both. It's going to be everything.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.107
The one thing we do know

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.556
is that the future is going
to be incredibly weird.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.837
Just think about how weird
the early 21st century would appear

00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:01.116
to someone from the early 20th.
