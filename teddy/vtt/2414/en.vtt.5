and upheavals and transformations.

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:33.988
And I pair that with
an attention to detail,

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:37.627
because the details are where we live.

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:41.515
We tell the story of our world
through the tools we create

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.585
and the spaces that we live in.

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.183
And at this point, it's helpful
to know a couple of terms

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:50.642
that science fiction writers
use all of the time:

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:55.018
"future history"
and "second-order effects."

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.523
Now, future history is basically
just what it sounds like.

00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:01.898
It is a chronology of things
that haven't happened yet,
