00:09:55.422 --> 00:10:01.192
and maybe one day, your hundredth birthday
will be just another milestone

00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:04.987
on the way to another two or three
decades of healthy, active life.

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.469
Maybe the toilet of the future
that I mentioned

00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:09.997
will improve health outcomes
for a lot of people,

00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:11.864
including people in parts of the world

00:10:11.888 --> 00:10:15.311
where they don't have these complicated
sewer systems that I mentioned.

00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:17.591
But also, as a transgender person,

00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:22.572
I like to think: What if we make advances
in understanding the endocrine system

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:25.587
that improve the options for trans people,

00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:29.503
the same way that hormones and surgeries
expanded the options

00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:31.127
for the previous generation?
