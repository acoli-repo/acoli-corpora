No, that's not a picture of it,
but it's a fun picture I took in a bar.

00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:03.874
(Laughter)

00:08:03.898 --> 00:08:08.492
And I got really carried away
imagining the bars, restaurants, cafés

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.675
that you could only find your way inside

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.935
if you had the correct
augmented reality hardware.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:16.538
But again, second-order effects:

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.720
in a world shaped by augmented reality,

00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:21.785
what kind of new communities will we have,

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:24.717
what kind of new crimes
that we haven't even thought of yet?

00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.269
OK, like, let's say that you and I
are standing next to each other,

00:08:28.293 --> 00:08:32.076
and you think that we're
in a noisy sports bar,
