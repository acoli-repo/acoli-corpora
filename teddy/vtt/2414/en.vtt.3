00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:30.053
I've found it really liberating
and fun to do that.

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.299
It's a way of vaccinating yourself

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:35.989
against the worst possible case
of future shock.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.227
It's also a source of empowerment,

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:43.107
because you cannot prepare for something
that you haven't already visualized.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.298
But there's something
that you need to know.

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.842
You don't predict the future;

00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:51.588
you imagine the future.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.897
So as a science fiction writer

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:58.676
whose stories often take place
years or even centuries from now,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.631
I've found that people are really hungry
for visions of the future
