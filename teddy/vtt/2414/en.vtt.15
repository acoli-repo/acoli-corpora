00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:32.228
leads to a smart battery
that could help power your home?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.512
But back to the city of the future.

00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:36.123
How do people navigate the space?

00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:39.933
If there's no streets, how do people
even make sense of the geography?

00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:42.403
I like to think of a place
where there are spaces

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.875
that are partially only in virtual reality

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.828
that maybe you need
special hardware to even discover.

00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:52.384
Like for one story, I came up with a thing
called "the cloudscape interface,"

00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:56.777
which I described as a chrome spider
that plugs into your head

00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:58.507
using temporal nodes.

00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:01.942
No, that's not a picture of it,
but it's a fun picture I took in a bar.
