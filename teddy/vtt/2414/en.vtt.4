00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.631
I've found that people are really hungry
for visions of the future

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.018
that are both colorful and lived in,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.916
but I found that research on its own
is not enough to get me there.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.545
Instead, I use a mixture
of active dreaming

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.891
and awareness of cutting-edge trends
in science and technology

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:21.115
and also insight into human history.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.437
I think a lot about what I know
of human nature

00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:27.736
and the way that people have responded
in the past to huge changes

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.387
and upheavals and transformations.
