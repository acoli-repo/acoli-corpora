00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:30.883
would ensure that nobody is homeless
and nobody slips through the cracks.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.195
And here's where
future history comes in handy,

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.655
because cities don't just spring up
overnight like weeds.

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:39.607
They arise and transform.

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:45.710
They bear the scars and ornaments
of wars, migrations,

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.402
economic booms, cultural awakenings.

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:50.905
A future city should have monuments, yeah,

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:54.807
but it should also have layers
of past architecture,

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:56.255
repurposed buildings

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.878
and all of the signs of how
we got to this place.
