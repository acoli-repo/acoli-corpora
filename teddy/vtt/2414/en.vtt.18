00:08:57.213 --> 00:09:01.205
all combine to drag you down deeper
and deeper rabbit holes

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:05.231
into bad relationships and worse politics.

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.226
But then I think about
the conversations that I've had

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.141
with people who work on AI,

00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:13.837
and what I always hear from them
is that the smarter AI gets,

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:16.144
the better it is at making connections.

00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:20.517
So maybe the social media
of the future will be better.

00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:25.481
Maybe it'll help us to form healthier,
less destructive relationships.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:30.024
Maybe we'll have devices that enable
togetherness and serendipity.
