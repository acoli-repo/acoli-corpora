00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.076
So how does the history of the future,
all of that trial and error,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.205
lead to a better way
to go to the bathroom?

00:07:03.748 --> 00:07:05.214
There are companies right now

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:07.754
who are experimenting
with a kind of cleaning wand

00:07:07.778 --> 00:07:09.623
that can substitute for toilet paper,

00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:12.837
using compressed air
or sanitizing sprays to clean you off.

00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:17.671
But what if those things looked
more like flowers than technology?

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:21.665
What if your toilet
could analyze your waste

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.811
and let you know if your microbiome
might need a little tune-up?

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.800
What if today's experiments
with turning human waste into fuel

00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:32.228
leads to a smart battery
that could help power your home?
