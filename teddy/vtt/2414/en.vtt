Every science fiction writer

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:07.990
has a story about a time
when the future arrived too soon.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.102
I have a lot of those stories.

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:12.813
Like, OK, for example:

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:16.855
years ago, I was writing a story
where the government

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.009
starts using drones to kill people.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:25.460
I thought that this was
a really intense, futuristic idea,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:28.482
but by the time the story was published,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.694
the government was already
using drones to kill people.
