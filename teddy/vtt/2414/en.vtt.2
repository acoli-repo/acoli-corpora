00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:01.220
But now, nobody knows
what the world is going to look like

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.307
even in just a couple years,

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.911
and there are so many scary apparitions
lurking on the horizon.

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:11.648
From climate catastrophe
to authoritarianism,

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:15.034
everybody is obsessed with apocalypses,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:19.103
even though the world ends
all the time, and we keep going.

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:23.741
Don't be afraid to think about the future,
to dream about the future,

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.620
to write about the future.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:30.053
I've found it really liberating
and fun to do that.
