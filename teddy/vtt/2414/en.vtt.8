00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:03.021
I try to picture a green city
with vertical farms

00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:07.647
and structures that are partially
grown rather than built

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:10.270
and walkways instead of streets,

00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:13.754
because nobody gets around
by car anymore --

00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:17.753
a city that lives and breathes.

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:22.204
And, you know, I kind of start
by daydreaming the wildest stuff

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.214
that I can possibly come up with,

00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:26.899
and then I go back into research mode,

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:29.348
and I try to make it as plausible as I can

00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:34.191
by looking at a mixture
of urban futurism, design porn
