and you think that we're
in a noisy sports bar,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.307
and I think we're in a highbrow salon

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.334
with a string quartet
talking about Baudrillard.

00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:42.275
I can't possibly imagine
what might go wrong in that scenario.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.798
Like, it's just -- I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:08:45.822 --> 00:08:47.350
And then there's social media.

00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:51.519
I can imagine some pretty
frickin' dystopian scenarios

00:08:51.543 --> 00:08:54.054
where things like internet quizzes,

00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:57.189
dating apps, horoscopes, bots,

00:08:57.213 --> 00:09:01.205
all combine to drag you down deeper
and deeper rabbit holes
