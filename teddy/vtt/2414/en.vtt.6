00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:01.898
It is a chronology of things
that haven't happened yet,

00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:05.040
like Robert A. Heinlein's
famous story cycle,

00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:08.423
which came with a detailed chart
of upcoming events

00:03:08.447 --> 00:03:10.956
going up into the year 2100.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.117
Or, for my most recent novel,

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:15.418
I came up with a really
complicated time line

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:18.861
that goes all the way to the 33rd century

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.175
and ends with people
living on another planet.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:27.984
Meanwhile, a second-order effect
is basically the kind of thing

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:33.620
that happens after the consequences
of a new technology or a huge change.
