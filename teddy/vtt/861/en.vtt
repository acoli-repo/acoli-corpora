00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, I'm going to show you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
again something about our diets.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I would like to know what the audience is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and so who of you ever ate insects?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's quite a lot.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But still, you're not representing

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the overall population of the Earth.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But this is quite good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?
