00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.114
is exerted by the runner's legs,

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:34.341
and according to Newton's Second
Law of Motion,

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:38.580
force is the product of mass
times acceleration.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.346
And Newton's Third Law states

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.623
that for every action,

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.759
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:46.744
So, that means running requires

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:48.546
having a ground to push off from,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.679
and the ground pushes back
against the runner's foot.

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:55.210
So, flying would actually be

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:57.390
more similar to swimming.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:01.317
