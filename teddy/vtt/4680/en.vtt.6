00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:00.097
You'd need to wrap yourself up

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:01.741
to keep your core body temperature

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.566
above 95 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.436
otherwise you'd start shivering violently,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.145
gradually becoming mentally confused

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.789
and eventually drop out of the sky

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:10.925
due to loss of muscle control

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.179
from hypothermia!

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:16.197
Now, the Ideal Gas Law implies

00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:17.903
that as the pressure decreases,

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.732
gas volume increases.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:21.995
So, if you were to fly
straight up too quickly,

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.596
the inert gas in your body
would rapidly expand

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.433
the way soda fizzes up when shaken.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.008
The phenomenon is called "the bends,"
