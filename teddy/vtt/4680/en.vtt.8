00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:01.150
including flying cops

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.319
ready to hand you a ticket

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:04.528
if you don't follow
the flying rules, buddy.

00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:07.025
Now remember, if you
have a collision mid-air

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.941
that knocks you unconscious,

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.050
you would experience free fall

00:04:11.074 --> 00:04:12.933
until you hit the ground.

00:04:14.674 --> 00:04:17.551
Without society or the laws of physics,

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.960
flying would be a totally
awesome ability to have.

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.775
But, even if we could
all just float around

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:23.757
a few feet above the ground

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.465
and only moving at a snail's pace,

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:28.992
I'm telling you, it's still
a cool ability that I'd want,

00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:30.738
wouldn't you?
