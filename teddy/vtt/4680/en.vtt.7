00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.008
The phenomenon is called "the bends,"

00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:31.161
decompression sickness,

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:32.873
or "divers disease"

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:35.580
since deep sea scuba
divers experience this

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:37.523
when they come up too quickly.

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.379
This results in pain,

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:40.379
paralysis,

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:41.606
or death,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.641
depending on how foamy your blood becomes.

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:46.342
Okay, well, let's say you want to fly

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:47.986
just a few meters above the ground

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.820
where you can still see the road signs

00:03:49.844 --> 00:03:51.306
and breath oxygen with ease.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.346
You'll still need goggles and a helmet

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.980
to protect you from birds,

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:55.953
insects,

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:56.757
street signs,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:57.693
electrical wires,

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.550
and other flying humans,

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:01.150
including flying cops
