00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.388
propelling us forward.

00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.591
The ground is solid.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.846
By definition, it means the particles

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.181
are essentially locked into place

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:40.431
and must push back instead
of getting out of the way,

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:43.644
but water is liquid and flows easily.

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:44.730
When we move our limbs

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.231
to push back against the water,

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.636
a part of the water molecules

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.403
can just slide past one another

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:50.894
instead of pushing back.

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.528
Now, let's think about flying.

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:54.448
Air has a lot more free space

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:56.863
for particles to move past one another,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.910
so even more of our energy
would be wasted.

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.176
We would need to push
a lot of air backwards
