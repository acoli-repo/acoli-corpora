00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.176
We would need to push
a lot of air backwards

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.977
in order to move forward.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.833
Astronauts move around in shuttles

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:07.905
in zero gravity when
they're in outer space

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.915
by pulling on handles installed
on the ceiling walls

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.644
and floors of the shuttle.

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:16.470
Now, imagine you were
given the ability to float.

00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:19.263
How would you move
around in the middle of the street?

00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:20.764
Well, you wouldn't get very far

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:23.036
by swimming in air, would you?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.385
Nah, I don't think so!

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.979
Now, assuming you were
granted the ability to float

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.733
and the speed to move around efficiently,

00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:32.600
let's discuss the height of your flight.
