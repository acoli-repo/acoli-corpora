00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:32.600
let's discuss the height of your flight.

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:34.778
According to the Ideal Gas Law,

00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:36.322
P-V N-R-T,

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.823
pressure and temperature has
a positive correlation,

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:42.203
meaning they increase
and decrease together.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.497
This is because the air expands in volume

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.815
with less pressure,

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.247
so the molecules have more
room to wander around

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.920
without colliding into each other
and creating heat.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.087
Since the atmospheric
pressure is a lot lower

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.306
in high altitudes,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.866
it would be freezing cold

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.644
if you were flying above the clouds.

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:00.097
You'd need to wrap yourself up
