Michael Phelps is currently
the fastest human in water

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.964
and the most decorated
Olympian of all time.

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:06.690
Guess how fast he swims?

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:09.359
The answer may surprise you.

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:11.236
His fastest recorded speed is

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.089
less than 5 miles per hour.

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:17.368
A child on the ground can easily outrun

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:18.660
Michael Phelps in water,

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.537
but why is that?

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.224
Well, let's go back
to Newton's Third Law of Motion.

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:24.792
When we run, we move forward

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.087
by pushing against the ground
with our feet

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.397
and the ground pushes back,

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.388
propelling us forward.
