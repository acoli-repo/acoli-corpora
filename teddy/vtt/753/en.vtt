Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
starts with a conversation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I would like to share with you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with too much time on my hands.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.
