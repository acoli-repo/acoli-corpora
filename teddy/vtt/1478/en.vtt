Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the typographically hysterical amongst us.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the threads that seems to have come through

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
loud and clear in the last couple of days

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And how do you bring those two things together?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
