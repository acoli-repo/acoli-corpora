00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.001
When was the last time
you walked down the street

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.253
in a city with new buildings?

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:10.840
I want to talk to you about the problem

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.635
that we all know exists
in our towns and cities.

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:20.141
We're increasingly surrounded
by characterless buildings.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.145
I believe we're living through
an epidemic of boringness.

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:25.897
(Laughter)

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:31.110
