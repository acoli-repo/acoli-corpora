Forbes's best workplaces for diversity
enjoy 24 percent higher revenue growth.

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:06.938
And yet, here we are in 2018,

00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:11.747
and there are only three black CEOs
in the Fortune 500.

00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:14.133
And if your name is Molly or Connor,

00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:18.409
you've got a 14 percent better chance
of getting a callback on your resume

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.673
than if your name is Shanice or DeShawn.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:26.150
And all of this, despite
the fact that by 2045,

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:31.314
America is projected to be
a minority-majority country.
