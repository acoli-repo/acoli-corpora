00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:31.547
Diversity is a numbers game.

00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:34.089
Inclusion is about impact.

00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:36.886
Companies can mandate diversity,

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.218
but they have to cultivate inclusion.

00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:42.516
And if inclusion is what you're after,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.268
you've got to calculate
some slightly different numbers.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.687
How about 30 percent?

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.827
Because that's the point
that research shows

00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:55.395
at which the voices of minorities
actually begin to be heard.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:58.133
If you want a real problem,

00:08:58.157 --> 00:09:00.232
you're going to need
real numbers to fix it,
