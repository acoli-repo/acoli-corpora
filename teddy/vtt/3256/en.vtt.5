00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.739
but what was different about it was,

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:35.541
we also challenged Davidson
to say that if you don't do this,

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:38.470
we will question
your commitment to diversity.

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:40.399
It was a real problem.

00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:42.234
We put some real numbers to it.

00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:44.479
We gave them some real consequences.

00:02:44.503 --> 00:02:46.773
Well, the campus went absolutely nuts.

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.962
But fortunately, in the middle of this,

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:51.912
Davidson got a new president,

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.059
and that president was
single-minded about racism, too.

00:02:55.632 --> 00:02:57.776
And so, he created a task force

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.948
to address the issues in Project '87.
