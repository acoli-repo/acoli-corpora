00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:30.722
with white Davidson on one side,
black Davidson on the other side,

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:34.047
and, as black students lived
on the white side of the tracks,

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.561
we got used to being stopped
in downtown and asked for ID,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.353
until the police memorized our faces.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.452
But fortunately,
that didn't take too long,

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:47.132
because out of 1,200 students,
only 52 of us were black.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:48.963
There was one black professor

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:50.663
and one black assistant dean.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.072
Things weren't a lot better on campus.

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:55.954
Well, I wasn't OK with this.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.507
And so, I started writing things.

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.516
And then I started yelling things.
