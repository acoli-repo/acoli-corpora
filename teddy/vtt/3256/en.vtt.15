America is projected to be
a minority-majority country.

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:33.448
Here's the thing:

00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:36.890
the business case for diversity,
as it stands today,

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.917
doesn't really speak to any problem.

00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:42.229

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.166
about racial diversity

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.416
is if it has a problem that is urgent
and relative to somebody

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.999

you're going to need those, right?

00:07:59.054 --> 00:08:02.295
Well, let's talk about some real numbers.
