00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:04.777
Everybody has that one friend --

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.625
you know, the single-minded one,

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.824
the one who, no matter
what the question is,

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:14.012
always finds a way to make the answer
whatever it is she's single-minded about.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.982
I'm that friend.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.779
(Laughter)

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:20.386
And the thing that I'm single-minded about

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.592
is racism.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.436
If someone were to ask me, "So, Janet,
got any plans for the 4th of July?"

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.529
I'm subject to answer, "Yeah,
I'm going to binge-watch 'Roots.'"

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:30.609
(Laughter)
