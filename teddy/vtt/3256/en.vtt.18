00:08:58.157 --> 00:09:00.232
you're going to need
real numbers to fix it,

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:02.415
and if you're not willing
to set real numbers,

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:05.911
then maybe you're not real serious
about diversity and inclusion.

00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:07.711
That brings me to my third point:

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:10.506
real consequences.

00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:12.314
Think about this:

00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:16.395
when salespeople forget what they're doing
and don't come up with their numbers,

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:17.580
what do we do?

00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:20.510
We give them a little time,
maybe we give them some training.

00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:22.985
But then if they don't hit
those numbers eventually,

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:24.474
we fire them.

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:27.696
However, when you start talking
about diversity and inclusion,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.729
we use terms like "accountability."
