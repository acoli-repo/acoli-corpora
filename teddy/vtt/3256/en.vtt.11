Now, I'm aware that diversity
is bigger than race,

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:33.614
and racism is bigger than America.

00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:37.424
But racial discrimination
is the most prominent form,

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:39.941
and Lord knows America is
the absolute best at it.

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:43.956
So what if, though, what if

00:05:44.703 --> 00:05:49.143
we worked in diverse
and inclusive environments

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:51.298
that we had something
to do something with?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.517
And since we spend
one-third of our lives at work,

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:59.248
what if we did that with people
who didn't look like us?

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:02.936
I think the world would be
a totally different place outside of work.
