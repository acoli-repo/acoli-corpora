00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.948
to address the issues in Project '87.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.907
And several months after that,

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:06.427
we produced a 77-page report.

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:12.149
That report was the foundation
for all the change that came after it.

00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:15.684
Now, I wasn't there to see that change,

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.086
because, actually, in 1985,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.395
I graduated.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.604
(Applause)

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:29.478
You are looking at the three
happiest people on the planet that day,

00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.386
because I am leaving.
