00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.549
with the CEO and senior executives,

00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:35.909
and a lot of times those conversations
turn to diversity and inclusion,

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:38.530
which, of course, I'm always
happy to talk about.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.691
But after quite a few
of these conversations,

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:43.205
I've come to a conclusion:

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:47.098
I believe that business
is in a position to do something

00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:49.405
that no other entity can do.

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:53.325
Business can dismantle racism.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:55.798
Now, colleges can't do it.

00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:58.353
There aren't but 5,000 of them
in the United States

00:04:58.377 --> 00:05:00.563
and only 20 million students enrolled.
