(Laughter)

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.509
Or if they said, "Janet,
I've got a joke for you:

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.382
Why'd the chicken cross the road?"

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:37.567
"Uh, was it a black chicken?

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.204
Probably gentrification."

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:41.428
(Laughter)

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:45.553
(Applause)

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:53.629
But for me, single-mindedness
is not just caring about something.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:57.414
It's caring about something enough
to do something about it.

00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:01.081
It's not just thinking, it's doing.
