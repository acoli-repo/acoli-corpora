00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.415
What I want to do this afternoon

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:05.280
is something a little different than what's scheduled.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.226
Foreign policy, you can figure that out

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:10.260
by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.094
but — (Laughter) —

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:15.656
I want to talk about young people and structure,

00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:17.623
young people and structure.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:19.871
This was last Wednesday afternoon

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.375
at a school in Brooklyn, New York,

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:25.309
at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.146
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:31.613
They were around me in three directions.
