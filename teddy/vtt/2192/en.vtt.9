32 new fluent speakers,

00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.371
some of whom,
like Donna's daughter Elisabeth,

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.276
are teaching Tunica to their children.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.361
These new speakers are creating content,

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:40.866
Facebook videos and also memes.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.724
(Laughter)

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.545
(Laughter)

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.588
(Laughter)

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.436
And the more they publish,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.237
the more they inspire other
Tunica people to get involved.

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:58.053
Recently, a tribal member living in Texas
wrote Elisabeth on Facebook,

00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:00.611
asking how to say "bless these lands."
