removing indigenous children
from their families

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.707
and forcing them into boarding schools
where they were given English names

00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.154
and punished for speaking their languages.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.832
Assimilation was a complement to genocide.

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.457
Seven thousand languages are alive today,

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.933
but few are recognized
by their own governments

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:50.291
or supported online.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.474
So for people from the vast
majority of cultures,

00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:56.498
globalization remains
profoundly alienating.

00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.452
It means giving up your language
for someone else's.
