Then, in the early 2000s,
Cornish speakers found one another online

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:05.236
and leveraged digital spaces
to speak on a daily basis.

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.618
From there, they organized
weekly or monthly events

00:03:08.642 --> 00:03:11.418
where they could gather
and speak in public.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.799
Today, some schools teach Cornish.

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.268
There are Cornish language signs,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:18.720
ice-cream commercials,

00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:21.021
Wikipedia, and even memes.

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.466
(Laughter)

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:29.761
