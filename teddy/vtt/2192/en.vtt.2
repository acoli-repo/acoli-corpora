00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.452
It means giving up your language
for someone else's.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.711
And if nothing changes,

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:07.009
as many as 3,000 languages
could disappear in 80 years.

00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:09.844
But things are changing.

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:11.593
Around the world,

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.188
people are reviving ancestral languages

00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:16.212
and rebuilding their cultures.

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:18.799
As far as we know,

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:23.410
language reclamation began in the 1800s
when, at a time of rising antisemitism,

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:26.561
Jewish communities looked
to their ancestral language, Hebrew,

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.815
as a means of cultural revival.
