it was well preserved in books
of Jewish religion and philosophy.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.672
So Jewish activists studied
and taught it to their children,

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:43.140
raising the first native speakers
in nearly 100 generations.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.759
Today, it's the mother tongue
of five million Jews.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:49.537
And at least for me,

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:53.434
an assimilated English-speaking member
of the Jewish diaspora,

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.950
a pillar of cultural sovereignty.

00:01:57.315 --> 00:01:59.617
Two thousand years later,

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.841
we're still here.
