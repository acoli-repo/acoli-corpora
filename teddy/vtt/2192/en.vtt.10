It was for a yard sign,

00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:06.188
so she could show her neighbors
that her culture is alive

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:07.545
and thriving today.

00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:10.537
Now, Hebrew, Cornish and Tunica

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:15.345
are just three examples from a groundswell
of language activism on every continent.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.610
And whether they're Jèrriais speakers
from the Channel Isles,

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:22.887
or Kenyan sign language
speakers from Nairobi,

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:26.220
all communities working
to preserve or reclaim a language

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:29.124
have one thing in common: media,

00:05:29.148 --> 00:05:31.416
so their language
can be shared and taught.
