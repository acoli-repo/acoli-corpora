00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.841
we're still here.

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:04.069
Now, until recently,

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:06.580
Hebrew's reawakening was an anomaly.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:09.239
Few languages are
as well preserved as ours was,

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.017
and the creation of Israel,

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.675
the first Jewish state
in over 1,000 years,

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.366
provided a space for Hebrew's daily use.

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:20.522
In other words, most cultures
just weren't given a chance.

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.709
(Video) Good evening, I'm Elizabeth

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.149
and I live in Cornwall.

00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:26.329
That was Cornish,

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:28.338
the ancestral language of Cornwall,

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.822
which today is technically
a county in southern England.
