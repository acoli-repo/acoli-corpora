00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.986
This was a Monday,
and this is what we found.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.184
The destruction you saw on TV,
one more hurricane,

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.684
but this destruction was real.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.981
More than 95 percent of the electricity
in the island was gone.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.860
Every single electric post was gone.

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:18.934
All the cell towers were gone.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.803
You couldn't communicate with anybody.

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:25.066
You couldn't find anybody the moment
you moved away from San Juan.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.374
Even in San Juan, we had issues
trying to use our cell phones.
