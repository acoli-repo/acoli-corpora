but somebody at FEMA was not able

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:34.457
And what we did was use fine kitchens.

00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:37.101
José Enrique, one of my favorite

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.876

And that's what we did.

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.587
We began feeding the people
of Puerto Rico, on a Monday.

00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.945
On a Monday, we did a thousand meals,
sancocho, an amazing stew
