00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.701
and I was just able
to get into a meeting at FEMA,

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:08.072
where many of the main
NGO partners were having a conversation

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:11.797
about how to feed the island
in the weeks to come,

00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:16.113
but the urgency was right now,
in this minute, in this second,

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.125
and we almost had three million people
that needed to be fed.

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.863
So we began doing what we do best.

00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:24.583
We went to see the sources of food,

00:02:24.607 --> 00:02:27.749
and I was able to see that the private
industry actually was ready

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.031
and prepared and thriving,

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:32.570
but somebody at FEMA was not able
even to be aware of that.
