00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.199
but even more, I love to feed the many.

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:35.435
Here, right after the hurricane,

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:39.901
like we'd done many times before
after an earthquake in Haiti

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:43.294
or Sandy or others,

00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:46.466
I had this sense of urgency to be there

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.263
and to try to feed one person,

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.018
and always, you have crazy friends
that want to join you

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.779
in those impossible endeavors.

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:56.969
I'm always surrounded by amazing friends
that only help me to be better.

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:59.613
Nate came next to me.

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.986
This was a Monday,
and this is what we found.
