00:07:56.146 --> 00:08:00.241
Vieques and Culebra,
two islands far away from the island --

00:08:00.265 --> 00:08:02.289
somebody had to be feeding them.

00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:05.873
We didn't only bring food and make
a hotel kitchen operation in Vieques

00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:07.664
and bring daily food to Culebra.

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.707
We brought the first
water purification system

00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.992
to the island of Vieques,

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:14.937
where we could be filtering
one gallon per minute.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.248
All of a sudden, big problems
become very simple,

00:08:17.272 --> 00:08:19.272
low-hanging fruit solutions,

00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:23.645
only by doing, not planning
and meeting in a very big building.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.209
(Laughter)

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:26.932
And then we found creative ways.

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:29.582
We needed helicopters. We asked. We got.

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:32.439
We needed planes. We asked,
we paid, and we got.
