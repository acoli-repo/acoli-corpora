Salvation Army came and asked me
for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night

00:14:30.763 --> 00:14:32.863
for a local elderly shop.

00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:35.868
I love to help the Salvation Army,

00:14:35.892 --> 00:14:41.174
but in my world, they are the ones
who are supposed to be helping us

00:14:41.198 --> 00:14:43.427
to answer those calls of help.

00:14:44.353 --> 00:14:47.725
Thursday morning
is when I wake up super worried

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:51.376
that actually we didn't have
the plan to feed the island.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.551
And some people will say
maybe you are making the problem

00:14:54.575 --> 00:14:56.614
bigger than it was.

00:14:56.638 --> 00:15:00.259
Well, we had hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of organizations
