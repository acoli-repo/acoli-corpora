00:14:56.638 --> 00:15:00.259
Well, we had hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of organizations

00:15:00.283 --> 00:15:04.099
knocking on our door,
asking for a tray of food,

00:15:04.123 --> 00:15:07.160
so if that's not proof
that the need was real ...

00:15:07.184 --> 00:15:11.099
We cannot be feeding people
in America anymore with MREs

00:15:11.123 --> 00:15:13.662
or something like you open and, you know,

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:18.162
I was giving to this little cat
a little bit of those same foods --

00:15:18.186 --> 00:15:19.209
(Laughter)

00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:22.217
and then I gave them
the chicken and rice we made,

00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:24.186
and they went for the chicken and rice.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.567
(Laughter)

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.523
(Applause)

00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:29.278
They don't even eat that themselves.

00:15:29.302 --> 00:15:33.781
We can feed humanity
for a day or two or five,
