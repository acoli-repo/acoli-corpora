00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:35.707
that we were sending the message
that we are with you.

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.518
Give us time, we are trying to fix this.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.953

Fresh fruit began coming,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.622

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:58.043
(Applause)

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.097
We began feeding people in San Juan.
