00:12:56.999 --> 00:13:01.039
and then when you noticed,
they started coming to you to ask you.

00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:04.615
JA: We cannot be asking everything
from Red Cross or Salvation Army.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:08.701
But the idea is, I donated before
to those organizations,

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:10.679
and they are the big organizations,

00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:14.682
and maybe the problem is
that we're expecting too much from them.

00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:18.869
It's not like they didn't do
what they were supposed to do.

00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:23.052
It's that the perception
is that that's what they do.

00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:28.815
But all of a sudden, you cannot get into
a moment like this and wash your hands,

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:32.124
and you say somebody else
is going to be picking it up.
