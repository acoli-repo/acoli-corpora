because I think some folks
would be interested to hear.

00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:33.614
So as you said, you came the first time,

00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:35.940
got on the ground,

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.314
went to the government command center,

00:12:38.338 --> 00:12:40.361
started to have some meetings with people,

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.772
and they weren't very receptive.

00:12:43.703 --> 00:12:46.616
José Andrés: This is great.
This is how good my talk was.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.084

00:12:48.108 --> 00:12:51.124
It's the first talk with a follow-up
in the history of TED.

00:12:51.148 --> 00:12:53.109
I feel so good.

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.458
(Laughter)

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.975
NM: So tell us why,
what were some of the challenges,

00:12:56.999 --> 00:13:01.039
and then when you noticed,
they started coming to you to ask you.
