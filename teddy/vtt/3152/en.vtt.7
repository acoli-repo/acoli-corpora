00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:30.013
This is how we began our first delivery.

00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:33.935
The hospitals -- nobody was feeding
the nurses and the doctors,

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.846
and we began feeding our first project,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.418
Hospital Carolina.

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:41.257
All of a sudden, every single
hospital was calling us.

00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:46.695
"We need food so we can feed
our 24/7 employees

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.645
taking care of the sick
and the elderly and the people in need."

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:56.079
And then the place was too small.
We were receiving orders.

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.984
Every time we got one guest, one customer,

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:00.659
we never stopped serving them,
