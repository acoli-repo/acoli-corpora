00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:30.491
We were making close to 70,000 meals a day

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:32.172
from one location alone.

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:37.300
(Applause)

00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:40.685
Volunteers began showing up
by the hundreds.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:44.051
At one point, we got
more than 7,000 volunteers

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.519
that were at least one hour
or more with us,

00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:50.809
at any given moment,
more than 700 people at once.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.920
You saw that we began creating a movement,

00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:56.738
a movement that had a very simple idea
everybody could rally behind:

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:58.404
let's feed the hungry.

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:02.622
And we began making food
that people could recognize,
