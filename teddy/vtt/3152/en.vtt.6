00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.945
On a Monday, we did a thousand meals,
sancocho, an amazing stew

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.862
with corn and yucca and pork.

00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.571
By Sunday, we were doing 25,000.

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:09.211
By Sunday, we already
didn't only use the restaurant,

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:13.753
but we rented the parking lot
right across.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.897
We began bringing food trucks,

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:19.371
and a rice and chicken paella
operation, and refrigerators,

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:20.877
and volunteers began coming.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:24.453
Why? Because everybody wants
to find a place to help,

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:26.848
a place to do something.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:30.013
This is how we began our first delivery.
