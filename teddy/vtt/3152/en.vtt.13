WEBVTT

00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:31.720
Volunteers kept showing up.

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:35.910
We never had any system
to deliver the food, people would tell me.

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:37.561
Sure, we had the system.

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:41.950
The entire island of Puerto Rico
was the perfect delivery system.

00:06:41.974 --> 00:06:44.101
Anybody with a truck wanted to help.

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:48.494
Anybody going from A to B
was for us the way to be bringing hope

00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:51.097
and a plate and a whole meal to anybody.

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:54.883
We began finding amazing systems
to do these food trucks,

00:06:54.907 --> 00:06:56.613
10 amazing food trucks.

00:06:56.637 --> 00:07:00.884
We began learning not to use
the place that needed the food,
