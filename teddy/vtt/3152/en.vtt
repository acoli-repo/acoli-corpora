00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:03.818
All right, let's get ready
for the worst TED Talk ever.

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:08.087
(Laughter)

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:10.484
I mean it. We prepared 30 minutes ago.

00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:14.151
I want to have it clear --
I love to be here with you all,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.873
but I wanted to be here
not to tell my story

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:22.301
but to tell the story
of the amazing people of Puerto Rico

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.262
that came together
to feed the people of Puerto Rico.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.966
My name is José Andrés,
and you know I love to feed the few,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.199
but even more, I love to feed the many.
