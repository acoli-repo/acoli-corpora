and we believe that nothing is impossible,

00:11:32.453 --> 00:11:36.425
and we put our know-how
to the service of those in need.

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:39.973
I arrived to an island
trying to feed a few people,

00:11:39.997 --> 00:11:42.044
and I saw a big problem,

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:47.469
and all of a sudden, the people
of Puerto Rico saw the same problem as me,

00:11:47.493 --> 00:11:49.583
and only we did one thing:

00:11:49.607 --> 00:11:51.242

And so the people of Puerto Rico

00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:57.671
and the chefs of Puerto Rico,
in a moment of disrepair,

00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:59.139
began bringing hope,
