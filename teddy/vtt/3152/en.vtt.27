and you say somebody else
is going to be picking it up.

00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:37.854
We had a simple problem
that had a very simple solution.

00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:41.133
This was not a faraway country

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:42.822
or the Green Zone in Baghdad.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.339
This was American soil,

00:13:45.363 --> 00:13:47.958
a beautiful place called Puerto Rico,

00:13:47.982 --> 00:13:53.021
with hundreds, thousands of restaurants
and people willing to help,

00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:55.284
but all of a sudden, we had people hungry,

00:13:55.308 --> 00:13:59.558
and we didn't have a plan
how to feed them in the short term.
