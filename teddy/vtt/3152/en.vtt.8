00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:00.659
we never stopped serving them,

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:03.954
because we wanted to make sure
that we were able to be stabilizing

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.422
any place we were joining,

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.976
any city, any hospital, any elderly home.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.166
Every time we made contact with them,
we kept serving them food, day after day,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.523
so we needed to grow.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.586
We moved into the big coliseum.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.412
25,000 meals became 50,000 meals,

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.974
became, all of a sudden,
the biggest restaurant in the world.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:30.491
We were making close to 70,000 meals a day
