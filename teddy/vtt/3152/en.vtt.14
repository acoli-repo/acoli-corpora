00:06:56.637 --> 00:07:00.884
We began learning not to use
the place that needed the food,

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:02.161
but the number,

00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.661
the number of the apartment:

00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:09.085
Lolo, a 92-year-old veteran
that was surrounded by water.

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:12.412
We began giving not only hope to people,

00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:14.395
but knowing their names,

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.515
checking day after day,

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.512
making sure that those elderly people
will never, ever again feel alone

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:22.126
in a moment of disrepair.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.571
And we began going to the deeper areas,

00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:28.825
places that all of a sudden,
the bridges were broken,

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.850
but we had to go, because it was easy
to stay in San Juan.
