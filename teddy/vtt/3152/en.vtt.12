00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.097
We began feeding people in San Juan.

00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:05.701
Before you knew, we were feeding the 78
municipalities all across the island.

00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:09.272
We needed a plan. One kitchen alone
was not going to feed the island.

00:06:09.296 --> 00:06:14.516
I went to FEMA. They kicked me out
with eight armored guards and AK-47s.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.469
I told them, "I want 18 kitchens
around the island."

00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:22.848
Guess what? Three days ago,
we reached our 18th kitchen

00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:24.023
around Puerto Rico.

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:28.127
(Applause)

00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:29.897
People began being fed.

00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:31.720
Volunteers kept showing up.
