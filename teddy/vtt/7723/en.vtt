00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:02.516
Bruno Giussani: It's difficult
to think clearly

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:04.436
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:06.596
because wars, while they unfold,

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:08.956
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog.

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:11.076
Information is abundant:

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:12.556
the millions of refugees,

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:16.996
the shocking suffering
and the destruction, the politics.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.596
But sense is lacking.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:23.036
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:25.396
as we enter the third week of the war.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.796
We wonâ€™t talk about the events of the day

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:31.516
but try to project a longer arc,
a broader context.
