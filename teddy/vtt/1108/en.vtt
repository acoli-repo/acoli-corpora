00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Sometimes I go browsing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[through] a very old magazine.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I found this observation test

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
about the story of the ark.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the artist that drew this observation test

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
did some errors, had some mistakes --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there are more or less 12 mistakes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Some of them are very easy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There is a funnel, an aerial part,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Some of them are about the animals, the number.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But there is a much more fundamental mistake
