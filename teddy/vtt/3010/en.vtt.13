00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:30.414
It's just --

00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:32.812
PM: You have to give us
a minute to take that in.

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:35.392
(Laughter)

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:39.409
LC: When I heard this young lady
speak before I came out --

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:41.964
she was so beautiful,

00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:44.186
and I wished I could be like that,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.687
and my husband, poor darling --

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.735
I lost him after
we were married 70 years --

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.636
didn't agree on one thing,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.227
never did, nothing,

00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.672
but we got along together

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:57.228
because he learned to understand me,

00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.363
and that was just hard,

00:06:59.387 --> 00:07:01.411
because he was so different.
