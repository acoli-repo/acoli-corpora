00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:30.238
where they could come together,

00:11:30.262 --> 00:11:33.570
particularly if they were working
on civil rights,

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:34.864
human rights,

00:11:34.888 --> 00:11:37.054
working to change the laws.

00:11:37.078 --> 00:11:40.833
LC: Well, because once

00:11:40.857 --> 00:11:43.929
nobody ever, ever bothered you.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.221
The police would never come in

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:48.761
and bother our customers, never.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.496
So they felt safe to come there.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.687
They could eat, they could plan.

00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.417
All the Freedom Riders,

00:11:55.441 --> 00:11:58.806
that's where they planned
all their meetings.

00:11:59.148 --> 00:12:02.336
They would come and we would
serve them a bowl of gumbo
