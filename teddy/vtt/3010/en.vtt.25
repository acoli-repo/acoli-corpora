00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:30.540
PM: Could we send you a list
to invite to lunch?

00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:31.657
(Laughter)

00:12:31.681 --> 00:12:32.897
LC: Yeah, invite.

00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:35.070
Because that's what we're not doing.

00:12:35.094 --> 00:12:36.946
We're not talking.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.186
Come together.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.567
I don't care if you're a Republican
or what you are -- come together.

00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:42.781
Talk.

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:44.060
And I know those old guys.

00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:45.704
I was friends with those old guys,

00:12:45.728 --> 00:12:48.162
like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.

00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:51.233
They knew how to come together and talk,

00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:54.833
and you would disagree maybe.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.134
That's OK.

00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:59.138
But you would talk, and we would come
to a good thing and meet.

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:02.017
And so that's what we did
in that restaurant.
