00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:02.139
and I said, come on, pick up
your pants, and let's go to work,

00:17:02.163 --> 00:17:04.219
because you're going to get left behind.

00:17:04.243 --> 00:17:05.752
And that's what you have to do.

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:07.506
You have to move on people,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.268
move on what they do.

00:17:09.292 --> 00:17:12.707
It was going to bring
visibility to the city.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:16.648
So you got that visibility --
move on it, uplift yourself,

00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:18.306
do what you have to do,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.171
and do it well.

00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:21.437
And that's all we do.

00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:22.764
That's all I try to do.

00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:26.950
PM: But you just gave
the formula for resilience. Right?

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:32.352
So you are clearly the best example
we could find anywhere of resilience,
