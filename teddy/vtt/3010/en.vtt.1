I mean, you get this old
and parts start wearing out.

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:33.838
Your legs start wearing out.

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:36.719
The one thing that my children always say:

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:38.545
"But nothing happened to your mouth."

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.006
(Laughter)

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.126
So you've got to have something going,
so I've got my mouth going.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.896
(Laughter)

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.917
PM: So Mrs. Chase,
the first time we were there,

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:53.087
I brought a group of young women,
who work with us at TED,

00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:54.271
into the kitchen,

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:57.295
and we were all standing around
and you had already cooked lunch

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.389
for hundreds of people,
as you do every day,

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:01.326
and you looked up at them.
