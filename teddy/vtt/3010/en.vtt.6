You know, the Navy was the last thing
to really be integrated,

00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:08.542
and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:13.090
as a favor to an African-American man,

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:15.489
Lester Granger, that I knew very well.

00:03:15.513 --> 00:03:19.504
He was the head of the National
Urban League back there,

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:21.807
and when Roosevelt asked him,

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:27.086
he wanted to appoint Lester
as maybe one of his cabinet members.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.445
Lester said, "No, I don't want that.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.794
All I want you to do
is integrate that Navy."
