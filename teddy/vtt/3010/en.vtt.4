She raised 11 of us out of that 14,

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:06.021
and up until last year,
we were all still living,

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.294
a bunch of old biddies,
but we're still here.

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:09.644
(Laughter)

00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:13.899
And sometimes we can be just cantankerous
and blah blah blah blah blah,

00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:15.390
but we still go.

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:18.820
And I love to see women.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:20.956
You don't know what it does for me

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.448
to see women in the position
that you're in today.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.913
I never thought I'd see that.

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:29.278
I never thought I'd see women

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:34.596
be able to take places
and positions that we have today.
