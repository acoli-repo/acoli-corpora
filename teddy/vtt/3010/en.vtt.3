00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:32.075
And, well, we didn't have
the education you have today,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.725
and God, I'm so proud

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.138
when I see those women
with all that education under their belt.

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:39.475
That's why I worked hard,

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.451
tried to get everybody
to use those resources.

00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:47.328
So they just don't know their power,

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:51.002
and I always tell them,
just look at my mother,

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:53.471
had 12 girls before she had a boy.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.669
(Laughter)

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:56.161
So you know how I came out.

00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:57.407
(Laughter)

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.986
Now, she had 14 children.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.058
She raised 11 of us out of that 14,
