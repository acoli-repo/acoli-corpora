00:03:56.937 --> 00:04:00.105
"Well, you could get
into the space program."

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.304
She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old."

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:04.804
She was already 60-some years old,

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.828
and, you know, you're over the hill then.

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:10.201
(Laughter)

00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:13.686
They don't want you flying
up in the sky at 60-something years old.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.962
Stay on the ground.

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:18.312
When I meet women,

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:20.757
and today everybody comes to my kitchen,

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:22.280
and you know that,

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.511
and it upsets Stella, my daughter.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.811
She doesn't like people
coming in the kitchen.

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:28.297
But that's where I am,

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.162
and that's where you're going
to see me, in the kitchen.
