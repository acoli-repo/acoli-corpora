00:04:58.284 --> 00:05:00.721
And you know, my mother taught us ...

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:03.173
she was tough on us,

00:05:03.197 --> 00:05:04.880
and she said, "You know, Leah,"

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.309
she gave us all this plaque,

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:11.381
"to be a good woman,
you have to first look like a girl."

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:14.032
Well, I thought I looked like a girl.

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:15.577
"Act like a lady."

00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:17.168
That, I never learned to do.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.066
(Laughter)

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.051
"Think like a man."

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:23.648
Now don't act like that man;
think like a man.

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:25.128
And "work like a dog."

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.318
(Laughter)

00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:30.075
So we learned that the hard way.
