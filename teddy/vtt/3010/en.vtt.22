She liked to do things for you.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.929
She liked to give.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.044
So she would do that,

00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:05.453
and maybe that helped us out,

00:11:05.477 --> 00:11:07.793
because nobody ever bothered us.

00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:12.311
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith,

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:17.292
who started all kinds of things
right in that restaurant,

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.922
and nobody ever bothered us.

00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:20.956
So we just did it.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.131
PM: Excuse me.

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:24.238
You talked to me that day

00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:28.507
about the fact that people considered
the restaurant a safe haven

00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:30.238
where they could come together,
