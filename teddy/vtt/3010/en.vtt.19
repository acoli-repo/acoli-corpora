because he was sick,

00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:34.955
so she opened up
this little sandwich shop,

00:09:34.979 --> 00:09:37.875
so she was going to take down the numbers,

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.486
because he was sick a lot.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.371
He had ulcers. He was really bad
for a long a time.

00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:45.731
So she did that --

00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:48.549
and not knowing anything,

00:09:48.573 --> 00:09:50.477
but she knew she could make a sandwich.

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:51.946
She knew she could cook,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.779
and she borrowed 600 dollars
from a brewery.

00:09:56.274 --> 00:10:00.749
Can you imagine starting
a business today with 600 dollars
