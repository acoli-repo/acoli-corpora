00:07:57.045 --> 00:08:02.322
But still, my daddy insisted
that we act nice,

00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:03.762
we be kind.

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:05.024
And that's all.

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:06.614
When I heard this young woman --

00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:09.099
oh, she sounds so beautiful --

00:08:09.123 --> 00:08:11.901
I said, "I wish I could be like that."

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:15.134
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you
to be any different than you are.

00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:16.689
There is no question about that.

00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.337
Let me ask you.

00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:20.837
This is why it's so wonderful
to have a conversation

00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:22.941
with someone who has such a long view --

00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:24.116
LC: A long time.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.490
PM: to remembering Roosevelt

00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:27.318
and the person he did that favor for.

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:30.272
What is in your head and your mind
