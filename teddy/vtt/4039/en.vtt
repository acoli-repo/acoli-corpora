I want you to imagine

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
walking into a room,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.616
a control room with a bunch of people,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.480
a hundred people, hunched
over a desk with little dials,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.800
and that that control room

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.376
will shape the thoughts and feelings

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.640
of a billion people.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.440
This might sound like science fiction,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.536
but this actually exists

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.760
right now, today.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.400
I know because I used to be
in one of those control rooms.
