00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.320
is to know how someone's mind works.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.136
And there's a whole bunch
of persuasive techniques

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.656
that I learned in college at a lab
called the Persuasive Technology Lab

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.280
to get people's attention.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.360
A simple example is YouTube.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.936
YouTube wants to maximize
how much time you spend.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.160
And so what do they do?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.120
They autoplay the next video.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.576
And let's say that works really well.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.016
They're getting a little bit
more of people's time.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.416
Well, if you're Netflix,
you look at that and say,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.298
well, that's shrinking my market share,

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:30.322
so I'm going to autoplay the next episode.
