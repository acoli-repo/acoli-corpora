00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.416
about hypothetical future
runaway artificial intelligences

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.320
that are maximizing for one goal,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.336
we could solve the runaway
artificial intelligence

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.416
that already exists right now,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.360
which are these newsfeeds
maximizing for one thing.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.896
It's almost like instead of running away
to colonize new planets,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.976
we could fix the one
that we're already on.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.120
(Applause)

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.816
Solving this problem

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.640
is critical infrastructure
for solving every other problem.
