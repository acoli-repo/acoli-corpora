of who can go lower to get it.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.256
Let me give you an example of Snapchat.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.976
If you didn't know,
Snapchat is the number one way

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.256
that teenagers in
the United States communicate.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.456
So if you're like me, and you use
text messages to communicate,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.256
Snapchat is that for teenagers,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.976
and there's, like,
a hundred million of them that use it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.216
And they invented
a feature called Snapstreaks,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.136
which shows the number of days in a row

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.776
that two people have
communicated with each other.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.656
In other words, what they just did

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.640
is they gave two people
something they don't want to lose.
