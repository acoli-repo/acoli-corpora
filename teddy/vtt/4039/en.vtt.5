00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:30.322
so I'm going to autoplay the next episode.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.696
But then if you're Facebook,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.056
you say, that's shrinking
all of my market share,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.736
so now I have to autoplay
all the videos in the newsfeed

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.522
before waiting for you to click play.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.480
So the internet is not evolving at random.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.736
The reason it feels
like it's sucking us in the way it is

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.136
is because of this race for attention.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.576
We know where this is going.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120
Technology is not neutral,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.736
and it becomes this race
to the bottom of the brain stem

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.960
of who can go lower to get it.
