and the second would be empowering us
to live out the timeline that we want.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.640
So let me give you a concrete example.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.736
Today, let's say your friend
cancels dinner on you,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.535
and you are feeling a little bit lonely.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.376
And so what do you do in that moment?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.679

the designers in the control room

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.120
which is to maximize how much time
you spend on the screen.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.536
Now, instead, imagine if those designers
created a different timeline

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.056
that was the easiest way,
using all of their data,
