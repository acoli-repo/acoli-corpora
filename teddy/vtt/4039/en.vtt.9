00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.256
notice that that thought
just comes over you.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.600
Outrage is a really good way also
of getting your attention,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.456
because we don't choose outrage.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.896
It happens to us.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.776
And if you're the Facebook newsfeed,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.216
whether you'd want to or not,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.976
you actually benefit when there's outrage.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.936
Because outrage
doesn't just schedule a reaction

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.840
in emotional time, space, for you.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.856
We want to share that outrage
with other people.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.456
So we want to hit share and say,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.520
"Can you believe the thing
that they said?"
