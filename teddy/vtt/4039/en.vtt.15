00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.216
are accountable and transparent
to what we want.

The only form of ethical

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.896
is when the goals of the persuader

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.120
are aligned with the goals
of the persuadee.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.480
And that involves questioning big things,
like the business model of advertising.

we need a design renaissance,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.136
because once you have

who have some desire

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.776
about what they want to do
and what they want to be thinking

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.936
and what they want to be feeling
and how they want to be informed,
