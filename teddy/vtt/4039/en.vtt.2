If you see a notification,
it schedules you to have thoughts

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.720
that maybe you didn't intend to have.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.016
If you swipe over that notification,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.421
it schedules you into spending
a little bit of time

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:10.826
getting sucked into something

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.805
that maybe you didn't intend
to get sucked into.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.840
When we talk about technology,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.736
we tend to talk about it
as this blue sky opportunity.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.240
It could go any direction.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.256
And I want to get serious for a moment

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.960
and tell you why it's going
in a very specific direction.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.040
Because it's not evolving randomly.
