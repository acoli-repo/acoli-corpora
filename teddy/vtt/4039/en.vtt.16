00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.936
and what they want to be feeling
and how they want to be informed,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.496
and we're all just tugged
into these other directions.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.216
And you have a billion people just tugged
into all these different directions.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.296
Well, imagine an entire design renaissance

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.416
that tried to orchestrate
the exact and most empowering

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.576
time-well-spent way
for those timelines to happen.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.256
And that would involve two things:

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.416
one would be protecting
against the timelines

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.296
that we don't want to be experiencing,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.736
the thoughts that we
wouldn't want to be happening,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.096
so that when that ding happens,
not having the ding that sends us away;

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.736
and the second would be empowering us
to live out the timeline that we want.
