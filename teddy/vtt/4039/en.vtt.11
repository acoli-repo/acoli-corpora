00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.976
because of the business model
of advertising,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.336
for anybody who can pay the most
to actually walk into the control room

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.936
and say, "That group over there,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600
I want to schedule these thoughts
into their minds."

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.960
So you can target,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.976
you can precisely target a lie

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.920
directly to the people
who are most susceptible.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.960
And because this is profitable,
it's only going to get worse.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.840
So I'm here today

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
because the costs are so obvious.
