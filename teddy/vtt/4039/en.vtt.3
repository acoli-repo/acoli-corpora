00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.040
Because it's not evolving randomly.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.016
There's a hidden goal
driving the direction

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.176
of all of the technology we make,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.120
and that goal is the race
for our attention.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.576
Because every news site,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.336
TED, elections, politicians,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.336
games, even meditation apps

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.320
have to compete for one thing,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.896
which is our attention,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.520
and there's only so much of it.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.856
And the best way to get people's attention

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.320
is to know how someone's mind works.
