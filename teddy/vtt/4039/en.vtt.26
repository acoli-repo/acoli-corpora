Chris Anderson: Tristan, thank you.
Hey, stay up here a sec.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.056
First of all, thank you.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.856
I know we asked you to do this talk
on pretty short notice,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.096
and you've had quite a stressful week

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.560
getting this thing together, so thank you.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.656
Some people listening might say,
what you complain about is addiction,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.176
and all these people doing this stuff,
for them it's actually interesting.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.456
All these design decisions

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.576
have built user content
that is fantastically interesting.
