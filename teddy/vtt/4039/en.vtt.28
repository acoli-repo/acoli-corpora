You would want YouTube to know
something about, say, falling asleep.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.576
The CEO of Netflix recently said,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.336
"our biggest competitors
are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.816
And so what we need to recognize
is that the human architecture is limited

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.816
and that we have certain boundaries
or dimensions of our lives

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.816
that we want to be honored and respected,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.656
and technology could help do that.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.296
(Applause)

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.016
CA: I mean, could you make the case

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.096
that part of the problem here is that
we've got a naïve model of human nature?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.856
So much of this is justified
in terms of human preference,

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.496
where we've got these algorithms
that do an amazing job
