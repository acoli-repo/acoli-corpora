00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.976
In other words, it's scheduling
a little timeline of things

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.136
you're going to continue
to do on the screen.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.136
And imagine instead that there was
another button there saying,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.216
what would be most
time well spent for you?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.816
And you click "host a dinner."

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.936
And right there
underneath the item it said,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.656
"Who wants to RSVP for the dinner?"

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.936
And so you'd still have a conversation
about something controversial,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.696
but you'd be having it in the most
empowering place on your timeline,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.736
which would be at home that night
with a bunch of a friends over

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.960
to talk about it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.160
So imagine we're running, like,
a find and replace
