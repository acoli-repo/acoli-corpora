00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.496
where we've got these algorithms
that do an amazing job

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.216
of optimizing for human preference,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.576
but which preference?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.096
There's the preferences
of things that we really care about

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.496
when we think about them

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.576
versus the preferences
of what we just instinctively click on.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.256
If we could implant that more nuanced
view of human nature in every design,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.736
would that be a step forward?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.736
TH: Absolutely. I mean, I think right now

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.256
it's as if all of our technology
is basically only asking our lizard brain

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.776
what's the best way
to just impulsively get you to do

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.936
the next tiniest thing with your time,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.616
instead of asking you in your life
