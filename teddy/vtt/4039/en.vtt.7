is they gave two people
something they don't want to lose.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.456
Because if you're a teenager,
and you have 150 days in a row,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.456
you don't want that to go away.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640
And so think of the little blocks of time
that that schedules in kids' minds.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.496
This isn't theoretical:
when kids go on vacation,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.776
it's been shown they give their passwords
to up to five other friends

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.016
to keep their Snapstreaks going,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.056
even when they can't do it.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.016
And they have, like, 30 of these things,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.416
and so they have to get through
taking photos of just pictures or walls

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.920
or ceilings just to get through their day.
