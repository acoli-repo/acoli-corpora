and virtual reality
and these cool things that could happen,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.616
which are going to be susceptible
to the same race for attention,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.816
if we could fix the race for attention

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.560
on the thing that's already
in a billion people's pockets.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.616
Maybe instead of getting excited

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.816
about the most exciting
new cool fancy education apps,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.736
we could fix the way
kids' minds are getting manipulated

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.240
into sending empty messages
back and forth.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.336
(Applause)

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.616
Maybe instead of worrying

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.416
about hypothetical future
runaway artificial intelligences
