00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:03.227
So sometimes I get angry,

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:07.375
and it took me many years
to be able to say just those words.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.726
In my work,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.777
sometimes my body thrums, I'm so enraged.

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.658
But no matter how justified
my anger has been,

00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:19.810
throughout my life,

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.771
I've always been led to understand
that my anger is an exaggeration,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.699
a misrepresentation,

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:29.390
that it will make me rude and unlikable.
