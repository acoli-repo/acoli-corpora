00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:30.172
is more than a self-esteem boost.

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:34.714
It helps us figure out when we can forge
ahead on our own decisions and instincts

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:39.393
and when we need, instead, 
to seek out advice.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.705
But psychological research suggests
that we're not very good

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.664
at evaluating ourselves accurately.

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:50.001
In fact, we frequently overestimate
our own abilities.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.293
Researchers have a name 
for this phenomena,

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:55.626
the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.204
This effect explains 
why more than 100 studies

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.465
have shown that people display 
illusory superiority.
