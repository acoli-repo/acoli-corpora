00:03:56.432 --> 00:04:00.083
The result is that people, 
whether they're inept or highly skilled,

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:04.352
are often caught in a bubble
of inaccurate self-perception.

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:07.673
When they're unskilled, 
they can't see their own faults.

00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:09.461
When they're exceptionally competent,


00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:14.303
they don't perceive how unusual 
their abilities are.

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:18.493
So if the Dunning-Kruger effect 
is invisible to those experiencing it,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:24.873
what can you do to find out how good
you actually are at various things?

00:04:24.873 --> 00:04:27.524
First, ask for feedback from other people,


00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.584
and consider it, 
even if it's hard to hear.
