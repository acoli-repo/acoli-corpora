00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:00.637
and chess

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:08.238
all tend to rate their expertise almost
as favorably as actual experts do.

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:11.397
So who's most vulnerable to this delusion?

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:15.718
Sadly, all of us because we all have
pockets of incompetence

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.638
we don't recognize.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.820
But why?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.719
When psychologists Dunning and Kruger
first described the effect in 1999,

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.873
they argued that people lacking
knowledge and skill in particular areas

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.329
suffer a double curse.
