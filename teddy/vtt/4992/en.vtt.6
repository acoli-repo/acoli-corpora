the students simply couldn't recognize
when or how often

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.491
their arguments broke down.

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.440
The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question
of ego blinding us to our weaknesses.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.541

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:25.651
In one study, students who had initially
done badly on a logic quiz

and then took a mini course on logic

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.081
were quite willing to label
their original performances as awful.
