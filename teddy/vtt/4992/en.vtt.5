00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.329
suffer a double curse.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.148
First, they make mistakes
and reach poor decisions.

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:40.581
But second, those same knowledge gaps also
prevent them from catching their errors.

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.449
In other words, poor performers lack
the very expertise needed

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.419
to recognize how badly they're doing.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.419
For example, when the researchers studied

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.979
participants in 
a college debate tournament,

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.569
the bottom 25% of teams 
in preliminary rounds

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.623
lost nearly four 
out of every five matches.

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:03.229
But they thought they were winning
almost 60%.
