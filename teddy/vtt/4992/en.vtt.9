Second, and more important, keep learning.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:34.935
The more knowledgeable we become,

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:40.454
the less likely we are to have
invisible holes in our competence.

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.333
Perhaps it all boils down 
to that old proverb:

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.835
When arguing with a fool,

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:49.115
first make sure the other person
isn't doing the same thing.
