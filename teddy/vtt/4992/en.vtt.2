00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.465
have shown that people display 
illusory superiority.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:04.544
We judge ourselves as better than others

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:08.134
to a degree that violates 
the laws of math.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:12.665
When software engineers at two companies
were asked to rate their performance,

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:17.637
32% of the engineers at one company
and 42% at the other

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:21.224
put themselves in the top 5%.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:25.195
In another study, 88% of American drivers

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.465
described themselves 
as having above average driving skills.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.606
These aren't isolated findings.
