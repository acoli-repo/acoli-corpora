00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.121
By the end of the 20th century,

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:14.413
the race to build the world's tallest
skyscraper grinded to a halt.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.538
Each new contender was only slightly
taller than the one before,

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:23.079
and architects were running out of ways
to top their previous efforts.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.079
But in 2004 construction began
on a new building in Dubai,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.746
promising a revolutionary design 
that would dwarf the competition.
