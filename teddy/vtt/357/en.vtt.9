Basically classified adverts with a search facility.

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.324
So why do we have this disparity

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:38.874
between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy

00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:42.490
that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.939
out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.323
and what the rest of us have?

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:51.389
A modern market is more than a website;

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.008
it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,

00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:56.542
back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:01.439
settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.
