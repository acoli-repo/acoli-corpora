00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:32.939
whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.431
to fund the whole thing

00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:35.806
will get the deal.

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:37.606
So government then exits the frame.

00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:39.239
This is now in the hands of the consortium.

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.790
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.874
and make a percentage on all of it

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.473
or it's all going to crash and burn,

00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:47.090
which is tough on their shareholders.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.540
It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.190
And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.623
So this would just be one more choice

00:09:56.623 --> 00:09:59.439
among millions of Internet forums.

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:01.989
But it could be very different,
