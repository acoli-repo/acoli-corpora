00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:35.912
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:39.779
because national e-markets will deliver data.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.412
So this is a local person

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:45.412
potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:48.261
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training

00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:49.661
if they wanted to go into that market.

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.279
They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.779
who wanted a pool of babysitters.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.180
Is it worth their while?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.880
Should they be looking at other sectors?

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.764
Should they be moving to another part of the country

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:01.013
where there's a shortage of babysitters?
