00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:30.237
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:33.266
to find the work that they so often need very badly.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.085
Which is a tragedy because there are employers

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:39.391
who can use pools of very flexible local people

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:43.290
booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.891
Imagine that you run a cafe.

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:47.558
It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:49.141
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.458
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.112
to start in an hour's time,

00:00:55.112 --> 00:01:00.070
you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.
