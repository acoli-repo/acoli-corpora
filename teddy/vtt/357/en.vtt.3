00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:31.612
what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.729
They do exist. Here's how they work.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.196
So in this example, a distribution company has said,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:40.479
we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.879
Show us everyone who's available.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.530
It's found 31 workers.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.062
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:49.396
They're all contactable in time for this booking.

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:53.397
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:56.811
And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:59.372
And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.296
Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.
