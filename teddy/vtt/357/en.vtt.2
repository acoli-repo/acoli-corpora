you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.946
They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:05.113
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:09.045
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.428
so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.746
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:18.045
it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:22.578
There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:25.729
possibly already once they've been inducted.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.762
At this level of the labor market,

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:31.612
what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.
