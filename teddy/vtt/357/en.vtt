This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.

00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:07.535
It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:08.852
if they're to work at all.

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.019
So think, for instance,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.637
of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:16.420
or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.267
or a parent with complex child care needs.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.425
Their availability for work can be such that it's,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.118
"A few hours today.

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.718
Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:30.237
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people
