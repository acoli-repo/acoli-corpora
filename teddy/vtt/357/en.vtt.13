00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:47.123
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:49.305

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:53.156
woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create

I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.
