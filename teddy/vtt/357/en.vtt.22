00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:01.013
where there's a shortage of babysitters?

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:03.363
This kind of data can become routine.

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:05.397
And this data can be used by investors.

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:08.563
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country

00:11:08.563 --> 00:11:11.462
and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.046
an investor can pay for it

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:16.730
and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.379
for maybe the next two years.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:21.680
This is a world of atomized capitalism.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.712
So it's small trades by small people,

00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:30.579
but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.
