00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:00.856
this was an unqualified success.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.640
But let's suppose that our aim

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.523
is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.

00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:08.673
Could we use the same model?

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:10.457
I believe we could.

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:14.573
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.

00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:18.557
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:20.406
Think of it as a regulated public utility.

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:23.290
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.406
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.223
that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
