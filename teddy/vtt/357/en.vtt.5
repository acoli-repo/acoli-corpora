00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:30.896
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted

00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:33.178
are available each hour next week.

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.912
And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:38.529
But is there more that could be done

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.279
for this corner of the labor market?

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.965
Because right now there are so many people

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.563
who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:48.613
Let's make it personal.

00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:51.396
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.596
very little prospect of getting a job --

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:57.312
what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.596
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.896
in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.
