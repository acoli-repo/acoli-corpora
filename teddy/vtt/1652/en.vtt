00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on a collective level.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we're in denial about,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's like when you're mean to your wife

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because you're mad at somebody else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.
