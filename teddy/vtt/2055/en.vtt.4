00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now we have humans imitating robots.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that voice, without losing a beat, says,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
