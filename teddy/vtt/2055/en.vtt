00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
thank God for technology --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So these four characters are going to be from that work

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that I've been doing for many years now,
