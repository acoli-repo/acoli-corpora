00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
whose stores had been burned to the ground.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and questioning what justice is in society.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
