00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but there's something in him.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and steal them from the woman who owns them,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
he's going to do a terrible thing.'

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
