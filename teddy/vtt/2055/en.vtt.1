00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So these four characters are going to be from that work

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that I've been doing for many years now,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I've interviewed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I thought he would be the perfect person

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."
