00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
When I started this project

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
because my first big show was a show about a race riot.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And so I went to both -- two race riots,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Because this is what I would say

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
