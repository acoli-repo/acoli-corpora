Increasingly, they're even being barred

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:04.292
from setting foot
in places of potential refuge.

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:07.018
They're arrested or prosecuted,

00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:09.917
even deported before they ever
get to see an asylum officer.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.292
And even if they do
make it through the process,

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:17.309
asylum grant rates
can be as low as 20 percent

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.434
and far worse for some.

It's almost like the system was designed

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.208
to keep people
from exercising their right.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.309
But there is something
that many of these people can do.
