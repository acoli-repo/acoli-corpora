00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.018
I believe that by working
in effective partnerships

00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:07.101
with lawyers, doctors,
human rights advocates

00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:08.393
and many others,

00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:11.393
that we can work together
to meet these asylum seekers' needs,

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:13.393
that we can meet our historical,

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:14.684
humanitarian

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:16.583
and legal obligations to them.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.684
And when we do,

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:20.934
I think something powerful will unfold.

00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.809
Not only will these asylum seekers --

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:25.726
like the man who came to my clinic
and won his asylum case,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.268
like the children in the study

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:30.726
or the many thousands of others
seeking a new life,
