Several years ago a young man
came to see me in my clinic.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:08.000
He told me he was running for his life.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.476
He said that he fled his home,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.976
because there, homosexuality
wasn't just illegal,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.292
in some cases it was punishable by death.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.309
So when his sexual
orientation was exposed,

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.226
his family rejected him,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.101
his boss fired him

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.458
and angry mobs repeatedly
attacked him in the streets.

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.684
And each time the police
arrived only to arrest him,
