00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:04.643
the systematic and seemingly purposeful
endangerment of asylum seekers

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:08.393
and also the impunity
with which it's being done

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.667
has raised the harm
to an entirely new level.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.750
It reminds me of one
of the girls in the study

00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:19.976
who told us how she pleaded
with one of her attackers,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.268
asking him to stop,

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:22.708
asking why she was targeted.

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.958
And do you what his response was?

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:30.792
He says, "We can do this, because
there's no one here to protect you."
