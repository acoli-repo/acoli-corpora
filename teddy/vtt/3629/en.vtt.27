00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:30.518
and provide food, water,
shelter, clothing.

00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:32.809
And we'll certainly
meet them with medical care

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.458
and mental health care
that they so desperately need.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.434
When we say that we value the rule of law,

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:42.059
and not just the privileges
it provides a few

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:44.643
but the responsibilities
it requires of all of us,

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.643
we'll make sure that we have
a functioning immigration system.

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:49.809
We'll make sure that we have
trained judges.

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:54.268
We'll make sure that we're not
settling for the illusion of law and order

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:58.101
that maybe a tall wall
or a militarized border might provide us.

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.018
We want the real thing.
