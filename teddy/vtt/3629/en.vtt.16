they're gang members
trying to infiltrate our country.

To cut through some of this fog,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.226
my colleagues and I conducted a study.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.684
We looked at data

assault and torture.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.434
60 percent of the girls
and at least 10 percent of the boys
