00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.018
We want the real thing.

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:02.518
We want judges to be able
to evaluate the evidence,

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.101
including the medical evidence,

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:07.393
and we want them to administer justice ...

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:08.708
fairly.

00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:13.226
When we say that we value
health and well-being,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.417
that we don't want to perpetuate harm,

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:19.934
then we'll deploy
trauma-informed strategies

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.934
at all levels of the immigration system.

00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.434
It might start with retraining
border patrol agents

00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:26.059
or immigration officials,

00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:29.684
but it needs more medical,
mental health and child welfare experts

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.208
across the whole system.
