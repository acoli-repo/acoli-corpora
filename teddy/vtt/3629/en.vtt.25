00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.143
What about this one --

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.958
what does it mean when we say
we value law and order?

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:38.417
Does that also include respecting
due process rights for an asylum seeker?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.976
Now for some, when they hear these terms

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.018
they immediately gravitate
towards wanting to build more walls,

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:46.476
deploying more border patrol,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.976
deporting more people

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.018
even if it means separating
children from their families,

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:53.476
subjecting them to psychological torture

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.125
or deporting them to places
where they might die.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.601
All in the name of security.

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:00.917
All in our name.
