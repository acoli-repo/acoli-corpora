That was the physical and psychological
scars that he brought with him.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.458
You see, he suffered
from chronic, debilitating pain.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.434
He had severe scars
scattered over his body,

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.333
poorly healing wounds
that got infected over and over again.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.559
He suffered from severe depression

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:50.458
and continued to have regular, paralyzing
flashbacks and nightmares from PTSD.

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:54.101
So we continued our work.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.309
We met regularly for months,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.250
documenting each of these pieces
of medical evidence.
