00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.601
We went over the details of every attack,

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.018
photographed his scars,

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:06.434
documented his injuries and wounds,

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:10.893
and we were even able to start
chronicling his slow but steady recovery

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.208
while under our care.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.809
Working closely with his lawyers,

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:18.101
I submitted a detailed affidavit,

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.643
including the findings
of this forensic medical evaluation,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:24.768
and we included it as part
of his asylum application.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:26.768
And then we waited

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.167
for several long years
while he navigated the courts.
