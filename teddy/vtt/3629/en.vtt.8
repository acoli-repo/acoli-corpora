But the same can be true
for equal protection in the law --

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:02.726
due process.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.643
Especially in societies
for the most vulnerable,

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.976
the marginalized

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.684
and even those who are actively targeted,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.476
their access to these
human rights protections

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.184
that can mean the difference
between sickness and health,

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:19.167
and often it's the difference
between life and death.

And for millions of people
who endure persecution and torture,

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.851
the only way to heal

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:30.934
is to acknowledge the human rights
abuses that have occurred
