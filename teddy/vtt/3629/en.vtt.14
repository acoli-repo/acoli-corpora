they're growing increasingly desperate

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.292

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:06.559
Like over the past 10 years,

00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:08.500
the numbers of unaccompanied children

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.976
trying to seek safety
at our southwest border

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.101
has increased 18-fold,

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:18.167
from 3,300 in 2009
to over 62,000 this past year.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.333
That's in addition to nearly half
a million people traveling as families.

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:28.601
Men, women and children
trying to seek refuge at our borders,

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:31.625
but who are stranded
in a humanitarian crisis.
