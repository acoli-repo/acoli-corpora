00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.059
But like many people
fleeing this kind of persecution,

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.351
he couldn't carry much.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:04.851
He had some basic ID,

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.125
barely any money
and a few other belongings.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.018
He certainly didn't bring
official documents

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.309
from the police who tortured him.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.184
No videos from the mob
that tried to kill him.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.250
He didn't have this kind of evidence
to help support his claims,

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.893
yet here he was, sitting in my clinic,

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:26.292
showing me some of the most powerful
evidence of his persecution.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.292
That was the physical and psychological
scars that he brought with him.
