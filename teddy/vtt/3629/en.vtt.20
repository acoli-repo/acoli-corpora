Now despite this burden
and despite this trauma,

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:06.601
there are many others, still.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:10.809
Children who come to seek safety
and enter into our immigration system

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:12.351
only to find further abuse

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:15.125
and even torture reminiscent
of the places that they fled.

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:18.934
You might remember
some of those headlines,

00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.750
some of those images this past year.

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:25.309
Children being ripped
from the arms of their parents.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:29.268
Toddlers, infants
in cold and unsanitary cages.

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:32.375
The absence of food, water
clothing and even soap.
