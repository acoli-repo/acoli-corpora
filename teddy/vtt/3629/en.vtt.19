41 percent, depression

and 64 percent, PTSD.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.875
21 percent also had signs
of suicidality as children.

To put this into some perspective,
returning combat veterans,

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:51.292
they have PTSD on the order
of 10 to 20 percent.

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:55.351
These children at three to six times
more likely to have PTSD

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:57.625
than a soldier returning from war.
