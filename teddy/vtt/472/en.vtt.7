00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:30.934
and by tracking air quality around them,

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.809
cyclists, commuters, parents

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:36.101
will also contribute
to mapping air quality in their city.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.934
So we're building more than a device,

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.476
but a community.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.768
And last summer,

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:46.268
we sent early prototypes of our technology
to 100 volunteers in London,

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.268
and together they mapped air quality

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:52.018
across 1,000 miles of sidewalk

00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:54.309
and 20 percent of all of central London.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.018
So our goal now is to scale
this work around the world,

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.643
to crowdsource data so we can map
air quality on every street,
