also release harmful, local pollutants

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.268
that threaten our health
right here and right now.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.518
All this time I'd focused
on the long-term environmental risk

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.434
when I should have been up in arms

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:48.309
about the immediate health impact
of pollutants in the air.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.851
Air pollution is a burning

to the world economy

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:02.101
and, worst, it robs us
of our most precious gift,
