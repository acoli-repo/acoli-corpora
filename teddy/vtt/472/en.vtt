00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.559
So for the past 12 years,

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.184
I've been obsessed with this idea

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:08.183
that climate change
is an information issue

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.434
that computers will help us fight.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:13.101
I went from data science
to climate policy research,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.518
from tech to public service,

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.476
in pursuit of better data

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.601
to avoid the wasted energy,
resources, opportunities

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.625
that lead to runaway carbon emissions.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.583
Until one day, running in the streets
with a friend, it hit me:

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.851
the same cars, factories, power plants

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.976
whose emissions are wrecking
our climate over time
