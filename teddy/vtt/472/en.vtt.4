So to governments,
air pollution looks like this.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:03.184
But for the rest of us,

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:05.809

if it was designed
for the age of the smartphone?

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:26.976
So for the past three years,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.559
my team and I have been
