00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.143
We must reach the same tipping point
for air quality and I believe we will.

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.934
In the past couple years alone,

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.601
governments have fined
carmakers record amounts

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.351
for cheating on emission standards.

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.893
Cities have passed congestion charges
or built bike lanes --

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:43.601
like Paris that turned this highway,

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.934
right next to my home,
in the middle of the city,

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.726
into a waterfront park.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.434
And now mayors around the world
are thinking of banning diesel outright

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.500
by 2025, 2030, 2035.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.833
But how much faster could we go,
how many lives could we save?
