00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.851
And that's because the way
we monitor air quality today

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:35.851
is designed not to help people breathe
but to help governments govern.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.059
Most major cities operate networks
of air-quality monitoring stations

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:41.351
like this one in London,

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.643
to decide when to cut traffic
or when to shut down factories.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.684
And these machines
are like the computers from the '60s

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.018
that filled entire rooms.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:53.226
They're incredibly precise
but incredibly large,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.934
heavy, costly --

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.726
so much that you can only deploy
just a few of them,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.226
and they cannot move.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.684
So to governments,
air pollution looks like this.
