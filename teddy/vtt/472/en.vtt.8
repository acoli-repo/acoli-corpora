00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.643
to crowdsource data so we can map
air quality on every street,

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.809
to build an unprecedented database

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.226
so scientists can research pollution,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.434
and to empower citizens,
civic leaders, policy makers

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.000
to support clean-air policies for change.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.851
Because this can and must change.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.142
Remember cigarettes in bars?

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:23.601
It took decades of lung cancer research
and second-hand smoking studies,

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:27.309
but eventually, we reached a tipping point
and we passed smoking-ban laws.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.143
We must reach the same tipping point
for air quality and I believe we will.
