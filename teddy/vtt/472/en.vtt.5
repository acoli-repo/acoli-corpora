00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.559
my team and I have been
building a technology

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.309
that helps you know what you breathe

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:33.792
and fits in your hand.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.726
Flow is a personal air-quality tracker
that you can wear with you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.559
on a backpack, a bike, a stroller.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.601
It's packed with miniature sensors

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:46.684
that monitor the most important
pollutants in the air around you,

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.393
like nitrogen oxides,

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:49.768
the exhaust gas from cars,

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.601
or particulate matter
that gets into your bloodstream

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.559
and creates strokes and heart issues.

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:57.101
Or volatile organic compounds,

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.434
the thousands of chemicals
in everyday products

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.059
that we end up breathing.
