00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.823
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:34.265
(Laughter)

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.012
I own a small business --

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.560
Rco Tires in Compton.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:40.547
A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:43.489
and he wrote, "Let's make
green collar jobs in the hood,"

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.557
I took him really seriously.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:49.788
So I cofounded, own and operate
a tire recycling company,

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:51.774
and I'm really proud of what we've done.

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:55.171
So far, we've recycled
a hundred million pounds of rubber.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:59.607
That's 21 million gallons of oil
diverted from landfills

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.795
into new products.
