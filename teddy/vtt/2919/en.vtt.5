00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:31.199
which again, would have never been
given to a black man

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:33.609
before the anti-discrimination
act of the 1960s.

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:35.906
So, you fast-forward 30 years,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.318
and I graduate,

00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:39.044
and I want to start my own business

00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:40.945
with a pile of debt and a credit card,

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.312
and no experience in the tire industry.

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:45.573
But I had what most people didn't have.

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:50.076
I had a clean, safe, free place to live.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.784
I moved in with my grandmother,

00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:55.133
and I was able to rent
our first warehouse,

00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:56.333
buy our first truck,

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:57.917
pay our first employees,

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.355
because I didn't have to worry
about paying myself,
