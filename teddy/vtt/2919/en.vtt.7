00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.630
to build the types
of businesses that we want?

00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:34.202
And in telling a story
of the white side of my family,

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.377
I needed a dozen ways

00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:37.462
where blacks were excluded
from the economy,

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:41.034
whereas the white side of my family
was able to gain access and traction,

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:42.454
and build wealth ...

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:47.834
Primarily because racism
and capitalism are best homies, but --

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:49.660
(Laughter)

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.137
but what that means
is that when we ask ourselves,

00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:54.622
"Why are our communities broke?" --

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.852
Like, we're not just broke
because we're broke;

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.211
we're broke for a reason.

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.351
Historical context really does matter.
