00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.380
Are you tired of your boss?

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:04.429
(Laughter)

00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:06.294
Are you tired of going to work

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.751
and making money for other people?

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.541
And who are those people anyways?

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.644
Those people that make
money from your work.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:16.276
Well, they're capitalists.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.576
They have capital,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.267
and they use your labor
to make more capital.

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:23.047
So if you're tired of going to work

00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.276
and making money for other people,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.968
then you're probably like me --

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.759
just tired of capitalism.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.823
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.
