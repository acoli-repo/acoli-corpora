00:04:59.117 --> 00:05:01.360
because it answers
the question I asked earlier,

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.688
which was where are we going
to get the wealth

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:05.788

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:25.446
You may have heard of Black Wall Street

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.661

00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:29.731
