Historical context really does matter.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.861
But our history
tells another story as well.

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:06.573
There's this incredible book
called "Collective Courage,"

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:09.813
which is the story of how
thousands of African Americans

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:12.357
have been able to build
businesses and schools,

00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.624
hospitals, farming cooperatives,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:16.365
banks, financial institutions --

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.001
entire communities
and sovereign economies,

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.447
without a lot of capital.

00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:22.954
And they did it by working together

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:25.385
and leveraging their community assets

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.861
and trusting each other

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:28.585
and putting solidarity first --

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:31.408
not just profits by any means necessary.
