00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:31.223
because it really represents
an alternative

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:33.278
to the type of economy we have now,

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:34.664
which exploits all of us.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.970
It also represents an alternative

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:40.954
to waiting around for big investors
to bring chain stores,

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.750
or big-box stores to our communities,

00:06:42.774 --> 00:06:45.050
because honestly,
those types of developments,

00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:47.398
they steal resources from our communities.

00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:50.259
They put our mom-and-pop shops
out of business,

00:06:50.283 --> 00:06:53.379
they make our entrepreneurs
into wage workers,

00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:55.209
and they take money out of our pocket

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:56.974
and send it to their shareholders.

00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:01.431
So, I was so inspired by all these stories
of resistance and resilience
