not just profits by any means necessary.

00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:35.693

going to finance black liberation.

00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:56.970
So, there are so many great
examples in this book,

00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:59.093
and I suggest that everybody just read it

00:04:59.117 --> 00:05:01.360
because it answers
the question I asked earlier,
