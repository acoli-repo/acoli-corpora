00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.272
Right now, today, in South Bronx,

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:35.493
is the country's largest
worker-owned company.

00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:38.186
It's called Cooperative
Home Care Associates,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.170
and it was founded by black
and Latinx home care workers

00:05:41.194 --> 00:05:44.267
who are now able
to pay themselves living wages,

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.546
they have full-time hours,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.198
they have benefits and a pension,

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.800
through their membership
as a unit of SEIU.

00:05:50.778 --> 00:05:54.626
And these women owners now receive
a dividend back on their ownership

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.943
every year that the company
has been profitable,

00:05:56.967 --> 00:05:58.347
which has been most years.

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.910
So they're able to really enjoy
the fruits of their labor
