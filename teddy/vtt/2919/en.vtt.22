00:10:58.478 --> 00:11:02.098
in order to build the more just
and sustainable and resilient economy

00:11:02.122 --> 00:11:05.053
that we want for ourselves
and our children.

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.088
And with that,

00:11:07.112 --> 00:11:10.303

with a quote from Arundhati Roy,

00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:11.477

00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:26.096
With our art,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.294
our literature,

00:11:27.318 --> 00:11:28.582
our music,

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:29.756
our brilliance,
