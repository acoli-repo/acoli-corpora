And he held various union oil jobs --

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.207
jobs which would have never been given
to my black great-grandfather,

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.761
had he lived here at the time.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.671
Granny became a hairdresser

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.600
and then got a loan with her husband

00:02:13.624 --> 00:02:15.694
who built their home
in West Los Angeles --

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.196
a loan which would never have been
given to a black family at the time.

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.257
And after my grandfather passed away,

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.060
my granny was able to keep that house

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:26.761
because she had his pension
and his health care

00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:28.553
from a state job which he held,

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:31.199
which again, would have never been
given to a black man
