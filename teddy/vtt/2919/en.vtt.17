00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:31.757
These are the types of folks that want
more union businesses to exist,

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.991
so let's build them with them.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:36.510
Learning from our unions,

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.685
learning from our past,

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:38.882
learning from our peers,

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:41.550
are all going to be very
important to our success,

00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:44.478
which is why I'd like to leave you
with one last example

00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.526
and a vision for the future ...

00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:49.981
and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.

00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:55.191
Mondragon, Spain is a community
built entirely around worker cooperatives.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.662
There's 260-plus businesses here,

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:03.463
manufacturing everything from bicycles
to washing machines to transformers.
