00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:01.431
So, I was so inspired by all these stories
of resistance and resilience

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:04.223
that I got together with a few people
here in Los Angeles,

00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:05.627
and we created LUCI.

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:10.170
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles
Union Cooperative Initiative,

00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:13.290
and our objective is to create
more worker-owned businesses

00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:14.980
here in Los Angeles.

00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:17.362
So far, in the last year,
we've created two:

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:19.379
Pacific Electric, an electrical company,

00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:20.958
and Vermont Gage Carwash,

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.745
which is right here in South-Central,

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:24.801
some of you guys
might be familiar with it.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:29.496
This long-time carwash is now owned
and operated by its 20 workers,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.544
all of whom are union members as well.
