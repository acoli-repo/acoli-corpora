00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.795
into new products.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.385
(Cheers)

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.058
We also employ about 15 guys --

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.197
mostly people of color,

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:07.591
most of whom are felons,

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:09.490
and we pay above the minimum wage,

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.456
and we are now proud members
of the United Steelworkers Union.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:18.507
(Applause)

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:21.070
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.761
It's a privately held company
with community-minded ownership,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.539
but I would like it to become one.

00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:28.858
I would like for them to fire the boss --

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.221
that's me.
