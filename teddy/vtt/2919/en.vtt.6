00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.355
because I didn't have to worry
about paying myself,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.162
because I didn't need to feed myself,

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:05.727
because I am the direct beneficiary
of generations of white privilege.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:10.767
Now, telling the story
of white privilege is important

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.220
because very often people say,

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:14.102
"Oh, we want more companies like yours.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.284
We want more Rco's,

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:17.157
we want more black-owned businesses,

00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:19.845
female-led, triple bottom line,

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.041
Ban the Box,

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.027
green manufacturing companies," right?

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.382
But the question we have to ask is,
where is the wealth?

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.557
Where is the money?

00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:29.447
Where's the capital in our communities

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.630
to build the types
of businesses that we want?
