00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:10.288
Towering 85 meters above the Norwegian
countryside,

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:13.621
Mjøstårnet cuts a sleek shape 
in the rural skyline.

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.496
Housing 18 stories of restaurants,
apartments, and hotel rooms,

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.954
this modern building might
seem out of place.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:23.371
But a deeper look reveals it actually
blends in quite well

00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.038
among the forested farmlands.

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:29.788
This is likely because Mjøstårnet 
is the world’s tallest wooden building,

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:32.954
made almost entirely from the trees
of neighboring forests.
