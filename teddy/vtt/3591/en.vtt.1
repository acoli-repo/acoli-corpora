00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.448
That's actually an interesting
mathematical question.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:37.045
Is it possible to write a piece of music
that has no repetition whatsoever?

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.783
It's not random -- random is easy.

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:41.454
Repetition-free, it turns
out, is extremely difficult,

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.670
and the only reason
that we can actually do it

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:47.138
is because of a man
who was hunting for submarines.

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:51.372
It turns out, a guy who was trying
to develop the world's perfect sonar ping

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.362
solved the problem of writing
pattern-free music.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.585
And that's what the topic
of the talk is today.
