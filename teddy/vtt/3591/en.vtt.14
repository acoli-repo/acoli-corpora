00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:00.008
we were able to actually compose
this, or construct this,

00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:02.630
using multiplication by the number three.

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.054
The point when you hear this music

00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:07.536
is not that it's supposed to be beautiful.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.492
This is supposed to be
the world's ugliest piece of music.

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:15.306
In fact, it's music
that only a mathematician could write.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.353
(Laughter)

00:07:16.377 --> 00:07:19.200
When you're listening to this
piece of music, I implore you:

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:20.907
try and find some repetition.

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.397
Try and find something that you enjoy,

00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:26.407
and then revel in the fact
that you won't find it.

00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:27.773
(Laughter)

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.408
So without further ado, Michael Linville,
