00:03:28.983 --> 00:03:31.061
And shortly before the duel occurred,

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.143
he wrote down all
of his mathematical ideas,

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.098
sent letters to all of his friends,
saying "Please, please" --

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:37.327
this was 200 years ago --

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.549
"Please, please, see that these things
get published eventually."

00:03:40.573 --> 00:03:43.714
He then fought the duel,
was shot and died at age 20.

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:46.999
The mathematics that runs
your cell phones, the internet,

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:50.465
that allows us to communicate, DVDs,

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.317
all comes from the mind
of Évariste Galois,

00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:56.068
a mathematician who died 20 years young.

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.455
When you talk about
the legacy that you leave ...

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.551
Of course, he couldn't have
even anticipated
