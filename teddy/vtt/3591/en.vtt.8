00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.551
Of course, he couldn't have
even anticipated

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.656
the way that his mathematics
would be used.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.205
Thankfully, his mathematics
was eventually published.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.830
Solomon Golomb realized that that was
exactly the mathematics needed

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:12.242
to solve the problem of creating
a pattern-free structure.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.985
So he sent a letter back to John saying,

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.513
"It turns out you can generate
these patterns using prime number theory."

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:23.768
And John went about and solved
the sonar problem for the Navy.

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:26.747
So what do these patterns look like again?

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.953
Here's a pattern here.

00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:32.315
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array.
