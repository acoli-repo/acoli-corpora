00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.102
Today, we're going to hear the world
premiere of the perfect ping.

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:36.103
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array,

00:06:36.127 --> 00:06:37.722
mapped to notes on the piano,

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:41.219
played using a structure called
a Golomb ruler for the rhythm,

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.768
which means the starting
time of each pair of notes

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:45.365
is distinct as well.

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.098
This is mathematically almost impossible.

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:50.933
Actually, computationally,
it would be impossible to create.

00:06:50.957 --> 00:06:54.388
Because of the mathematics
that was developed 200 years ago,

00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:57.074
through another mathematician
recently and an engineer,

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:00.008
we were able to actually compose
this, or construct this,
