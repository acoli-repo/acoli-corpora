00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.280
There happen to be 88 notes on the piano.

00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:03.973
So today, we are going to have
the world premiere

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:08.088
of the world's first
pattern-free piano sonata.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:11.988
So, back to the question of music:

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.480
What makes music beautiful?

00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:16.536
Let's think about one of the most
beautiful pieces ever written,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.183
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
and the famous "da na na na!" motif.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:24.674
That motif occurs hundreds
of times in the symphony --

00:05:24.698 --> 00:05:26.846
hundreds of times
in the first movement alone

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.967
and also in all the other
movements as well.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:33.222
So the setting up of this repetition
is so important for beauty.
