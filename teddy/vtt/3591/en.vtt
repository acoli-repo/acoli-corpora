00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.801
So what makes a piece of music beautiful?

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:05.719
Well, most musicologists would argue

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:08.312
that repetition is a key aspect of beauty,

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.345
the idea that we take a melody,
a motif, a musical idea,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.632
we repeat it, we set up
the expectation for repetition,

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:17.503
and then we either realize it
or we break the repetition.

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:19.614
And that's a key component of beauty.

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:23.142
So if repetition and patterns
are key to beauty,

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.578
then what would the absence
of patterns sound like,

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.999
if we wrote a piece of music
that had no repetition whatsoever in it?
