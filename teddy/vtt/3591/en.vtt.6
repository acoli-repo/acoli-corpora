So, Solomon Golomb spent the summer
thinking about the problem.

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:06.147
And he relied on the mathematics
of this gentleman here,

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:07.345
Évariste Galois.

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.428
Now, Galois is a very
famous mathematician.

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.585
He's famous because he invented
a whole branch of mathematics

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.156
which bears his name,
called Galois field theory.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.468
It's the mathematics of prime numbers.

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:21.625
He's also famous
because of the way that he died.

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.281
The story is that he stood up
for the honor of a young woman.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.093
He was challenged to a duel,
and he accepted.

00:03:28.983 --> 00:03:31.061
And shortly before the duel occurred,
