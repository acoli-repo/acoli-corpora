This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array.

00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:34.981
It's generated in a very simple way.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:39.208
Elementary school mathematics
is sufficient to solve this problem.

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.855
It's generated by repeatedly
multiplying by the number three:

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.876
1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ...

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.380
When I get to a number that's larger
than 89 which happens to be prime,

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:54.257
I keep taking 89s away
until I get back below.

00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.123
And this will eventually fill
the entire grid, 88 by 88.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.280
There happen to be 88 notes on the piano.
