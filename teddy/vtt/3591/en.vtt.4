00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.488
These look like a random pattern
of dots, but they're not.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:03.814
If you look very carefully,

00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:07.633
you may notice that, in fact,
the relationship between each pair of dots

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:08.825
is distinct.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.349
Nothing is ever repeated.

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:13.070
The first two notes
and every other pair of notes

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:14.721
have a different relationship.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.296
So the fact that we know
about these patterns is unusual.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.511
John Costas is the inventor
of these patterns.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.107
This is a picture from 2006,
shortly before his death.

00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.040
He was the sonar engineer
working for the Navy.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.456
He was thinking about these patterns,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.339
and he was, by hand, able to come
up with them to size 12 --
