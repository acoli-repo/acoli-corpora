00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.339
and he was, by hand, able to come
up with them to size 12 --

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:33.655
12 by 12.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.600
He couldn't go any further
and thought maybe they don't exist

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:37.938
in any size bigger than 12.

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:40.585
So he wrote a letter
to the mathematician in the middle,

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.680
a young mathematician in California
at the time, Solomon Golomb.

00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:45.259
It turns out that Solomon Golomb

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:49.206
was one of the most gifted discrete
mathematicians of our time.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.307
John asked Solomon if he could tell him
the right reference

00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:53.856
to where these patterns were.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.041
There was no reference.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.441
Nobody had ever thought
about a repetition,

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.286
a pattern-free structure before.

00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.993
So, Solomon Golomb spent the summer
thinking about the problem.
