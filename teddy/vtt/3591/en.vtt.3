00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:30.079
was working on the Navy's extremely
expensive sonar system.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:33.765
It wasn't working, because the ping
they were using was inappropriate.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.095
It was a ping much
like the following here.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.188
You can think of this as the notes
and this is time.

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:42.374
(Piano notes play high to low)

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.612
So that was the sonar ping
they were using, a down chirp.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.481
It turns out that's a really bad ping.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.447
Why? Because it looks
like shifts of itself.

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:54.334
The relationship between the first
two notes is the same as the second two,

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:55.523
and so forth.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:58.031
So he designed a different
kind of sonar ping,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:01:59.513
one that looks random.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.488
These look like a random pattern
of dots, but they're not.
