It turns out that musicologists --

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.195
a famous composer by the name
of Arnold Schoenberg --

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.543
thought of this in the 1930s,
'40s and '50s.

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:09.699
His goal as a composer was to write music

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:12.280
that would free music
from tonal structure.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.659
He called it the "emancipation
of the dissonance."

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:16.882
He created these structures
called "tone rows."

00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.140
This is a tone row there.

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.064
It sounds a lot like a Costas array.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.720
Unfortunately, he died 10 years
before Costas solved the problem

00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.304
of how you can mathematically
create these structures.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.102
Today, we're going to hear the world
premiere of the perfect ping.
