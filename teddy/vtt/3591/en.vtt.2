00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:02.865
So, recall that in sonar,

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.766
you have a ship that sends
out some sound in the water,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.613
and it listens for it -- an echo.

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:10.646
The sound goes down, it echoes
back, it goes down, echoes back.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.039
The time it takes the sound to come back
tells you how far away it is:

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:15.505
if it comes at a higher pitch,

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.607
it's because the thing
is moving toward you;

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.569
if it comes back at a lower pitch,
it's moving away from you.

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.714
So how would you design
a perfect sonar ping?

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:26.219
Well, in the 1960s, a guy
by the name of John Costas

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:30.079
was working on the Navy's extremely
expensive sonar system.
