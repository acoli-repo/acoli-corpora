00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me talk about India

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
through the evolution of ideas.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because in every society, especially an open democratic society,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's only when ideas take root that things change.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Slowly ideas lead to ideology,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
lead to policies that lead to actions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.
