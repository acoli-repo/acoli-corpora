00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.206
This is it.

00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:05.209
Here we all are, together at last,

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:06.753
to talk about optimism.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.839
If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.425
Here's the problem: it's 2021.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.386
We are living through a global plague,

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:18.848
one that revealed our worst instincts
at the worst times.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.477
We are so divided that public health
has become a power struggle.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.814
We pioneered a vaccine,
a moon-landing level innovation,

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:30.276
and then kept it among wealthy countries
while poor ones suffered.
