00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:30.832
that a basic knowledge
of organic chemistry is valuable,

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:35.468
and I think that it can be made
accessible to everybody,

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:37.905
and I'd like to prove that to you today.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.310
Would you let me try?

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.862
Audience: Yeah!

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:43.949
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.

00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:45.227
(Laughter)

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:48.044
Here I have one of these
overpriced EpiPens.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.821
Inside it is a drug called epinephrine.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.384
Epinephrine can restart
the beat of my heart,

00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:56.973
or it could stop a life-threatening
allergic reaction.

00:01:56.997 --> 00:02:00.361
An injection of this
right here will do it.
