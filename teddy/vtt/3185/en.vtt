I'd like you to ask yourself,

00:00:02.973 --> 00:00:06.762
what do you feel when you hear
the words "organic chemistry?"

00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:07.952
What comes to mind?

00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:12.406
There is a course offered
at nearly every university,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.319
and it's called Organic Chemistry,

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.112
and it is a grueling, heavy
introduction to the subject,

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:21.226
a flood of content
that overwhelms students,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.440
and you have to ace it if you want
to become a doctor or a dentist

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:26.826
or a veterinarian.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.786
And that is why so many students
perceive this science like this ...
