00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.786
And that is why so many students
perceive this science like this ...

00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:34.097
as an obstacle in their path,

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.285
and they fear it and they hate it

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.452
and they call it a weed-out course.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.301
What a cruel thing for a subject
to do to young people,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.514
weed them out.

00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:47.318
And this perception spread
beyond college campuses long ago.

00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:51.014
There is a universal anxiety
about these two words.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:55.389
I happen to love this science,

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.913
and I think this position
in which we have placed it

00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:59.678
is inexcusable.

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:03.563
It's not good for science,
and it's not good for society,
