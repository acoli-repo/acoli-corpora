00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.379
Soon, I started making a forest

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.843
in the backyard of my own house,

00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:36.776
and this is how it looks after three years.

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:37.910
These forests,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.960
compared to a conventional plantation,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.382
grow 10 times faster,

00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:44.969
they're 30 times more dense,

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.940
and 100 times more biodiverse.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.800
Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.744
I could observe that the groundwater

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:55.623
didn't dry during summers,

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:58.480
the number of bird species I spotted in this area

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.650
doubled.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.026
Quality of air became better,
