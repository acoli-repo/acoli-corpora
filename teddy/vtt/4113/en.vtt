00:00:00.895 --> 00:00:02.631
I'm an industrial engineer.

00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:05.428
The goal in my life has always been to make

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:06.900
more and more products

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.410
in the least amount of time and resources.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.910
While working at Toyota,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.875
all I knew was how to make cars

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:15.328
until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:18.511
who came to our factory to make a forest in it

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:21.346
in order to make it carbon-neutral.

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.220
I was so fascinated

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.666
that I decided to learn this methodology

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.557
by joining his team as a volunteer.

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.379
Soon, I started making a forest
