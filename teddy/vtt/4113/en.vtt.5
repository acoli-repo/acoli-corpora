00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:30.437
mixed with rice straw,

00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:34.040
powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.321
is finally dumped in soil on which

00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:37.658
our forest is planted.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.887
Once planted, we use grass or rice straw

00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:42.619
to cover the soil

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.173
so that all the water which goes into irrigation

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:47.866
doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.796
And using these simple improvisations,

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.495
today we can make a forest

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:55.361
for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:57.814
Today, we are making forests in houses,

00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:01.882
in schools, even in factories with the corporates.
