00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.026
Quality of air became better,

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:03.587
and we started harvesting seasonal fruits

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.319
growing effortlessly

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.930
right in the backyard of our house.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.247
I wanted to make more of these forests.

00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:11.665
I was so moved by these results

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.689
that I wanted to make these forests

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.479
with the same acumen with which we make cars

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.899
or write software or do any mainstream business,

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.743
so I founded a company

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:23.590
which is an end-to-end service provider

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.935
to create these native natural forests.

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:30.130
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business
