00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.218
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:03.967
They are so dense

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:07.516
that one can't even walk into them.

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:10.750
For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.204
in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:19.284
In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.279
we started utilizing local biomass

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.046
as soil amender and fertilizers.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.814
For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:30.437
mixed with rice straw,
