00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:30.130
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.289
or an industry, we had to standardize

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.202
the process of forest-making.

00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:36.902
So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System

00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:39.916
known for its quality and efficiency

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:41.849
for the process of forest-making.

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.411
For an example, the core of TPS,

00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:47.751
Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.341
which is making manufacturing

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.790
of different models of cars

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.881
on a single assembly line.

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.727
We replaced these cars with trees,

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:59.650
using which now we can make multi-layered forests.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.218
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.
