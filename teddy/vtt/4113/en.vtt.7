00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.778
of their place.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.596
By installing a small hardware probe on site,

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:38.296
we can do remote soil testing,

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:42.101
using which we can give step-by-step instructions

00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.005
on forest-making remotely.

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.917
Also we can monitor the growth of this forest

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.566
without being on site.

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.117
This methodology, I believe,

00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:54.862
has a potential.

00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:57.695
By sharing, we can actually
bring back our native forests.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.342
Now, when you go back home,

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:01.045
if you see a barren piece of land,
