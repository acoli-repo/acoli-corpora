00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:01.882
in schools, even in factories with the corporates.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.860
But that's not enough.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.812
There is a huge number of people

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:08.681
who want to take matters into their own hands.

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.545
So we let it happen.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:14.785
Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:17.362
where we are going to share our methodology

00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:19.319
on an open source

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.770
using which anyone and everyone

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.280
can make their own forest

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.802
without our physical presence being there,

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.755
using our methodology.

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:28.010
At the click of a button,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.560
they can get to know all the native species

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.778
of their place.
