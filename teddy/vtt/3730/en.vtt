00:00:00.846 --> 00:00:03.984
We are witness to monumental
human progress.

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:07.885
Over the past few decades,
the expansion of the global marketplace

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:12.690
has lifted a third of the world's
population out of extreme poverty.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:15.693
Yet we are also witness
to an astounding failure.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:17.988
Our efforts to lift people up

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:21.474
have left behind those
in the harshest forms of poverty,

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:23.019
the ultra-poor.

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:27.164
What it means to be ultra-poor
goes beyond the monetary definition

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:29.042
that we're all familiar with:

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.236
living on less than two dollars a day.
