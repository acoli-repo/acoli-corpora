00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.753
with BRAC teams on-site
and embedded in each country.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.814
In July of 2019, my father was diagnosed
with terminal brain cancer

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:09.722
and given four months to live.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.534
As he transitioned out of BRAC after
leading the organization for 47 years,

00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:18.529
he reminded us that throughout his life,

00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:21.806
he saw optimism triumph over despair,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.154
that when you light the spark
of self-belief in people,

00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:28.576
even the poorest
can transform their lives.

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.542
My father passed away in December.
