about 400 million people
were living in ultra-poverty worldwide.

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:05.325
That's more than the populations
of the United States and Canada combined.

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:07.742
And when calamity strikes,

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:12.299
whether it's a pandemic,
a natural disaster or a manmade crisis,

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:15.188
these numbers spike astronomically higher.

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:19.814
My father, Fazle Abed,
gave up a corporate career

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:23.717
to establish BRAC
here in Bangladesh in 1972.

00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:25.572
Bangladesh was a wreck,

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:28.522
having just gone through
a devastating cyclone

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.365
followed by a brutal war for independence.
