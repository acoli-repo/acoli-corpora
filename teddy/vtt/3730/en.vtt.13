00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.542
My father passed away in December.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:36.523
He lit that spark for millions of people,

00:06:36.547 --> 00:06:38.558
and in the final days of his life,

00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:43.346
he implored us to continue to do so
for millions more.

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:46.971
This opportunity is ours for the taking,

00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:50.466
so let's stop imagining
a world without ultra-poverty

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.325
and start building that world together.

00:06:53.707 --> 00:06:54.944
Thank you.
