00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:33.047
and two children who were not in school
and were severely malnourished.

00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.336
With no one to turn to for help,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.828
she had no hope.

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:41.534
Jorina joined BRAC's
Graduation program in 2005.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.999
She received a dollar a week,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.182
two cows,

00:03:45.206 --> 00:03:46.757
enterprise training

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.019
and a weekly visit from a mentor.

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.464
She began to build her assets,

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:53.183
but most importantly,

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:57.100
she began to imagine a better future
for herself and her children.

00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.456
