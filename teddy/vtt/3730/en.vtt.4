00:01:57.645 --> 00:02:00.675
they would need to instill
hope and self-worth

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:02.807
so that, with a little support,

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.277
people could lift themselves
out of poverty.

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:09.128
BRAC went on to pioneer
the graduation approach,

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:13.233
a solution to ultra-poverty
that addresses both income poverty

00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:14.979
and the poverty of hope.

00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:17.883
The approach works primarily with women,

00:02:17.907 --> 00:02:21.141
because women are
the most affected by ultra-poverty

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:24.504
but also the ones most likely
to pull themselves and their families

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:25.680
out of it.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:27.337
Over a two-year period,

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.428
we essentially do four things.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.989
One, we meet a woman's basic needs
