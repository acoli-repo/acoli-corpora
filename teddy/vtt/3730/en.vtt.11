00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:32.474
and even the ones that do
fail to have significant long-term impact.

00:05:33.085 --> 00:05:35.739
We are working to engage governments

00:05:35.763 --> 00:05:40.201
to help them to adopt and scale
graduation programs themselves,

00:05:40.225 --> 00:05:44.128
maximizing the impact
of the billions of dollars

00:05:44.152 --> 00:05:47.179
they already allocate
to fight ultra-poverty.

00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:51.858
Our plan is to help
another 21 million people

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:54.349
lift themselves out of ultra-poverty

00:05:54.373 --> 00:05:57.577
in eight countries over the next six years

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.753
with BRAC teams on-site
and embedded in each country.
