00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.236
living on less than two dollars a day.

purpose and self-worth.

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:45.085
It means living in isolation,

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.430
because you're a burden

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.321
It means being unable
to imagine a better future

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:53.004
for yourself and your family.

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:55.764
