00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.066
to have found a solution
that worked for some people.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.616
He always wanted to know
whether we were being ambitious enough

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.013
in terms of scale.

00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:10.776
So when we achieved
nationwide scale in Bangladesh,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.900
he wanted to know
how we could scale it globally.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.967
And that has to involve governments.

00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.781
Governments already dedicate
billions of dollars

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:22.251
on poverty reduction programs.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.832
But so much of that money is wasted,

00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:27.993
because these programs
either don't reach the poorest,

00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:32.474
and even the ones that do
fail to have significant long-term impact.
