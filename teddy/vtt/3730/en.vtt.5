00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.989
One, we meet a woman's basic needs

00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:35.508
by giving her food or cash,

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:38.112
ensuring the minimum to survive.

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:41.362
Two, we move her
towards a decent livelihood

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:44.269
by giving her an asset, like livestock,

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.057
and training her to earn money from it.

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:50.355
Three, we train her to save, budget

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.248
and invest her new wealth.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.820
And four, we help
to integrate her socially,

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:58.180
first into groups of women like her

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.057
and then into her community.
