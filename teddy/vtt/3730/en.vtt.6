00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:00.057
and then into her community.

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:04.247
Each of these elements
is key to the success of the others,

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.009
but the real magic is the hope
and sense of possibility

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:11.602
the women develop through
the close mentorship they receive.

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:14.469
Let me tell you about Jorina.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:18.933
Jorina was born in a remote village
in northern Bangladesh.

00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:20.449
She never went to school,

00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:24.647
and at the age of 15,
she was married off to an abusive husband.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.710
He eventually abandoned her,

00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:28.514
leaving her with no income

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:33.047
and two children who were not in school
and were severely malnourished.
