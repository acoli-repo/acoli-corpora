00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.884
They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes,

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:37.676
“It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.838
but rather the movement of your minds!”

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:45.400
One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks –

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.015
the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world,

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:53.039
the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.960
But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer”

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.065
blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so,

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:03.998
defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking.
