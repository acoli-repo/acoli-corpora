00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.955
they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.850
By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases,"

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.231
meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings.

00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:44.575
Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:47.456
and trigger a spiritual breakthrough.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:50.189
Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.095
it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:56.234
But like the monks before us,

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.074
we can puzzle over them together,

00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:02.122
and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations.
