The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case."

00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:05.942
But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible.

00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:10.869
They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.711
On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code -

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:19.405
such as living without physical
or mental attachments,

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.127
avoiding binary thinking,

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:25.079
and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature."

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.815
But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.955
they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox.
