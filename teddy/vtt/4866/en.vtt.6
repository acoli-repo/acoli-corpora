00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:00.237
This type of conflict –

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:04.278
examining the grey area between the letter
of the law and the spirit of the law –

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:06.861
was common in kōans.

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:08.994
In addition to exploring ambiguity,

00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:11.199
kōans often ridiculed characters

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.841
claiming total understanding 
of the world around them.

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.442

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.878
The first monk refers to

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:27.345
while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move,

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:29.761
but rather the wind blowing.

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.884
They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes,
