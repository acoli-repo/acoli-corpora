The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one –

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.150
both arguing monks

Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans.

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:20.655
Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us,

00:04:20.655 --> 00:04:23.940
nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.567
can resolve them for you.

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:29.752
That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:33.508
It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles
