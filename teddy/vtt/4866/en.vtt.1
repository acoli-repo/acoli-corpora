00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.964
For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.350
and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.558
was the true path to enlightenment.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:41.029
But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult.

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.166
So to help practice living 
with these mysteries,

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:49.043
the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:53.210
and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.764
The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case."
