00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.976
of distributing parenting
information leaflets via bread wrappers --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.336
bread wrappers that were being delivered
to families in a conflict zone in Syria

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.000
by humanitarian workers.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.976
So that's what we did.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.976
The bread wrappers haven't changed
at all in their appearance,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.200
except for the addition
of two pieces of paper.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.696
One was a parenting information leaflet
that had basic advice and information

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.136
that normalized to the parent
what they might be experiencing,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.176
and what their child
might be experiencing.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.016
And information on how they could
support themselves and their children,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.256
such as information like spending
time talking to your child,
