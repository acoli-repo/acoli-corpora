00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.256
such as information like spending
time talking to your child,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.376
showing them more affection,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.456
being more patient with your child,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.296
talking to your children.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.896
The other piece of paper
was a feedback questionnaire,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.520
and of course, there was a pen.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.656
So is this simply leaflet distribution,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.496
or is this actually a possible means
of delivering psychological first aid

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.576
that provides warm,
secure, loving parenting?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.680
We managed to distribute
3,000 of these in just one week.
