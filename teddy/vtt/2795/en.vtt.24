00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.896
and that 1.5 billion people
are experiencing armed conflict --

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.616
many of whom are now
joining our communities --

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.536
we cannot afford to turn a blind eye

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.280
to the needs of those
who are experiencing war and displacement.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.256
We must prioritize
these families' needs --

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.120
both those who are internally displaced,
and those who are refugees worldwide.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.096
These needs must be prioritized
by NGO workers, policy makers,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.416
the WHO, the UNHCR
and every single one of us
