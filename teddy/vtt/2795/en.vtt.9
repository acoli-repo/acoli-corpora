00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.296
bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,
fear of loud noises,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.176
fear of nightmares --

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.920
terrifying, terrifying nightmares.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.640
These families had been through
what we had been watching on the TV.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.456
The mothers --

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.656
almost half of them
were now widows of war,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.456
or didn't even know
if their husbands were dead or alive --

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.160
described how they felt
they were coping so badly.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.536
They watched their children change
and they had no idea how to help them.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520
They didn't know how to answer
their children's questions.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.776
What I found incredibly astonishing
and so motivational
