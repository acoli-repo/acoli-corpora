But sadly, these attempts
are almost always useless.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.736
Refugee camp doctors, when available,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.536
are almost always too busy,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.640
or don't have the knowledge or the time
for basic parenting supports.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.480
Refugee camp teachers and other parents
are just like them --

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.600
part of a new refugee community
who's struggling with new needs.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200
So then we began to think.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.120
How could we help these families?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.376
The families were struggling with things
much bigger than they could cope with.
