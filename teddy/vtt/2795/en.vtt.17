00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.056
because the refugee crisis

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.496
is one that is having an effect
on every single one of us.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.135
We're bombarded with images daily
of statistics and of photos,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.736
and that's not surprising,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.015
because by last month,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.136
over one million refugees
had reached Europe.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.360
One million.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.096
Refugees are joining our communities,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.616
they're becoming our neighbors,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.120
their children are attending
our children's schools.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.840
So we've adapted the leaflet
to meet the needs of European refugees,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.936
and we have them online, open-access,
