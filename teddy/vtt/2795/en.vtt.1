for the development
of emotional and behavioral problems.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.816
Children, as we can only imagine,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.920
will feel worried, threatened and at risk.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.760
But there is good news.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.136
The quality of care
that children receive in their families

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.616
can have a more significant
effect on their well-being

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.320
than from the actual experiences of war
that they have been exposed to.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.176
So actually, children can be protected

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.640
by warm, secure parenting
during and after conflict.
