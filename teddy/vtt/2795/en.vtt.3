00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.160
chaos, destruction

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.612
and people screaming and running.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.376
It was always the people screaming
and running that really got me the most,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640
especially those
terrified-looking children.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.096
I was a mother to two young,
typically inquisitive children.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.696
They were five and six then,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.776
at an age where they typically
asked lots and lots of questions,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920
and expected real, convincing answers.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.776
So, I began to wonder
what it might be like

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.200
to parent my children
in a war zone and a refugee camp.
