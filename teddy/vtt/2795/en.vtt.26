WEBVTT

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.160
will prioritize and recognize the primary
role of the family in supporting children.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.416
Family mental health
will be shouting loud and clear

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.200
in global, international agenda.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.776
And children will be less likely
to enter social service systems

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.376
in resettlement countries

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.080
because their families
would have had support earlier on.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.256
And we will be more open-minded,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.096
more welcoming, more caring

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.600
and more trusting to those
who are joining our communities.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.000
We need to stop wars.
