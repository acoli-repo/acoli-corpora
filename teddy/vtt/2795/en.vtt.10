What I found incredibly astonishing
and so motivational

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.696
was that these families were
so motivated to support their children.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.136
Despite all these challenges they faced,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.416
they were trying to help their children.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.056
They were making attempts
at seeking support from NGO workers,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.976
from refugee camp teachers,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.216
professional medics,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.440
other parents.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.256
One mother I met had only been
in a camp for four days,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.896
and had already made two attempts

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.336
at seeking support
for her eight-year-old daughter

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.400
who was having terrifying nightmares.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.920
But sadly, these attempts
are almost always useless.
