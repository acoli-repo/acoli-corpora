00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.456
Not quite sure what she expected me to do,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.336
I looked at the young girl and smiled,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.736
and in Arabic I said,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.776
"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.000
"What's your name?"

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.456
She looked at me really
confused and unengaged,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.080
but then said, "Halul."

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.376
Halul is the pet's name
for the Arabic female name, Hala,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.280
and is only really used
to refer to really young girls.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.960
At that point I realized that actually
Hala was probably much older than 13.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.080
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old
mother to three young children.
