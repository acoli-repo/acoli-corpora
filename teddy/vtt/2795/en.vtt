00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.800
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people
experience armed conflict.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.576
In response, people are forced
to flee their country,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.720
leaving over 15 million refugees.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.856
Children, without a doubt,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.360
are the most innocent
and vulnerable victims ...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.256
but not just from
the obvious physical dangers,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
but from the often unspoken effects
that wars have on their families.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.496
The experiences of war
leave children at a real high risk

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.439
for the development
of emotional and behavioral problems.
