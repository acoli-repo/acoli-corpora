00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.416
the WHO, the UNHCR
and every single one of us

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.840
in whatever capacity it is
that we function in our society.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.776
When we begin to recognize
the individual faces of the conflict,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.296
when we begin to notice
those intricate emotions on their faces,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.200
we begin to see them as humans, too.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.696
We begin to see
the needs of these families,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.400
and these are the real human needs.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.536
When these family needs are prioritized,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.856
interventions for children
in humanitarian settings

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.160
will prioritize and recognize the primary
role of the family in supporting children.
