In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480
in the University of Manchester
School of Psychological Sciences.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.496
Like many of you here,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
I watched the crisis in Syria
unfold in front of me on the TV.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.856
My family is originally from Syria,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.136
and very early on,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.840
I lost several family members
in really horrifying ways.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.440
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family
and watch the TV.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.616
We've all seen those scenes:

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.696
bombs destroying buildings,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.160
chaos, destruction
