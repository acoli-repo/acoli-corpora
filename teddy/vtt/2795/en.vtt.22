When they reached the refugee camp

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.016
and she knew they were finally
in some kind of safety,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.440
she completely withdrew
to acting like her old childhood self.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.160
She completely rejected her family --

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.440
her children, her husband.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.320
Hala simply could no longer cope.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.496
This is a parenting struggle
with a really tough ending,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.336
but sadly, it's not uncommon.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.336
Those who experience
armed conflict and displacement

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.960
will face serious emotional struggles.
