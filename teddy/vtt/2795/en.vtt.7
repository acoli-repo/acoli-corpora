00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.256
the first step must obviously be
to ask them what they're struggling with,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.496
right?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.896
I mean, it seems obvious.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.296
But it's often those
that are the most vulnerable,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.736
that we're trying to support,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.096
that we actually don't ask.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.296
How many times have we just assumed
we know exactly the right thing

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.960
that's going to help someone or something
without actually asking them first?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.056
So I travelled to refugee camps
in Syria and in Turkey,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.440
and I sat with families, and I listened.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.976
I listened to their parenting challenges,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.256
I listened to their parenting struggles

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.496
and I listened to their call for help.
