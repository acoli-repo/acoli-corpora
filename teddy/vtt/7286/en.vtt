00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:03.676
What is causing climate change?

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:07.076
I mean, itâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions
from human activities, of course.

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.156
But which human activities?

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.876
Who specifically is burning
all of these fossil fuels,

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.396
and for what and where?

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.676
It sounded strange when I first heard it,

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.956
but I have come to learn
that even today in the 21st century,

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:23.396
scientists have surprisingly
little information about this question.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:26.196
So I'm part of a new coalition
of scientists, activists,

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.236
and actually tech companies
working to address this issue.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.636
It's been a stranger journey
than I expected.
