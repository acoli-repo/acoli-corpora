00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:03.501
For these types of questions, we need cameras.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.418
About 150 years ago,

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:07.388
the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.175
to solve the galloping horse mystery.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.559
Using careful photography,

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:14.765
Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops,

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.556
a horse really is flying.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.927
"Look, ma! No hooves!"

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:22.653
Since then, photography has found its way

00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:25.815
into all aspects of math and science.

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:28.025
It enhances our understanding of a world

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.835
we thought we could already see,

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.858
but it's one which we really need help
