00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:31.102
to produced animated movies

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:34.576
that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton,

00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:35.972
and into the flesh,

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:37.019
and through the bones,

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:37.848
and the veins,

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:39.010
and,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.349
perhaps I should have suggested

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.234
you don't watch this during dinner,

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.761
my bad.

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:45.384
In classrooms today, the camera,

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:48.241
now present in just about every phone and computer,

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.176
allows the youngest scientists

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.570
to observe the world around them,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.989
to document it,

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.127
and to share their findings online.

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:56.658
Whether it's the change of seasons

00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:58.916
or the growth of the germinating seed,

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.747
cameras are allowing us to see a beautiful world
