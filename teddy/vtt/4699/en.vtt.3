00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.858
but it's one which we really need help

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.701
to see a little better.

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.356
It's not always a matter of the world

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:38.757
moving by too quickly for our eyes to process.

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:41.220
Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.125
that are too small for the naked eye.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.058
Botanists use multiple photographs

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:48.190
to show the life cycle of plants

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.602
and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.273
to follow the sun in what is called phototropism,

growing towards the light.

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:58.321
Mathematicians have used photos

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.894
to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip
