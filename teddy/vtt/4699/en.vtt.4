00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.894
to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:02.563
the crack sound comes

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.940
when the whip is breaking the sound barrier.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.461
Meteorologists and environmental scientists

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.382
show the growth of major hurricanes

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.197
and the recession over the years

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.325
of many of the world's glaciers.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:15.590
Slow-motion film or high-speed photography

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.237
have shown us the beating of a hummingbird's wings

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.999
and the course of a bullet through its target.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.043
In one project, cadavers,

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.418
that's dead bodies,

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:28.011
were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs.

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:29.508
The discs were photographed

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:31.102
to produced animated movies
