00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.690
so much about the world.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.021
Our eyes are how we find partners,

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.995
how we understand the people around us,

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.273
how we read,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:38.194
and how we watch game shows on TV

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:39.992
where people get knocked into cold water

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:41.929
by padded wrecking balls.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.499
Yup, the human eye is pretty neat,

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.740
and we're lucky enough to have two of them.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.692
But, there are things that,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.196
despite looking really hard,

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.322
we still can't quite see.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.283
For example, you can watch a horse galloping,

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.954
but your eyes can't keep up with its fast-moving hooves

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.712
enough to figure out whether all four feet

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:59.121
are ever off the ground simultaneously.
