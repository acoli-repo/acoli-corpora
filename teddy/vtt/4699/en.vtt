00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.492
The human eye is one of the most powerful machines

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:18.705
on the planet.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.149
It's like a 500 megapixel camera

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.133
that can run in bright light,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.437
in near darkness,

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.142
and even under water, though not real well.

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:28.843
It communicates to our brains

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.690
so much about the world.
