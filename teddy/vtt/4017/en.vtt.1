00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.256
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.706
Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.217
and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.763
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:48.573
Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn't there.

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.537
And so, we didn't know what to do.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.925
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.753
Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:58.875
and others still we simply said to them,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.213
"Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences."
