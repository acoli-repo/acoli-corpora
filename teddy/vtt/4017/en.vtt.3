00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:30.434
objectively, repeatedly,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.933
which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.

00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:35.605
Now as it turns out,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.859
the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:44.735
that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:47.706
Now, making war --

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.559
this is something that we are good at.

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:55.133
We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.470
And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:04.084
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
