He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:35.227

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:39.946
He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.981
He processed his memories so much

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:46.234
that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:47.543
in his sleep.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.953
And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.348
he told me,

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:57.773
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:00.058
that I haven't had nightmares."
