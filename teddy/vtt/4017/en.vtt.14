00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:09.082
Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,

00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:10.763
but with enough practice,

00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:15.993
those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.940
They don't feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,

00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:23.770
and that is an immensely
better place to be.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.255

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:31.315
And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.
