00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.407
and they fought right where they lived.

00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:35.108
So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:38.024
there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:40.174
because we never really did.

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:42.619
But thankfully, today,

00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:45.658
most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:49.661
and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.182
now have the technology to put
our warriors through advanced training,

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.023
drop them in to fight
anywhere on the globe

00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:57.506
and when they're done,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.555
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
