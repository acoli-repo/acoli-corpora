00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:04.084
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.443
And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.788
we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:10.239
We are good at making war.

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.885
And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.

00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:18.176
Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.387
we begin to see that we
have not been as good

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.031
at preparing them to come home.

00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:24.649
Why is that?

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:29.005
Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.407
and they fought right where they lived.
