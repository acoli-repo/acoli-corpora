00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.016
So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.245
you get problems.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.724
You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren't present.

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:41.071
You begin not trusting family or friends.

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:45.999
Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.094
It's just that the probability
of encountering them

00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.388
compared to combat

00:04:50.412 --> 00:04:52.720
is astronomically lower.

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:56.815
So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.223
We do train them, however,
to adjust caution

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.888
according to where they are.
