00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:30.223
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.

00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:33.875
And it will take time
to generate new neurons

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.105
that reach normal functions.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.189
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:45.928
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.566
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.153
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.311
or associated with stress.

00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:58.019
So the next question is:

00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:00.217
can we control neurogenesis?
