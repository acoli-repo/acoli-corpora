and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:

00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:32.552
how do you find your bike

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:36.092
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.258
but in a slightly different position?

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:42.552
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:47.438
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.948
So in an animal model of depression,

00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:53.976
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.743
And if we give antidepressants,

00:03:56.767 --> 00:04:00.221
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,
