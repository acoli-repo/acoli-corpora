00:03:56.767 --> 00:04:00.221
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.388
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:08.872
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:13.500
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.357
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.477
So by then, Robert had understood

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.199
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression

00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:25.818
even after being cured of their cancer,

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:30.223
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.
