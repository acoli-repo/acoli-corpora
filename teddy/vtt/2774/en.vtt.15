00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.147
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,

00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:33.994
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:35.861
Omega-3 fatty acids,

00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:38.096
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.558
will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:45.603
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat

00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:48.367
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.

00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:53.414
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.

00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:56.703
However, not everything is lost;

00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.779
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,

00:07:59.803 --> 00:08:03.294
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.
