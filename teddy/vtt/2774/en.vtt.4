00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.716
And if we slice through the hippocampus

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.008
and zoom in,

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.833
what you actually see here in blue

00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:11.430
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.824
So when it comes to the human brain --

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:19.380
my colleague Jonas Frisén
from the Karolinska Institutet,

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:25.144
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day

00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:26.366
in the hippocampus.

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:28.858
You might think this is not much,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.271
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.
