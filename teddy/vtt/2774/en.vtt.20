Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.

00:10:05.212 --> 00:10:07.457
Now, I told you you changed my life --

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:09.259
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

00:10:09.283 --> 00:10:10.830
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.972
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.520
Do I have to run?

00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:20.010
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,

00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:21.639
getting oxygen to the brain?

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.798
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:25.838
ST: So for the moment,

00:10:25.862 --> 00:10:29.102
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:34.163
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --
