00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.073
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.270
when it comes to neurogenesis --

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.382
and this is the hippocampus.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.932
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:44.035
And what we've known already
for very long,

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:48.824
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.390
However, what we
have learned more recently

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:57.072
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.746
where new neurons can be generated.
