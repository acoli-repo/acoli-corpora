00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:30.034
How about stress?

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:36.168
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:37.804
How about sleep deprivation?

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:42.074
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:43.319
How about sex?

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:45.566
Oh, wow!

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.857
(Laughter)

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:50.634
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.

00:05:50.658 --> 00:05:52.810
However, it's all about balance here.

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:55.047
We don't want to fall in a situation --

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:56.999
(Laughter)

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.857
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:02.110
(Laughter)
