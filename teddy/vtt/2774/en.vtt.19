but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:31.851
and how much of it you eat.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.874
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --

00:09:37.898 --> 00:09:41.563
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:45.571
and how we can control their survival
and their production.

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:50.435
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.648
And on your side --

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:55.102
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.849
Thank you.

00:09:56.873 --> 00:10:02.832
