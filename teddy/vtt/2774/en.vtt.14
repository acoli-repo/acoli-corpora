00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.612
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.286
What you eat will have an effect

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.224
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.

00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:10.208
So here we have a sample of diet --

00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:13.509
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.

00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:16.568
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:21.686
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:25.610
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:27.773
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:29.120
Intake of flavonoids,

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.147
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,
