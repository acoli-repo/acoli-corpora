00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:02.445
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:06.333
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,

00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:10.540
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:16.460
So we think that the effect of diet

00:09:16.484 --> 00:09:20.079
on mental health, on memory and mood,

00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:24.575
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:09:24.994 --> 00:09:26.914
And it's not only what you eat,

00:09:26.938 --> 00:09:30.003
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it
