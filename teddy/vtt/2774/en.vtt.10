00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:00.217
can we control neurogenesis?

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.257
The answer is yes.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.423
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:09.382
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:14.090
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.280
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:17.963
Are we ready?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.709
OK, let's go.

00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:21.621
So what about learning?

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:23.701
Increasing?

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:24.884
Yes.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.694
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:30.034
How about stress?
