00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.084
showing that the environment
can have an impact

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:31.997
on the production of new neurons.

00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:36.275
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:38.544
that had no running wheel in its cage.

00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:42.603
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:48.384
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.004
that had a running wheel in its cage.

00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:52.551
So you see the massive increase

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:55.388
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.612
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.
