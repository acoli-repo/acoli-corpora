00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:00.407
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.947
then we block certain memory abilities.

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:10.633
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.455
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:15.659
We are still learning a lot,

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:18.746
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.673
but also for the quality of the memory.

00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:25.742
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:30.448
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:
