00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.924
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.138
[Neurogenesis]

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.932
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:11.581
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.344
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:21.587
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.310
wanted to come to my lab

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:26.158
to understand the topic
a little bit better.

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.136
And I took him for a tour

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.073
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain
