00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:32.620
So all of this data,

00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:35.225
where we need to look
at the cellular level,

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.756
has been generated using animal models.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.851
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:49.033
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:52.541
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:57.322
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,

00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:02.445
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --
