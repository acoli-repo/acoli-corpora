00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.271
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:34.715
But by the time we turn 50,

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.415
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.654
with adult-born neurons.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:48.284
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.022
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:54.563
And in the lab we have shown

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:57.823
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain

00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:00.407
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,
