And I responded to him,

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.179
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:37.741
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:42.868
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.606
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.812
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:51.408
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:56.209
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.924
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.
