"Hey, this cell's all right.
Nothing to see here, move along.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.854
Look somewhere else."

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:33.963
So in other words,

00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:38.731
as long as our cells are wearing
a thick coat of sialic acid,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.417
they look fabulous, right?

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:43.388
It's amazing.

00:09:44.524 --> 00:09:47.678
And what if you could strip off that coat

00:09:47.702 --> 00:09:50.000
and take that sugar away?

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:53.023
Well, your immune system

00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.248
might be able to see that cancer cell
for what it really is:

00:09:57.272 --> 00:09:59.496
something that needs to be destroyed.
