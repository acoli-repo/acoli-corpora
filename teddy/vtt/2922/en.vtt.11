00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:30.822
so I would encourage everybody
to get familiar with this word.

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:34.467
Sialic acid is not
the kind of sugar that we eat.

00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:36.047
Those are different sugars.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:39.566
This is a kind of sugar
that is actually found

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.718
at certain levels on all
of the cells in your body.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.610
It's actually quite common on your cells.

00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:47.704
But for some reason,

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:53.939
cancer cells, at least in a successful,
progressive disease,

00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:57.072
tend to have more sialic acid

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:59.443
than a normal, healthy cell would have.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:00.909
And why?
