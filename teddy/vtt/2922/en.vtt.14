00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:01.668
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:04.196
But once in a while,
a cell might taste bad.

00:07:04.744 --> 00:07:06.555
Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:08.962
and when those immune cells
get the bad taste,

00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:11.795
they launch an all-out strike
and kill those cells.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.783
So we know that.

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:18.223
We also know that if you can
potentiate that tasting,

00:07:18.247 --> 00:07:22.075
if you can encourage those immune cells
to actually take a big old bite

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:23.342
out of a cancer cell,

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:26.957
you get a better job protecting
yourself from cancer every day

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:28.713
and maybe even curing a cancer.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.355
And there are now a couple of drugs
out there in the market
