Why do cancers have different sugars?
What's the importance of that?

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:04.616
Why does it happen, and what
can we do about it if it does turn out

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.395
to be related to the disease process?

00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.994
So, one of the changes that we study

00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:18.563
is an increase in the density
of a particular sugar

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:20.916
that's called sialic acid.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:25.541
And I think this is going to be
one of the most important sugars

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:26.723
of our times,

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:30.822
so I would encourage everybody
to get familiar with this word.
