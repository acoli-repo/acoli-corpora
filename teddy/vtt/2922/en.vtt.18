But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
of that sugar, sialic acid,

00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:08.699
well, it starts to taste pretty good.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:14.151
And there's a protein on immune cells
that grabs the sialic acid,

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:17.976
and if that protein
gets held at that synapse

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.424
between the immune cell
and the cancer cell,

00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:23.156
it puts that immune cell to sleep.

00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:27.111
The sialic acids are telling
the immune cell,

00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:30.336
"Hey, this cell's all right.
Nothing to see here, move along.
