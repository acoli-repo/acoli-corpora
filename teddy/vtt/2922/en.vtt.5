00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.978
How many people are also blood type O?

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.160
Put your hands up.

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:35.377
It's a pretty common one,

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.336
so when so few hands go up,
either you're not paying attention

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.250
or you don't know your blood type,
and both of those are bad.

00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:42.289
(Laughter)

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.976
But for those of you who share
the blood type O with me,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.715
what this means is that we have
this chemical structure

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.777
on the surface of our blood cells:

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:54.019
three simple sugars linked together
to make a more complex sugar.

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:56.311
And that, by definition, is blood type O.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.496
Now, how many people are blood type A?
