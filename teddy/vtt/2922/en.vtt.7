00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.935
And when this was figured out,

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.697
which is now back in the previous century,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.238
this enabled one of the most important
medical procedures in the world,

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:40.640
which, of course,
is the blood transfusion.

00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:42.560
And by knowing what your blood type is,

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.176
we can make sure,
if you ever need a transfusion,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.721
that your donor has the same blood type,

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.066
so that your body
doesn't see foreign sugars,

00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:54.220
which it wouldn't like
and would certainly reject.

00:03:56.113 --> 00:04:00.355
What else are the sugars on the surface
of your cells trying to tell us?
