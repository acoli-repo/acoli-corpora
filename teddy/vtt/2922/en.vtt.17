00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:32.148
which we've been fighting for a long time

00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:34.252
and mostly losing the battle with.

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:36.384
So this is very exciting.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:39.319
Now what does this have to do with sugars?

00:08:39.343 --> 00:08:42.063
Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.

00:08:42.944 --> 00:08:49.280
When an immune cell snuggles
up against a cancer cell to take a taste,

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.953
it's looking for signs of disease,

00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:53.896
and if it finds those signs,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.166
the cell gets activated and it launches
a missile strike and kills the cell.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:05.079
But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
of that sugar, sialic acid,
