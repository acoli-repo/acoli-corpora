I can tell you that we do know
some information

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:05.492
that comes from these sugars,

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.451
and it's turned out already
to be incredibly important

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:10.295
in the world of medicine.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:14.438
For example, one thing
your sugars are telling us

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:15.919
is your blood type.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:21.195
So your blood cells, your red blood
cells, are coated with sugars,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.896
and the chemical structures of those
sugars determine your blood type.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.843
So for example, I know
that I am blood type O.

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.978
How many people are also blood type O?
