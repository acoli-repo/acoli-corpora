00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.624
And when I started thinking about
all these complex sugars

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:36.574
that are like this foliage on our cells,

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.715
it became one of the most interesting
problems that I encountered

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.743
as a biologist and also as a chemist.

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:46.592
And so now we tend
to think about the sugars

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.884
that are populating
the surface of our cells

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.703
as a language.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:56.223
They have a lot of information
stored in their complex structures.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:59.711
But what are they trying to tell us?
