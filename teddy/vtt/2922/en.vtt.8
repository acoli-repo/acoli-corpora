What else are the sugars on the surface
of your cells trying to tell us?

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:05.805
Well, those sugars might be telling us
that you have cancer.

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.960
So a few decades ago,

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:14.377
correlations began to emerge
from the analysis of tumor tissue.

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:18.912
And the typical scenario is a patient
would have a tumor detected,

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:22.764
and the tissue would be removed
in a biopsy procedure

00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:25.558
and then sent down to a pathology lab

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:29.713
where that tissue would be analyzed
to look for chemical changes

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:34.451
that might inform the oncologist
about the best course of treatment.
