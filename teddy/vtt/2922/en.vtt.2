that it's much more complicated than that,

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:06.367
and that the sugars on our cells
are actually very complex.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:12.695
And if you could shrink yourself down
to a little miniature airplane

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.501
and fly right along
the surface of your cells,

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.891

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.116
with geographical features.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.170
And now, the complex sugars
are these trees and bushes --

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:27.726

And when I started thinking about
all these complex sugars
