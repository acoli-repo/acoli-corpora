00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.186
And so this is what we're doing in my lab.

00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:06.026
We're developing new medicines

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.107
that are basically
cell-surface lawnmowers --

00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:13.514
molecules that go down
to the surface of these cancer cells

00:10:13.538 --> 00:10:16.403
and just cut off those sialic acids,

00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:20.732
so that the immune system
can reach its full potential

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:23.413
in eliminating those cancer
cells from our body.

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:27.114
So in closing,

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:29.972
let me just remind you again:

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.263
your cells are coated with sugars.
