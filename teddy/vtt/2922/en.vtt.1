00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.640
and this was in, let's just
call it the 1980s --

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.814
people didn't know much about why
our cells are coated with sugar.

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:40.805
And when I dug through my notes,
what I noticed I had written down

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.374
is that the sugar coating on our cells
is like the sugar coating

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:46.604
on a peanut M and M.

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:50.864
And people thought
the sugar coating on our cells

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:52.718
was like a protective coating

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:55.993
that somehow made our cells
stronger or tougher.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.060
But we now know, many decades later,

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:01.360
that it's much more complicated than that,
