00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.263
your cells are coated with sugars.

00:10:32.972 --> 00:10:37.667
The sugars are telling cells
around that cell

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:39.611
whether the cell is good or bad.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.847
And that's important,

00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.927
because our immune system needs
to leave the good cells alone.

00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:47.421
Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:51.463
But once in a while,
cancers get the ability

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:53.043
to express these new sugars.

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.399
And now that we understand

00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:57.583
how those sugars mesmerize
the immune system,

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:01.792
we can come up with new medicines
to wake up those immune cells,
