What we now know
is that your immune cells,

00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:37.047
which are the white blood cells
coursing through your bloodstream,

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.727
protect you on a daily basis
from things gone bad --

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:43.092
including cancer.

00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:45.942
And so in this picture,

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:48.687
those little green balls
are your immune cells,

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.659
and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.015
And these immune cells go around
and taste all the cells in your body.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.334
That's their job.

00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:01.668
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.
