00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:01.743
Right here.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:04.728
That means you have
an enzyme in your cells

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.168
that adds one more building block,

00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:08.567
that red sugar,

00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.415
to build a more complex structure.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:13.506
And how many people are blood type B?

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:15.463
Quite a few.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.215
You have a slightly different enzyme
than the A people,

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.355
so you build a slightly
different structure,

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.492
and those of you that are AB

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:25.708
have the enzyme from your mother,
the other enzyme from your father,

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:29.507
and now you make both of these structures
in roughly equal proportions.

00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.935
And when this was figured out,
