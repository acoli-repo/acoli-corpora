00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.292
When we think of Nepal,

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.747
we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.019
of the Himalayas,

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.468
the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.514
or the huge expanse of its grasslands.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.721
What some of us may not realize

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.045
is that in the Himalayan foothills,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.219
where the climate is much warmer

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.307
and the landscape much greener,

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.733
there lives a great diversity of wildlife,

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.469
including the one-horned rhinoceros,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.143
the Asian elephant

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:31.218
and the Bengal tiger.
