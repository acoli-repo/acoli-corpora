00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:31.218
and the Bengal tiger.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.070
But unfortunately, these animals

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.733
are under constant threat from poachers

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.045
who hunt and kill them for their body parts.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.254
To stop the killing of these animals,

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:43.852
battalions of soldiers and rangers

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.101
are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.726
but that is not an easy task,

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:51.397
because these soldiers have to patrol

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:54.388
thousands of hectares of forests on foot

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.029
or elephant backs.

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:58.514
It is also risky for these soldiers

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.895
when they get into gunfights with poachers,
