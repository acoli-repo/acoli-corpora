00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:31.547
We brought a few of these to Indonesia

00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:33.690
for the first few test flights.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.505
Since then, we've been building drones

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.187
for our collaborators from around the world,

00:08:38.187 --> 00:08:40.367
and these include fellow biologists

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:44.295
and partners from major conservation organizations.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.585
Perhaps the best and most rewarding part

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.711
about working with these collaborators

00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.191
is the feedback they give us

00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:52.834
on how to improve our drones.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:54.965
Building drones for us is

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:57.129
a constant work in progress.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:00.206
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of
