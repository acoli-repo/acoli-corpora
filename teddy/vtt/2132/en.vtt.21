00:10:27.812 --> 00:10:30.780
on our rooftops. Some of us still do.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.045
A drone could be used to do the same job

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:34.704
much more efficiently.

00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:36.410
Why not equip a drone

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.413
with a scanning radio receiver,

00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:40.407
fly that over the forest canopy

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:41.945
in a certain pattern

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:44.737
which would allow the user or the operator

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:47.319
to triangulate the location

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:50.306
of these radio-collared animals remotely

00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:53.279
without having to step foot in the forest.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.782
A third and perhaps most exciting way

00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:57.312
of using these drones

00:10:57.312 --> 00:11:00.262
is to fly them to a really remote,
