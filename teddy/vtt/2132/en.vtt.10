00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:02.158
and to use a pair of binoculars
to look up in the treetops

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:05.576
where you might find an orangutan or its nest.

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.302
Now as you can imagine,

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:10.272
that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,

00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:11.990
and costly process,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.786
so we were hoping that drones

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:17.111
could significantly reduce the cost of surveying

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.678
for orangutan populations in Indonesia

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:22.145
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:24.500
So we were very excited when we captured

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.670
our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.834
And this is it; this is the first ever picture
