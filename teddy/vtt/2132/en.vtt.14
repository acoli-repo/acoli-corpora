00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.544
You could even still see the processed

00:07:00.544 --> 00:07:04.172
wooden planks left on the ground.

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:06.461
But perhaps the most exciting part

00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:09.027
about taking pictures from the air is

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:11.453
we could later stitch these pictures together

00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:14.316
using special software to create a map

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:17.083
of the entire landscape, and this map

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.098
gives us crucial information

00:07:19.098 --> 00:07:21.366
for monitoring land use change,

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:25.113
to let us know where and when
plantations might be expanding,

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:27.390
where forests might be contracting,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.772
or where fires might be breaking out.
