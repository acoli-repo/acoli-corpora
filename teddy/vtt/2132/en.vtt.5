00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420
to program a mission,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.826
to tell the drone where to go.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.903
Now people I talk to are often surprised

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:37.234
when they hear that these are the only

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:40.341
four components that make a conservation drone,

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.845
but they are even more surprised

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:45.345
when I tell them how affordable
these components are.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:47.631
The facts is, a conservation drone

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.890
doesn't cost very much more than

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.867
a good laptop computer

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.126
or a decent pair of binoculars.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.098
So now that you've built
your own conservation drone,

00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:00.260
you probably want to go fly it,
