00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:00.206
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.820
their range, their ruggedness,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.498
and the amount of payload they can carry.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:07.540
We also work with collaborators

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.827
to discover new ways of using these drones.

00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:14.107
For example, camera traps are a common tool

00:09:14.107 --> 00:09:18.002
used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:19.563
hiding in the forests,

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:21.897
but these are motion-activated cameras,

00:09:21.897 --> 00:09:24.538
so they snap a picture every time an animal

00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:26.210
crosses their path.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.762
But the problem with camera traps

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:31.505
is that the researcher has to go back to the forest
