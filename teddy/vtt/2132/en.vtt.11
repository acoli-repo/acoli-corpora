00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.834
And this is it; this is the first ever picture

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:33.874
of orangutan nests taken with a drone.

00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:35.898
Since then we have taken pictures

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:37.516
of dozens of these nests

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:40.285
from around various parts of Southeast Asia,

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.528
and we're now working with computer scientists

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:46.447
to develop algorithms that can automatically count

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.464
the number of nests from the thousands

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:51.583
of photos we've collected so far.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.541
But nests are not the only objects

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.331
these drones can detect.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.640
This is a wild orangutan

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.161
happily feeding on top of a palm tree,
