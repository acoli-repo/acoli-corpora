00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:31.505
is that the researcher has to go back to the forest

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:34.958
every so often to retrieve those images,

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.610
and that takes a lot of time,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.444
especially if there are dozens

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:41.572
or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:44.383
Now a drone could be designed to perform the task

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:46.107
much more efficiently.

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.777
This drone, carrying a special sensor,

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:51.118
could be flown over the forest

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:53.865
and remotely download these images

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:58.002
from wi-fi–enabled cameras.

00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:00.139
Radio collars are another tool
