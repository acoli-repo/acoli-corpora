So what is a drone?

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.846
Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.947
is simply a model aircraft

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:07.392
fitted with an autopilot system,

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:11.661
and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.715
a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:17.974
and a few other sensors.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:19.393
Now a drone like this

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:21.599
is meant to carry a useful payload,

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.382
such as a video camera

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.370
or a photographic camera.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.719
It also requires a software that allows the user

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420
to program a mission,
