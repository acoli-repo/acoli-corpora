00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.772
or where fires might be breaking out.

00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:33.004
Aerial images could also be processed

00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:35.313
to produce three-dimensional

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:37.310
computer models of forests.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.263
Now these models are not just visually appealing,

00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:42.764
but they are also geometrically accurate,

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:45.541
which means researchers can now measure

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:47.666
the distance between trees,

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.961
calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,

00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.160
and so on, all of which are important information

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.473
for monitoring the health of these forests.

00:07:57.473 --> 00:07:59.926
Recently, we've also begun experimenting

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.990
with thermal imaging cameras.
