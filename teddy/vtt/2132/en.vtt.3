00:01:29.268 --> 00:01:31.742
a bird's-eye view of the landscape,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.777
but it also allows you to capture detailed,

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:38.759
high-resolution images of objects on the ground.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.268
This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.205
taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.168
in the lowlands of Nepal.

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.399
Now we believe that drones have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.207
tremendous potential,

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.985
not only for combating wildlife crime,

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.948
but also for monitoring the health

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.487
of these wildlife populations.

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:00.337
So what is a drone?
