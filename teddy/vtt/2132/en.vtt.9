00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.149
Well, when we built our first prototype drone,

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.667
our main objective was to fly it over

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:37.556
a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:40.605
to look for the nest of a species of great ape

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.761
known as the orangutan.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.417
The reason we wanted to do that was because

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.446
we needed to know how many individuals

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:50.833
of this species are still left in that forest.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.019
Now the traditional method of surveying

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:56.621
for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.508
carrying heavy equipment

00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:02.158
and to use a pair of binoculars
to look up in the treetops
