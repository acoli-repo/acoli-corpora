00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.895
when they get into gunfights with poachers,

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.911
and therefore Nepal is always looking

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:06.207
for new ways to help with protecting the forests

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.184
and wildlife.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.693
Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.406
in the fight against wildlife crime,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.112

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:18.386

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.900
For about a year now, my colleagues and I

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.160
have been building drones for Nepal

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.658
and training the park protection personnel

00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:27.636
on the use of these drones.

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:29.268
Not only does a drone give you

00:01:29.268 --> 00:01:31.742
a bird's-eye view of the landscape,
