00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.958
and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.300
And often we'll go about this mission

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.360
taking pictures or videos along the way,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.294

00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.441
sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,

worrying that the drone will not return.

Usually it does, and when it does,

00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:24.849

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.756
So what can we do with a conservation drone?

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.149
Well, when we built our first prototype drone,
