00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:00.260
you probably want to go fly it,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.193
but how does one fly a drone?

00:03:02.193 --> 00:03:03.785
Well, actually, you don't,

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.275
because the drone flies itself.

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:09.405
All you have to do is to program a mission

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:11.665
to tell the drone where to fly.

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:13.984
But you simply do that by clicking on

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:17.233
a few way points on the Google Maps interface

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.483
using the open-source software.

00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:21.430
Those missions could be as simple

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.456
as just a few way points,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:26.833
or they could be slightly longer
and more complicated,

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:29.254
to fly along a river system.

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:33.103
Sometimes, we fly the drone
in a lawnmower-type pattern
