Sometimes, we fly the drone
in a lawnmower-type pattern

00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:35.223
and take pictures of that area,

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:37.194
and those pictures can be processed

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.933
to produce a map of that forest.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:42.536
Other researchers might want to fly the drone

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.678
along the boundaries of a forest

00:03:44.678 --> 00:03:46.849
to watch out for poachers or people

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.767
who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:51.647
Now whatever your mission is,

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:53.120
once you've programmed it,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.103
you simply upload it to the autopilot system,

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.743
bring your drone to the field,

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.958
and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
