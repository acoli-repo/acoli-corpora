00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.032
and look at other things that might be happening

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:33.496
in the landscape.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:36.796
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:40.038
Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:41.560
in that part of the world,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.617
so we wanted to use this new drone technology

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:47.732
to keep track of the spread of these plantations

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:49.742
in Southeast Asia.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:52.105
But drones could also be used to keep track of

00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:54.589
illegal logging activities.

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.030
This is a recently logged forest,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.385
again in Sumatra.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.544
You could even still see the processed
