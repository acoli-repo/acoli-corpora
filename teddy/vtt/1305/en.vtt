I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and how it can be solved.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to start with a little experiment.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room
