00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's happening to the climate?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It is unbelievably bad.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is likely to be gone at this point

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we all look at what we can do.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
52 percent are tied to buildings.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we ran off to a sushi bar.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And it was something called EcoRock.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
gypsum drywall process that generates
