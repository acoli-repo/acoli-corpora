(Applause)

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.239
I respect her mother a lot, I love Tushar,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.879
I respect Ekta a lot, regard her

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.709
but am a fan only of Jeetendra Sahab.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.179
(Laughter)

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.230
Thank you for being here.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.120
Ekta really stands for our show's theme.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.799
That we have no right to tell anyone
what suits them, it’s their choice.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.134
If someone says something about you,
there is no need to listen to them

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.038
because it’s my choice.

00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:58.222
The lady who stands for:
"It's my choice."

00:08:58.072 --> 00:08:59.702
Give a hand for Ekta Kapoor.
Thank you so much.

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:03.712
