00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.559
but a person in a Chicago University
said in their research that,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.239
women got a chance to speak up in family
matters for the first time in India

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.120
This was because of TV.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.599
Marital rape. Domestic violence.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.239
Many such topics, even health care,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.079
we addressed these on TV when
social media did not even exist.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.270
I honestly think, TV has introduced
to the world and to us something:

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.810
the voice of women.
