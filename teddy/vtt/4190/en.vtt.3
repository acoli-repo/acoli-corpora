00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.159
I had friends who would become stars.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.559
All my friends were going to be stars,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.879
or had already got there.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.439
I did not want to be a star.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.000
The truth is that no
one would have made me a star.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.679
I was 80 kilos,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.279
and from my dad I had got
one thing: my Punjabi genes.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.359
I could not believe that one could go
to bed without eating butter chicken.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.320
People have a sweet tooth.
I had a complete sweet denture.
