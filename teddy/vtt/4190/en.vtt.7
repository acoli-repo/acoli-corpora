00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.319
A gold medalist has gold
within, not outside.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.879
A medal is made of artificial
gold, the real gold is inside.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.920
I would like her gold to be
inside, to be real.”

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.919
That night, I was so scared,
I was shivering, and I kept throwing up.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.519
I had ruined my father’s future.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.919
He was talking about gold.
I am hollow, totally hollow.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.760
Papa has bet on a lame horse!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.039
For the first time, I worked all night,
and then I continued working.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.799
I saw the pilot again and realized that
they were right, I had done a bad job.
