00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.799
I saw the pilot again and realized that
they were right, I had done a bad job.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.759
The second thing I learnt was that
one should not listen to other people.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.239
Do what you believe in.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.599
After working all night, I went
to the channel and left my pilot there.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.240
It got approved, and I got
a chance to make "Hum Paanch."

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.759
From there I got TV, and TV got me.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.379
People think I gave a lot to TV,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.519
but actually TV gave me a lot.
