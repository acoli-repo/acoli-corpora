00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.959
Life was good, but I had no plan B.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.759
I had no option.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.860
Sometimes your greatest curse turns
out to be your best blessing.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.280
I decided that I will start a
TV serial business.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.280
My dad invested in me.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.479
Now comes the twist in the plot.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.679
Your biggest twist happens
when you hit ground zero.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.999
The lowest point in your life.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.639
When you fall lower from a low.
