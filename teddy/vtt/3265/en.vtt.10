C: I need information
to determine the best approach.

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:05.386
DC: OK, a second choice.
Maybe we can learn something.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.563
What should we choose?

00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:07.758
Audience: Behavior.

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:09.335
DC: OK, deviant behavior, Vicky.

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:12.529
(Video) C: Do you know if it's been
behaving strangely before this?

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:15.631
Capt A: Listen ... saving that kid
is all that matters.

00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:19.809
DC: OK, we are not going to learn
anything from this guy.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:21.386
We need to do something.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.636
Let's try to go back in the lobby.

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:29.388
Oh, wait -- there's a room over there
on your right, Vicky, I think.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.420
Maybe there's something we can learn here.
