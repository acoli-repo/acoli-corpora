00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.810
Why aren't you sending a real person?

00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.334
DC: OK, she's not really happy.

00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:06.864
Her daughter's been
taken hostage by an android,

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:09.080
and of course, she's in a state of shock.

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.406
Now we can continue
to explore this apartment.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.108
We see all the SWAT forces in place.

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:16.248
But we need to find
this Captain Allen first.

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:18.053
That's the first thing we need to do.

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:20.769
So, again, we can go anywhere.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.948
Vicky's still in control of the character.

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:26.468
Let's see -- oh, I think this
is Captain Allen. He's on the phone.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:30.254
(Video) Connor: Captain Allen,
my name is Connor.
