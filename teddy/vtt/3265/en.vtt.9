(Video) Connor: Captain Allen,
my name is Connor.

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:32.284
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:37.658
Captain Allen: Let's fire
at everything that moves.

00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:39.470
It already shot down two of my men.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.211
We could easily get it,
but they're on the edge of the balcony --

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:44.420
it if falls,

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:45.649
she falls.

00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:48.943
DC: OK, now we need to decide
what we want to ask the captain.

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:50.211
What should be our choice?

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:52.818
Deviant's name? Deviant's
behavior? Emotional shock?

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.478
(Video) C: Has it experienced
an emotional shock recently?

00:04:57.222 --> 00:04:59.445
Capt A: I haven't got
a clue. Does it matter?

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.045
C: I need information
to determine the best approach.
