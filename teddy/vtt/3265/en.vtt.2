and as the audience,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.844
we can only watch, passively,

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:05.991
the consequences of his decisions.

00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:11.304
As a storyteller,
I've always been fascinated

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:17.133
with the idea of recreating
this notion of choices in fiction.

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:22.782
My dream was to put the audience
in the shoes of the main protagonists,

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:24.547
let them make their own decisions,

00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:28.838
and by doing so,
let them tell their own stories.
