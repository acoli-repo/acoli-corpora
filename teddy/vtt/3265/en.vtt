00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.559
The way we tell stories
has naturally changed

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.724
since Aristotle defined
the rules of tragedy

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:11.169
about 2,500 years ago.

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.296
According to him,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.991
the role of storytelling is to mimic life
and make us feel emotions.

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:23.525
And that's exactly what
storytelling as we know it

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:25.145
has done very well since then.

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:28.396
But there is a dimension of life

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:32.035
that storytelling could
never really reproduce.
