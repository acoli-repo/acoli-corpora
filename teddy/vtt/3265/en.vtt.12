many different consequences,

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:03.414
many different outcomes.

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:07.818
So that gives you an idea of what
my work is about as an interactive writer.

00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:12.167
Where a linear writer needs
to deal with time and space,

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:13.672
as an interactive writer,

00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:17.763
I need to deal with time,
space and possibilities.

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:23.083
I have to manage massive tree structures,

00:06:23.107 --> 00:06:26.477
where each branch
is a new variation of the story.

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.344
I need to think about all
the possibilities in a given scene

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:31.633
and try to imagine
everything that can happen.
