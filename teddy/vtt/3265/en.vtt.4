00:01:55.026 --> 00:02:00.730
I thought it would be a great opportunity
to do a little experiment.

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.379
I would like you, the people here at TED,

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.928
to tell your own story.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.687
So I came with an interactive scene
that we are going to play together.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.497
I've asked Vicky --

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:18.913
hello, Vicky --

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:21.411
to control the main character for us.

00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:24.640
And your role -- you, the audience --

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:28.278
will be to make the choices.

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.310
So Vicky and I don't know
what's going to happen,
