00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:32.800
With the emergence of new platforms
like interactive television,

00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:34.657
virtual reality and video games,

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:36.914
it can become a new form of entertainment

00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:40.574
and maybe even a new form of art.

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:44.130
I am convinced that in the coming years,

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:50.839
we will see more and more moving
and meaningful interactive experiences,

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:53.411
created by a new generation of talents.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.086
This is a medium
waiting for its Orson Welles

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.882
or its Stanley Kubrick,

00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:02.870
and I have no doubt
that they will soon emerge
