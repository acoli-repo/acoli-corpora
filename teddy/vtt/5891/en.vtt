Hey, Mark Leifer's, it's Adam. Season
four is launching this spring.

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.413
In the meantime, some exciting news.

00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:09.996
Each season we've done a couple of bonus
episodes where I have a discussion or

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:14.246
a debate with a thought leader. You asked
for more of those. So we've delivered.

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.496
This is a new series we're calling
taken for granted. Get it?

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:24.454
The gist, more unscripted conversations
with fascinating people about rethinking

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:25.913
things we've taken for granted.
