I sat down with a group
of Walmart workers and said,

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:05.845
"What do you think about this cashier,
this futuristic self-checkout thing?"

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.074
They said, "That's nice, but have
you heard about the cash recycler?

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.471
That's a machine that's being
installed right now,

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.132
and is eliminating two jobs
at every Walmart right now."

00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:17.199
And so we just thought, "Geez. We don't
understand the problem."

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:20.501
And so we looked at the voices
that were the ones that were excluded,

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:23.125
which is all of the people
affected by this change.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:24.736
And we decided to listen to them,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.744
sort of "automation and its discontents."

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.171
And I've spent the last
couple of years doing that.

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.591
I've been to Flint, Michigan,
and Youngstown, Ohio,
