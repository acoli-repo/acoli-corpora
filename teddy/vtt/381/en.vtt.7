The automation is right now,
the future is right now.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.014
BF: So what does that mean,
and what does that tell us?

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.736
If the future is now, what is it
that we should be doing,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.630
and what should we be thinking about?

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:39.734
RB: We have to understand
the problem first.

00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:45.966
and individual workers

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.252

If you look at the proportion
of prime working-age men,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.982

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:55.755
who work now versus in 1960,

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.247
we have three times
as many men not working.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.715
And then you hear the stories.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.178
I sat down with a group
of Walmart workers and said,
