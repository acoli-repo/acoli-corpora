00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.430
And I started making more money
than people who went to college."

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:33.628
Then they'd get to the end
of their thought and say something like,

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:36.297
"People need their fruits
and vegetables in the morning,

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.120
and I'm the guy who gets it to them."

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:41.684
We talked to somebody who, in addition
to his job, was caring for his aunt.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:43.207
He was making plenty of money.

00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:44.548
At one point we just asked,

00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:48.834
"What is it about caring for your aunt?
Can't you just pay somebody to do it?"

00:07:48.858 --> 00:07:51.351
He said, "My aunt doesn't want
somebody we pay for.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.577
My aunt wants me."

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:56.268
So there was this concept there
of being needed.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:58.749
If you study the word
"dignity," it's fascinating.

00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:02.048
It's one of the oldest words
in the English language, from antiquity.
