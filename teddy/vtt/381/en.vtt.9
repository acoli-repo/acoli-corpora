00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.591
I've been to Flint, Michigan,
and Youngstown, Ohio,

00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:34.046
talking about entrepreneurs,
trying to make it work

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.018
in a very different environment
from New York or San Francisco

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.527
or London or Tokyo.

00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:40.148
I've been to prisons twice

00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:43.053
to talk to inmates about
their jobs after they leave.

00:04:43.077 --> 00:04:46.824
I've sat down with truck drivers
to ask them about the self-driving truck,

00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:49.302
with people who, in addition
to their full-time job,

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:51.110
care for an aging relative.

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:52.698
And when you talk to people,

00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:55.673
there were two themes
that came out loud and clear.

00:04:56.285 --> 00:05:01.129
The first one was that people
are less looking for more money
