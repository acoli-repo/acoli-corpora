00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.514
And we just will think of it as work.

00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:02.212
The entire thing I'm trying to say

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:05.109
is that dignity should not
just be about having a job.

00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:07.990
Because if you say
you need a job to have dignity,

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:09.458
which many people say,

00:10:09.482 --> 00:10:12.299
the second you say that,
you say to all the parents

00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:14.768
and all the teachers
and all the caregivers

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:15.966
that all of a sudden,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.537
because they're not being paid
for what they're doing,

00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:20.854
it somehow lacks this
essential human quality.

00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:22.982
To me, that's the great
puzzle of our time:

00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:26.117
Can we figure out how to provide
that stability throughout life,

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:28.674
and then can we figure out
how to create an inclusive,

00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:32.965
not just racially, gender,
but multigenerationally inclusive --
