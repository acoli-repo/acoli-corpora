00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:30.634
And what we need is the experience
of needing one another

00:09:30.658 --> 00:09:32.283
and being connected to each other.

00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:35.347
Maybe that's the answer
for how we all fit as a society.

00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:37.093
And the thought exercise, to me, is:

00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:39.695
if you were to go back 100 years
and have people --

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:43.490
my grandparents, great-grandparents,
a tailor, worked in a mine --

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:47.339
they look at what all of us do
for a living and say, "That's not work."

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:51.132
We sit there and type and talk,
and there's no danger of getting hurt.

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:55.017
And my guess is that if you were
to imagine 100 years from now,

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:57.053
we'll still be doing things
for each other.

00:09:57.077 --> 00:09:58.483
We'll still need one another.

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.514
And we just will think of it as work.
