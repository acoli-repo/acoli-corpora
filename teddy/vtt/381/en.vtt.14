And again, if you survey people
and you ask them,

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.879
"How important is it to you
that your work be important to you?"

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:07.204
only people who make
150,000 dollars a year or more

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:11.451
say that it is important to them
that their work be important.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.275
BF: Meaning, meaningful?

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:16.621
RB: Just defined as,
"Is your work important to you?"

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.666
Whatever somebody took that to mean.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.604
And yet, of course dignity is essential.

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:23.348
We talked to truck drivers who said,

00:07:23.372 --> 00:07:27.336
"I saw my cousin drive, and I got
on the open road and it was amazing.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.430
And I started making more money
than people who went to college."
