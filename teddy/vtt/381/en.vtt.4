00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.603
the policy makers
were not speaking to them.

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:05.809
And so we partnered with a nonpartisan
think tank NGO called New America

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.166
to study this issue.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.538
And we brought together a group of people,

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.992
including an AI czar
at a technology company

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.888
and a video game designer

00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:16.395
and a heartland conservative

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.663
and a Wall Street investor

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:19.647
and a socialist magazine editor --

00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.639
literally, all in the same room;
it was occasionally awkward --

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:25.244
to try to figure out
what is it that will happen here.

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:28.088
The question we asked was simple.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.117
It was: What is the effect of technology
on work going to be?
