00:04:56.285 --> 00:05:01.129
The first one was that people
are less looking for more money

00:05:01.153 --> 00:05:04.431
or get out of the fear
of the robot taking their job,

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:06.351
and they just want something stable.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.915
They want something predictable.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.614
So if you survey people and ask them
what they want out of work,

00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:15.118
for everybody who makes
less than 150,000 dollars a year,

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:18.498
they'll take a more stable
and secure income, on average,

00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:20.387
over earning more money.

00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.625
And if you think about the fact that

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:26.037
not only for all of the people
across the earth who don't earn a living,

00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:27.252
but for those who do,

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.236
the vast majority earn a different
amount from month to month
