00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:31.839
And my point of view
after talking to people

00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:33.903
is that we may do that,

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.507
and it still might not be enough.

00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:38.338
Because what we need to do
from the beginning is understand

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:40.602
what is it about work
that gives people dignity,

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:43.966
so they can live the lives
that they want to live.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.005
And so that concept of dignity is ...

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.961
it's difficult to get your hands around,

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:53.584
because when many people hear it --
especially, to be honest, rich people --

00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:54.764
they hear "meaning."

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:56.694
They hear "My work is important to me."

00:06:56.718 --> 00:07:00.355
And again, if you survey people
and you ask them,
