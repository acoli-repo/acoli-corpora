00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.117
It was: What is the effect of technology
on work going to be?

00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:33.768
And we looked out 10 to 20 years,

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:37.276
because we wanted to look out far enough
that there could be real change,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.269
but soon enough that we weren't talking
about teleportation or anything like that.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:42.671
And we recognized --

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.744
and I think every year
we're reminded of this in the world --

00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:47.975
that predicting what's
going to happen is hard.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.855
So instead of predicting,
there are other things you can do.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.675
You can try to imagine
alternate possible futures,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:54.851
which is what we did.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.633
We did a scenario-planning exercise,

00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:59.723
and we imagined cases
where no job is safe.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:02.850
We imagined cases where every job is safe.
