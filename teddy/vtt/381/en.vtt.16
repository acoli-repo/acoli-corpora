00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:02.048
It's one of the oldest words
in the English language, from antiquity.

00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:03.224
And it has two meanings:

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:04.402
one is self-worth,

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:08.653
and the other is that something
is suitable, it's fitting,

00:08:08.677 --> 00:08:11.535
meaning that you're part
of something greater than yourself,

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:13.382
and it connects to some broader whole.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:15.123
In other words, that you're needed.

00:08:15.147 --> 00:08:17.021
BF: So how do you answer this question,

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:19.095
this concept that we don't pay teachers,

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.387
and we don't pay eldercare workers,

00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:24.537
and we don't pay people
who really care for people

00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.847
and are needed, enough?

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:30.053
RB: Well, the good news is,
people are finally asking the question.
