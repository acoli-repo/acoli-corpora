00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:31.244
And it was a frustrating experience,

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:35.283
because I'd hear the same back-and-forth
over and over again:

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:37.085
"The robots are coming!"

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.712
And then somebody else would say,

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:42.300
"Oh, don't worry about that, they've
always said that and it turns out OK."

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:43.713
Then somebody else would say,

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.469
"Well, it's really about the meaning
of your job, anyway."

00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:49.276
And then everybody would shrug
and go off and have a drink.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.402
And it felt like there was this
Kabuki theater of this discussion,

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.301
where nobody was talking to each other.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:57.811
And many of the people that I knew
and worked with in the technology world

00:01:57.835 --> 00:01:59.510
were not speaking to policy makers;

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.603
the policy makers
were not speaking to them.
