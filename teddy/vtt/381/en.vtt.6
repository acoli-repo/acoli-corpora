00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:02.850
We imagined cases where every job is safe.

00:03:02.874 --> 00:03:06.913
And we imagined every
distinct possibility we could.

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.220
And the result, which really surprised us,

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:13.942
was when you think through those futures
and you think what should we do,

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:17.881
the answers about what we should do
actually turn out to be the same,

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:19.401
no matter what happens.

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:23.167
And the irony of looking out
10 to 20 years into the future is,

00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:25.600
you realize that the things
we want to act on

00:03:25.624 --> 00:03:27.585
are actually already happening right now.

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.395
The automation is right now,
the future is right now.
