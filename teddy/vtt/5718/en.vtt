00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:03.079
I work at the United Nations.

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:04.704
And for the past couple of years,

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.996
I have served as the head
of the UN's Development Programme.

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:10.954
When I first walked
into the UN headquarters

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.496
in New York City, many years ago,

00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:17.663
the first thing I noticed
was a sculpture standing outside

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:20.163
under the flags
of the nations of the world.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:22.413
It's called the Knotted Gun.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.579
And it still stands there today.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.288
To me, that sculpture symbolizes

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.746
exactly what the UN was created
to do 75 years ago:
