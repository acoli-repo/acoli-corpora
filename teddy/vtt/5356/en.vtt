Chris Anderson: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.706 --> 00:00:03.722
Welcome to the TED Interview.

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:05.495
This is Chris Anderson,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.466
the guy lucky enough to run TED.

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:12.537
Here at TED, we're borderline obsessed
with the power of ideas.

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.157
Ideas are such weird things.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.451
They get inside your head,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:18.156
and they might just give you
a little piece of knowledge,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.049
or they might actually really reshape
how you see the world.

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:22.882
They can even change who you are.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.455
They're this powerful common currency

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.733
that humans have and can
share with each other.

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:31.054
Now, we normally share them
in the form of TED Talks,
