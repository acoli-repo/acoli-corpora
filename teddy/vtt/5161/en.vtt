Grace Song: I'm one of those people
that feel responsible

00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:05.226
for other people's feelings,
which is terrible.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.268
(Laughs)

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:10.393
And I just made up
all these things in my head

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:13.976

if I would ask for things.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.143
So I'm a people-pleaser.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.143
(Laughs)

Adam Grant: This is Grace Song.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.393
Her drive to make others happy

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:23.684

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:26.809
but it's also occasionally
made her a little timid.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.101
GS: (Laughs)

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.143
I was a person where I'd go into shops
