00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:33.142
and he really took that challenge
and broke it down to three principles

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.838
that I think can be applied
in nearly any design problem.

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:37.013
First one is focus.

00:02:37.143 --> 00:02:39.143
Focus on who you're doing this for.

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.501
The second principle is simplicity.

00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:44.381
What's the shortest way
to deliver that need?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.313
Finally, the last thing is:

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.541
Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way.

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:51.435
Who would've thought
that an electrical engineer

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.779
would be the person to hold the key

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.873
to unlock what was then one of the most
complicated systems in the world --

00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:00.790
all started by one guy
with a pencil and an idea.
