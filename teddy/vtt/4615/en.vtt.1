00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.162
The map they made is complicated.

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:35.138
You can see rivers,
bodies of water, trees and parks --

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.221
the stations were all crammed together
at the center of the map,

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:41.846
and out in the periphery, there were some
that couldn't even fit on the map.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.042
So the map was geographically accurate,
but maybe not so useful.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.484
Enter Harry Beck.

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.360
Harry Beck was a 29-year-old
engineering draftsman

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.176
who had been working on and off
for the London Underground.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.445
And he had a key insight,

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.097
and that was that people
riding underground in trains

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.787
don't really care
what's happening aboveground.
