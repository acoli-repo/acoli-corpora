00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:30.223
and he's fixed it all
so that it's not really a map anymore.

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:32.144
What it is is a diagram,

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.403
just like circuitry,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.120
except the circuitry here
isn't wires conducting electrons,

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:41.486
it's tubes containing trains
conducting people from place to place.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:47.152
In 1933, the Underground decided, at last,
to give Harry Beck's map a try.

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:50.612
The Underground did a test run
of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size.

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:51.993
They were gone in one hour.

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:53.930
They realized they were onto something,

00:01:53.954 --> 00:01:56.446
they printed 750,000 more,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.909
and this is the map that you see today.

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.435
Beck's design really became the template
