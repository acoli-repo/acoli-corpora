Beck's design really became the template

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.907
for the way we think of metro maps today.

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.765
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, São Paulo,
Sydney, Washington, D.C. --

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.363
all of them convert complex geography

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:13.055
into crisp geometry.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.516
All of them use different colors
to distinguish between lines,

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:20.688
all of them use simple symbols
to distinguish between types of stations.

They all are part
of a universal language, seemingly.

00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:27.498
I bet Harry Beck wouldn't have known
what a user interface was,

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:29.779
but that's really what he designed

00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:33.142
and he really took that challenge
and broke it down to three principles
