The history of civilization,
in some ways, is a history of maps:

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.984
How have we come to understand
the world around us?

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:11.264
One of the most famous maps works
because it really isn't a map at all.

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:13.991
[Small thing. Big idea.]

The London Underground
came together in 1908,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.337
when eight different
independent railways merged

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.080
to create a single system.

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:27.335
They needed a map to represent that system

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.081
so people would know where to ride.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:32.162
The map they made is complicated.
