00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.787
don't really care
what's happening aboveground.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.296
They just want to get
from station to station --

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.304
"Where do I get on? Where do I get off?"

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:09.066
It's the system that's important,
not the geography.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.978
He's taken this complicated
mess of spaghetti,

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.485
and he's simplified it.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.753
The lines only go in three directions:

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:19.097
they're horizontal, they're vertical,
or they're 45 degrees.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.089
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally,

00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:26.049
he's made every station color
correspond to the color of the line,

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:30.223
and he's fixed it all
so that it's not really a map anymore.
