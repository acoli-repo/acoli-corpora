that transcend the author’s prejudices.

Despite his literary legacy,

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.215
Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:13.041
He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46–

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.044
a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference.

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.271
But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels,

00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:21.912
tabletop games, and cultural icons.

00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:25.559
And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future,

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:30.249
Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.
