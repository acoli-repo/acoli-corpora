His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.021
In "The Colour out of Space,"

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.679

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:12.825
Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:17.239
"At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:20.289

In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror,

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.187

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:29.396
wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them.

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:32.910
Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays,
