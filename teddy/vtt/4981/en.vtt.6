00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:01.579
the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference–

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.599
the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.420
at the mercy of unfathomable forces.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.808
But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had

00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:12.483
was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries.

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:13.880
During his lifetime,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.159
Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers,

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.105
encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own.

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:24.574
References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:26.870
can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.144
such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch.
