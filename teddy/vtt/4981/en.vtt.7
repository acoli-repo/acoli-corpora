00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.144
such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:33.874
Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos,

00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:38.216
named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.267
Unfortunately,

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:42.392
Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.006
in his personal views.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.099
The author held strong racist views,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.763
and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:53.471
But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices.

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.127
And after Lovecraft’s death,

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:58.883
the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors,

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:01.543
often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives
