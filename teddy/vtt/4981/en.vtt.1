Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890,

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:35.444
Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories

00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:38.668
written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers.

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.401
But by the time he began writing in 1917,

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.044
World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.075
People had seen real horrors,

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.342
and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.077
Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:57.075
one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.633
His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility.
