00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:32.910
Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.515
the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful,

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:38.638
yet often invisible and indescribable.

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:43.263
Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks,

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:47.827
the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed–

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:51.780
but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.399
Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.051
often take place in the same 
fictional continuity,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.583
with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies.
