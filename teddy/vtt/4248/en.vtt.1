00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.126
And the idea is a simple, simple idea,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.230
which is the fact that the consumer
has moved from a state of anxiety

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:36.412
to action.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.675
Consumers who represent 72 percent
of the GDP of America

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.143
have actually started, just like banks
and just like businesses,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.251
to de-leverage, to unwind
their leverage in daily life,

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.226
to remove themselves
from the liability and risk

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.126
that presents itself as they move forward.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.883
So, to understand this --
and I'm going to stress this --

00:00:56.907 --> 00:00:59.070
it's not about the consumer
being in retreat.

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:00.454
The consumer is empowered.
