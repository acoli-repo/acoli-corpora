00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.008
That includes cottages and the like,

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:01.200
but 30 percent.

00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:04.236
People are getting their hands dirty,
rolling up their sleeves.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.427
They want these skills.

00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:09.015
We see it with the phenomenon of raising
backyard hens, chickens and ducks.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.727
And when you work out the math,
they say it doesn't work,

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.051
but the principle is there;

00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.790
it's about being sustainable
and taking care of yourself.

00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:18.425
Then we look at the High Line
in New York City,

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.217
an excellent use of reimagining
existing infrastructure

00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.400
for something good,

00:11:22.424 --> 00:11:24.459
which is a brand-new park
in New York City.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:28.574
So what brands can do, and companies,
is pay dividends to consumers,

00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:30.126
be a brand that lasts,
