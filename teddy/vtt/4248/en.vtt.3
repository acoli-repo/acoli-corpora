00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:30.567
We have national debt, Detroit,
currency valuations, health care --

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.888
all these issues facing us.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:34.638
You put them all together,
mix them up in a bouillabaisse,

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.993
and you have consumer confidence
that's basically a ticking time bomb.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.994
In fact, let's go back and look
at what caused this crisis,

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:43.496
because the consumer,
all of us, in our daily lives,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.996
actually contributed
a large part to the problem.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.800
This is something I call
the 50-20 paradox.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.576
It took us 50 years

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.356
to reach annual savings ratings
of almost 10 percent.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.576
Fifty years.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.478
Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:01.316
Do you know why savings was so high?
