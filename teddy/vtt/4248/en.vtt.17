00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.901
The second of the four values
is this movement toward

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.230
ethics and fair play.

00:08:33.254 --> 00:08:36.391
We see that play itself out

lots of really hopeful things
come out of this recession.

00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:53.295
I'll give you a few examples.

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:55.844
One is the rise toward communities
and neighborhoods,

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:59.582
and increased emphasis on your neighbors
as your support system.

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:03.653
Also, a wonderful by-product
of a really lousy thing,
