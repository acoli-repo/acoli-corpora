00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:01.180
all of their expense reports
are put onto their company intranet

00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:02.383
for everyone to see.

00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:04.126
Complete transparency.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.426
Think twice before you have
that bottle of wine.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.507
(Laughter)

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:10.304
The third of the four laws
of post-crisis consumerism

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:11.813
is about durable living.

00:10:11.837 --> 00:10:14.374
We're seeing in our data
that consumers are realizing

00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:16.126
this is a marathon, not a sprint.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.009
They're digging in and looking
for ways to extract value

00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:21.126
out of every purchase they make.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.065
Witness the fact that Americans
are holding on to their cars

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:27.951
longer than ever before:
9.4 years on average, in March.

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:29.126
A record.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.126
We also see the fact that libraries
have become a huge resource for America.
