00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.220
(Laughter)

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:32.640
So, from a value and values standpoint,

00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:35.617
what companies can do is connect
in lots of different ways.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.533
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:41.395
They are actually vowing to retrain
two million Americans with IT training,

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:44.521
using their existing infrastructure
to do something good.

00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:47.006
Also, a really interesting
company is GORE-TEX.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.740
GORE-TEX is all about
personal accountability

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:51.713
of their management and their employees,

00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:55.295
to the point where they really
kind of shun the idea of bosses.

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:58.084
But they also talk about the fact
that their executives --

00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:01.180
all of their expense reports
are put onto their company intranet
