00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:31.611
And then we also see this movement
forward from dollars and cents.

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.350
What businesses can do to connect
with these new mindsets

00:07:34.374 --> 00:07:35.541
is really interesting.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:37.410
A couple things that are kind of cool.

00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:41.127
One is that Frito-Lay figured out
this liquidity thing with their consumer.

00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.554
They found their consumer had more

00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:45.987
less at the end of the month.

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.024

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:50.070
larger packs at the beginning
of the month,

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.114
smaller packaging at the end of the month.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.857
Really interestingly, too,
was the San Francisco Giants.

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.126
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.369
It takes into account everything
from the pitcher match-ups,
