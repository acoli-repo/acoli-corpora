There was nothing to buy,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.788
we went from a 10 percent savings rate
to a negative savings rate.

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.465
Because we binged.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.282

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:34.154
The personal debt-to-income ratio
basically went from 65 to 135 percent
