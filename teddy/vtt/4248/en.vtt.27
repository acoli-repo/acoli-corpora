00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.345
which is the whole phenomenon
of consumers organizing together

00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:35.262
to buy meat from organic farms,
that they know is safe and controlled

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:37.472
in the way that they want it
to be controlled.

00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:41.063
And then there's this other really
interesting movement in California,

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:42.570
which is about carrot mobs.

00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:45.640
The traditional thing would be
to boycott, right? Have a stick.

00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:47.010
Well, why not have a carrot?

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:50.338
So these are consumers organizing,
pooling their resources

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:53.126
to incentify companies to do good.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.947
And then we look at what companies can do.

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:59.424
This is all the opportunity
about being a community organizer.

00:13:59.448 --> 00:14:02.415
You have to realize
that you can't fight and control this.
