00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.512
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:34.471
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea
that spending money frivolously

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.233
makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.

00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:39.746
The management principle
is dollars and cents.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.614
So let's look at some examples
of this déclassé consumption

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:44.066
that falls out of this value.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.387
The first thing is,
something must be happening

00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:48.487
when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:49.525
(Laughter)

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:51.891
But seriously, we also have
this phenomenon

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.840
on Madison Avenue and in other places,

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:56.787
where people are actually
walking out of luxury boutiques

00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.624
with ordinary, generic paper bags
to hide the brand purchases.
