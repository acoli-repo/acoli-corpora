00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:32.993
we are stacking ourselves up
for long-term leverage.

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:35.669
However, consumers have moved.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.732
They are taking responsibility.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:40.285
What we're seeing
is an uptake in the savings rate.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.024
In fact, 11 straight months
of savings have happened

00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:44.695
since the beginning of the crisis.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.083
We're working our way back up
to that 10 percent.

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:49.037
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.442
spending dropped
to its lowest level in 62 years --

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.126
almost a 3.7 percent decline.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.030
Visa now reports that more people
are using debit cards than credit cards.

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:02.447
So we're starting to pay for things
with money that we have.
