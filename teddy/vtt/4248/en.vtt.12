00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:02.359
we set out to understand
what's been happening in the crisis

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:03.924
with the consumer marketplace.

00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:06.165
We found a couple
of really interesting things.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.616
We're going to go
through four value shifts

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.976
that we see driving
new consumer behaviors,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.057
that offer new management principles.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.891
The first cultural value shift we see

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.541
is this tendency toward something
we call "liquid life."

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:18.715
This is the movement

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.820
from Americans defining
their success on having things

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.126
to having liquidity,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.842
because the less excess
that you have around you,

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.018
the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.512
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
