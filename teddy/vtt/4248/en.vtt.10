00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.606
hopefully not related
to the former point I just made,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.093
which is that shark attacks
are at their lowest level from 2003.

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.638
Does anybody know why?

00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.193
(Laughter)

00:05:07.217 --> 00:05:08.385
No one's at the beach.

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.305
So there's a bright side to everything.

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:12.515
But seriously, what we see happening,

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.457
for the consumer who drove us
into this recession

00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:22.006
to lead us right back out.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.372
What I mean by that is we can
move from mindless consumption

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:27.424
to mindful consumption.

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:28.608
Right?

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:29.707
(Applause)

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.763
If you think about the last three decades,
