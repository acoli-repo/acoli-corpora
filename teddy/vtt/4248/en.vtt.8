00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:02.447
So we're starting to pay for things
with money that we have.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.126
And we're starting to be much more careful
about how we save and invest.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.126
But that's not really the whole story,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.067
because this has also been a dramatic
time of transformation.

00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.717
And you've got to admit,
over the last year and a half,

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.809
consumers have been doing
some weird things.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.124
It's pretty staggering,
what we've lived through.

00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:20.844
If you take into account
that 80 percent of all Americans

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:22.264
were born after World War II,

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.021
this was essentially our Depression.

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:26.850
And so, as a result,
some crazy things have happened.

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:28.224
I'll give you some examples.

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.913
Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,
guns and shark attacks.
