00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:03.653
Also, a wonderful by-product
of a really lousy thing,

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.045
which has been unemployment,

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.870
is a rise in volunteerism
that's been noted in our country.

00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:11.564
We also see the phenomenon --
some of you may have "boomerang kids" --

00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:13.225
these are "boomerang alumni,"

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:15.982
where universities are actually
reconnecting with alumni

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:18.787
and helping them with jobs,
sharing skills and retraining.

00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.359
We also talked about character
and professionalism.

00:09:21.383 --> 00:09:25.126
We had this miracle on the Hudson
in New York City in January,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.126
and suddenly Sully has become
a key name on BabyCenter.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.220
