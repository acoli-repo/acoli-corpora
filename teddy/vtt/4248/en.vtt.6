00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:01.606
So if you look at this in the context
of visualizing the bailout,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.126
what you can see is,
if you stack up dollar bills,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.392
first of all, 360,000 dollars

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.935
is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.236
But if you stack it up, you see
this amazing, staggering amount of dollars

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.126
that have been put into the system
to fund and bail us out.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.315
So this is the first 315 billion.

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.112
But I read this fact the other day,

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:23.446
that one trillion seconds
equals 32,000 years.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.787
So if you think about that,

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.307
the context, the casualness
with which we talk about

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.584
trillion-dollar bailout here
and trillion there,

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:32.993
we are stacking ourselves up
for long-term leverage.
