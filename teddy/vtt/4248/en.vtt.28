You have to realize
that you can't fight and control this.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:04.049
You actually need to organize it.

00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:06.598
You need to harness it.
You need to give it meaning.

00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:09.834
And there's lots of really
interesting examples here.

00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:14.651
First is just the rise of the fact
that Zagat's has actually moved out of

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:16.903
and diversified from rating restaurants,

00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:19.126
into actually rating health care.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.279
So what credentials does Zagat's have?

00:14:21.303 --> 00:14:22.473
Well, they have a lot,

00:14:22.497 --> 00:14:24.341
because it's their network of people.

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:26.908
So that becomes
a very powerful force for them

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.126
to make their brand more elastic.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.407
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
