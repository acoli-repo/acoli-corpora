00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.913
Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,
guns and shark attacks.

00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:34.725
(Laughter)

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.632
Dentists report molars --
people grinding their teeth,

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.019
coming in and reporting
that they've had stress.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:44.465
So there's an increase in people
having to have their fillings replaced.

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:47.783
Gun sales, according to the FBI,
who does background checks,

00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:50.901
are up almost 25 percent since January.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:55.578
Vasectomies are up 48 percent,
according to the Cornell Institute.

00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:58.006
And lastly, but a very good point,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.606
hopefully not related
to the former point I just made,
