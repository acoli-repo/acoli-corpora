00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.369
It takes into account everything
from the pitcher match-ups,

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:02.236
to the weather, to the team records,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.664
in setting prices for the consumer.

00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:09.719
Another quick example of these types
of movements is the rise of Zynga.

00:08:09.743 --> 00:08:12.023
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire

00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:14.059
to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:16.843
Again, this theme is about variable
cost, variable living.

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:18.739
So micro-payments have become huge.

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:21.342
And lastly, some people are using Hulu

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.438
as a device to get rid
of their cable bill.

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:27.052
So, really clever ideas there
that are being taken ahold of

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:29.247
and that marketers
are starting to understand.

00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.901
The second of the four values
is this movement toward
