This, plus the fact that you've got
phenomenal work from CEOs,

00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:06.691
from Ford to Zappos,
connecting on Twitter,

00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:08.126
creating an open environment,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.188
allowing their employees
to be part of the process,

00:15:11.212 --> 00:15:12.920
rather than hidden behind walls.

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:17.149
You see this rising force
in total transparency and openness

00:15:17.173 --> 00:15:18.961
that companies are starting to adopt,

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.292
all because the consumer is demanding it.

00:15:21.316 --> 00:15:23.262
So when we look at this and step back,

00:15:23.286 --> 00:15:27.478
what I believe is that the crisis
that exists today is definitely real.

00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:30.126
It's been tremendously
powerful for consumers.
