WEBVTT

00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:30.126
be a brand that lasts,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.539
offer transparency,

00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:34.057
promise you're going to be there
beyond today's sale.

00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:36.126
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.864
Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"

00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:41.686
basically goes through and tracks
every product they make,

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.500
and gives you social responsibility,

00:11:43.524 --> 00:11:47.063
and helps you understand the ethics
behind the product they make.

00:11:47.087 --> 00:11:48.869
Another great example is Fidelity.

00:11:48.893 --> 00:11:52.579
Rather than instant cash-back rewards
on your credit or debit purchases,

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:57.499
this is about 529 rewards
for your student education.

00:11:57.523 --> 00:11:59.610
Or the interesting company Sunrun.

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:00.789
I love this company.
