Without having to prick your skin
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:05.127 --> 00:05:11.835
this patch can spot, isolate and track
a heart-attack specific biomarker

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:13.940
called H-FABP,

00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:19.626
and alerts you if and when it reaches
a critical level in your bloodstream --

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.319
a process that's much simpler, easier
and cheaper than conventional methods

00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:27.530
of heart-attack diagnosis.

00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:32.647
By checking on biomarker
concentration data,
