My grandfather
was an at-risk patient, too.

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:38.841
I probed this issue further --

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.706
read as much as I could
to understand the heart,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.419
met researchers
and worked across labs in India.

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:50.704
And finally, after three long years
of persistent research,

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:54.727
what I have to share with the world today
is a promising solution.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.379
A noninvasive device that is inexpensive,

00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:04.895
portable, wearable by at-risk
patients at all times.
