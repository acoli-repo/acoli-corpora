My device solely relies on this data.

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:37.306
The key is that these cardiac
biomarkers are found

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.103
in one of the earliest
stages of a heart attack,

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:43.638
when someone is almost sure to survive

00:04:43.662 --> 00:04:46.802
if he or she gets prompt care.

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:51.625
And my device is solely based
on that basis.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.441
And here's how my device works.
