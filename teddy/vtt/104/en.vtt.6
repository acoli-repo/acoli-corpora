portable, wearable by at-risk
patients at all times.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:08.687
It greatly reduces
the need for a blood test

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:14.700
and works 24/7, collecting
and analyzing data at preset intervals.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:19.052
And all this data is collected
for a single purpose:

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.727
detecting heart attacks as they occur.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:27.933
This is a very promising solution
that might help us in the future.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:32.381
