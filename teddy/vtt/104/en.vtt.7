You may not know how intelligent
your heart really is.

00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:38.443
It tries to communicate to your body
multiple times before failing,

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.929
by indicating symptoms like chest pain.

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:45.600
These symptoms are triggered
when the heart loses out

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.752
on oxygen-rich blood flow.

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:51.261
But remember I told you
about the nerve damage.

00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:55.967
It silences these symptoms
before a silent heart attack,

00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:59.540
which makes it even deadlier.
