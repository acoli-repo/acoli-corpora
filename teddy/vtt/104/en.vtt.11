00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:32.647
By checking on biomarker
concentration data,

00:05:33.742 --> 00:05:37.838
a system like this,
with advanced research in the future,

00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:42.294
could significantly reduce the need
for an at-risk patient to go to a doctor

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:43.656
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.014
because the device
could be worn at all times,

00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:50.171
sensing biomarker elevations in real time.

00:05:51.313 --> 00:05:56.520
Thus, if the device senses the biomarker
levels going beyond the critical point,

00:05:56.544 --> 00:06:01.025
the at-risk patient could be warned
of an impending cardiac arrest
