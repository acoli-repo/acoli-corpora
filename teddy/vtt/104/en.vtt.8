And you may not even know
the common symptoms.

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:10.116
Meanwhile, the heart also sends out
certain biomarkers --

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.313
cardiac biomarkers or proteins
that are SOS messages --

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:17.139
in the form of SOS messages --

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:18.742
into your bloodstream,

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.381
indicating that the heart is at risk.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.084
As it gets riskier and riskier,

00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:27.688
the concentrations
of these cardiac biomarker proteins

00:04:27.712 --> 00:04:29.612
keep increasing abysmally.
