00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.922
but there is a type of heart attack
that is quite common,

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:05.415
just as deadly,

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.174
but harder to detect
because the symptoms are silent.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.054
People having silent heart attacks
just don't realize what's happening,

00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:18.973
so they're not seeking medical attention,

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:23.922
which means they're less likely
to receive the treatment that they need

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.399
at the critical moment.

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:29.797
And even if they do
get to the hospital by chance,

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.557
either before or after
they are struck by a heart attack,
