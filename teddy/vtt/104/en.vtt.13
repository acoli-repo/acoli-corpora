Consequently, they don't have to go

00:06:33.148 --> 00:06:36.442
for expensive and invasive
medical treatments

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:39.358
that would otherwise be necessary
after a heart attack.

00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:44.611
When I got my device tested
on at-risk patients under observation,

00:06:44.635 --> 00:06:47.620
results from the clinical validation tests

00:06:47.644 --> 00:06:51.744
certified close to a 96 percent
accuracy and sensitivity.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.173
I intend to make my device available
to people in two variants:

00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:01.221
one which gives digital analysis
of the biomarker levels
