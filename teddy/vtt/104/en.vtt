When I was 13,

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:05.467
I lost my grandfather
to a silent heart attack.

00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:10.366
What happened to be more
shocking was that at 75,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.848
grandpa was really normal,
healthy and energetic,

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.132
but he was diabetic.

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.465
Learning all of this was so painful

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.499
that I decided to go out on a war
against this deadly killer

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:25.999
and see what could be done.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.429
It was shocking to discover
the results of recent studies
