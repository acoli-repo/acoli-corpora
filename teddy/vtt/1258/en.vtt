00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I told you three things last year.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I told you that the statistics of the world

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have not been made properly available.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Because of that, we still have the old mindset

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that animated graphics can make a difference.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Things are changing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Applause)
