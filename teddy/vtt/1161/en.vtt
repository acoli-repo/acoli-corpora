Trees epitomize stasis.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for many human generations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but if we shift our perspective

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the trunk to the twigs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
trees become very dynamic entities,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
moving and growing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I decided to explore this movement

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by turning trees into artists.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that produced art.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
