00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.893
I'm here to honor the sacredness of life

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:08.268
that I see at the border in south Texas.

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:10.768
In 2014,

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.559
I visited a detention facility

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:17.768
where hundreds of little children,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.101
immigrant children,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.684
were detained for several weeks

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.309
in conditions that were
very heartbreaking.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.101
They were dirty and muddy

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.375
and crying.
