00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.625
"Please, help me."

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.018
It was so difficult to be there with them.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.851
I started to cry with them,

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.792
and I told them,

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:10.934
"Let us pray."

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.768
(Spanish) "Vamos a rezar."

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.583
And they repeated after me,

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.226
(Spanish) "Diosito, ayúdanos."

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.375
"God, please, help us."

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:25.143
As we prayed, I could see
the Border Patrol officers

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.250
looking through a glass window.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.625
They were at the verge of tears.
