00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:02.351
"Showers?"

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.458
Sure enough, that evening
we had a mobile unit of eight showers.

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:08.809
Amazing.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.101
And after that,

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:13.726
we had 100 percent support
of the city government.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.059
We were there,

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:17.893
wanting to make sure that we were helping

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.809
and be successful with our response

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.143
to so many families that we were seeing

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.018
every single day.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:28.309
I think that we must help others see

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.226
what we see.
