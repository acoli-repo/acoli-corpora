00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.292
when we can understand
what they're hurting.

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:03.583
To really meet up with them.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:07.309
It is then that we are present to them

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:10.143
and we can make their humanity

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.601
a part of our own humanity.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.268
And we'd recognize

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:17.250
that we are all part
of the same human family.

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.101
During those days,

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:23.559
I had a lady approach me and tell me,

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:28.559
"Sister, I am 100 percent
against what you do,

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.809
helping these illegal aliens."
