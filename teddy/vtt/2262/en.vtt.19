00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:32.351
that we must make sure
who enters our country,

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.458
that criminals should be put away.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.809
But it is also true

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:42.809
that we must not lose
our humanity in doing this.

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:45.351
That we must have policies and procedures

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.559
that do not contribute
to the human suffering

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:51.268
that people are already suffering.

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:56.018
And that we can find solutions
that are respectful to all human life.

00:09:56.042 --> 00:09:57.434
We can do this,

00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:00.726
if we can allow the best
in us to come out.
