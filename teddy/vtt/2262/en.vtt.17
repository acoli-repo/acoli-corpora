00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.893
They're good people

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:35.643
who are entering our country
and coming to the United States

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:38.518
only simply because they're fleeing
away from violence

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:39.917
and they want to be safe.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:45.018
Unfortunately, what we see at the border

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:46.851
is terrible.

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:49.434
People are hurting and suffering.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:50.917
Thousands of them are.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.268
And mostly I feel

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.976
it's because of those walls
that we put up,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.351
that we have in our hearts,

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.518
that makes us not care.
