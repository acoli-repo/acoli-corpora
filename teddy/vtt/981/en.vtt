00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:03.340
What is so special about the human brain?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.552
Why is it that we study other animals

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:07.673
instead of them studying us?

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.471
What does a human brain have or do

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:11.204
that no other brain does?

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:14.052
When I became interested
in these questions about 10 years ago,

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.994
scientists thought they knew
what different brains were made of.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.723
Though it was based on very little evidence,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:20.910
many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.635
including the human brain,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.935
were made in the same way,

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:25.437
with a number of neurons that was always

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.668
proportional to the size of the brain.

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:29.744
This means that two brains of the same size,

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:33.292
like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,
