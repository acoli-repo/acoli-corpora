You know who I'm envious of?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.456
People who work in a job
that has to do with their college major.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.376
(Laughter)

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.976
Journalists who studied journalism,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.960
engineers who studied engineering.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.335
The truth is, these folks
are no longer the rule,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.616
but the exception.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.816
A 2010 study found that
only a quarter of college graduates

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.080
work in a field
that relates to their degree.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.920
I graduated with not one
but two degrees in biology.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.536
To my parents' dismay,
I am neither a doctor nor a scientist.
