00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.056
I cofounded a hiring platform
called Headlight,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.720
which gives candidates
an opportunity to shine.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.216
Just as teams have tryouts
and plays have auditions,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.816
candidates should be asked
to demonstrate their skills

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.256
before they're hired.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.656
Our clients are benefiting
from 85 years of employment research,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.256
which shows that work samples

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.840
are one of the best predictors
of success on the job.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.376
If you're hiring a data analyst,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.136
give them a spreadsheet of historical data
and ask them for their key insights.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.976
If you're hiring a marketing manager,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.416
have them plan a launch campaign
for a new product.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.616
And if you're a candidate,
don't wait for an employer to ask.
