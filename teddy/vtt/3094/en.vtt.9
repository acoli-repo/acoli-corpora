00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.320
I was almost put on
a special needs track as a child.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.736
A month into kindergarten,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.376

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.296

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.440

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.776
As recent immigrants,
we lived in the attic
