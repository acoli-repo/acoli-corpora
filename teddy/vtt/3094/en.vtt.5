00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.560
but here are three ideas to take forward.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.840
One: expand your search.

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:39.136
If we only look for talent
in the same places we always do --

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.416
gifted child programs, Ivy League schools,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.336
prestigious organizations --

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.976
we're going to get
the same results we always have.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.696
Baseball was transformed
when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.096
started recruiting players
who didn't score highly

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.696
on traditionally valued metrics,
like runs batted in,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.776
but who had the ability
to help the team score points

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.000
and win games.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.640
This idea is taking hold
outside of sports.
