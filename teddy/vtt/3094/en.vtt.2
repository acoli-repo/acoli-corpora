00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.056
The company had recently gone public,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.856
so as part of my job application,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.456
I read the IPO filings from cover to cover

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.176
and built a website from scratch
which included my analysis of the business

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.120
and four ideas for new features.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.776
It turned out the team was actively
working on two of those ideas

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.840
and had seriously considered a third.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.360
I got the job.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.896
We all know people who were ignored
or overlooked at first

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920
but went on to prove their critics wrong.
