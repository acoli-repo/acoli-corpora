00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.496
automating routine tasks
in many occupations

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
while augmenting and amplifying
human labor in others.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.496
At this rate, we should all be expecting
to do jobs we've never done before

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.039
for the rest of our careers.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.856
So what are the tools
and strategies we need

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.840
to identify tomorrow's high performers?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.896
In search for answers, I've consulted
with leaders across many sectors,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.536
read dozens of reports and research papers

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.280
and conducted some of my own
talent experiments.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.896
My quest is far from over,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.560
but here are three ideas to take forward.
