00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.056
Let's stop equating
experience with ability,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.880
credentials with competence.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.096
Let's stop settling
for the safe, familiar choice

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.080
and leave the door open
for someone who could be amazing.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.776
We need employers to let go
of outdated hiring practices

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.360
and embrace new ways
of identifying and cultivating talent,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.176
and candidates can help
by learning to tell their story

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.760
in powerful and compelling ways.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.720
We could live in a world where people
are seen for what they're truly capable of
