00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.000
My favorite story?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.976
Brian Acton, an engineering manager

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.856
who was rejected
by both Twitter and Facebook

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.496
before cofounding WhatsApp,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.160
the mobile messaging platform
that would sell for 19 billion dollars.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.736
The hiring systems we built
in the 20th century are failing us

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.040
and causing us to miss out
on people with incredible potential.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.456
The advances in robotics
and machine learning

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.456
and transforming the way we work,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.496
automating routine tasks
in many occupations
