00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.607
At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:12.515
dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:16.725
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.922
by regular janitors,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.094
but I never have the decency to honor their names.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.262
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:29.813
when teenage girls wear clothes that covers

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:34.652
their insecurities but exposes everything else.
