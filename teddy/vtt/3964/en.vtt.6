such as population or traffic information,

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.774
but it's made physical.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:06.806
We also believe that these dynamic
shape displays can really change

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.790
the ways that we remotely
collaborate with people.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.117
So when we're working together in person,

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:13.799
I'm not only looking at your face

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:16.861
but I'm also gesturing

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.891

you can reach out from the screen

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:27.027

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:30.226
So we used the pins of the display
to represent people's hands,
