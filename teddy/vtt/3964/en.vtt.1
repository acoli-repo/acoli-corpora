00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:32.562
in order to manipulate things
with much more precision.

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:36.404
But as tools have become
more and more complex,

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:40.306
we need more complex controls
to control them.

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:45.158
And so designers have become
very adept at creating interfaces

00:00:45.182 --> 00:00:48.920
that allow you to manipulate parameters
while you're attending to other things,

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:51.823
such as taking a photograph
and changing the focus

00:00:51.847 --> 00:00:53.183
or the aperture.

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:58.137
But the computer has fundamentally
changed the way we think about tools

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.175
because computation is dynamic.
