00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.728
by making it physical.

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:33.357
So the question is, how can we use this?

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
Traditionally, urban planners
and architects build physical models

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.334
of cities and buildings
to better understand them.

00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:44.573
So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab,
we created an interface built on inFORM

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:49.580
to allow urban planners
to design and view entire cities.

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:53.861
And now you can walk around it,
but it's dynamic, it's physical,

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:55.585
and you can also interact directly.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.347
Or you can look at different views,

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.188
such as population or traffic information,
