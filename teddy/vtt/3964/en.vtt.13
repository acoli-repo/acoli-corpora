So we've used pneumatic actuation
to create a morphing device

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.394
where you can go from something
that looks a lot like a phone ...

00:06:36.418 --> 00:06:38.648
to a wristband on the go.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.559
And so together with Ken Nakagaki
at the Media Lab,

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:45.137
we created this new
high-resolution version

00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:51.111
that uses an array of servomotors
to change from interactive wristband

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:54.263
to a touch-input device

00:06:54.287 --> 00:06:55.532
to a phone.

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:57.214
(Laughter)

00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:00.276
And we're also interested
in looking at ways
