00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.965
Or you can interact through gestures
and direct deformations

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.286
to sculpt digital clay.

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:17.555
Or interface elements can arise
out of the surface

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.951
and change on demand.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:21.483
And the idea is that for each
individual application,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.807
the physical form can be matched
to the application.

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.301
And I believe this represents a new way

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:29.275
that we can interact with information,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.728
by making it physical.
