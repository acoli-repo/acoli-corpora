00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.710
and brought undergrads in and convinced
them to do "research" --

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.748
(Laughter)

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:05.790
and had late nights
watching movies, eating pizza

00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:07.642
and screwing in thousands of screws.

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:08.864
You know -- research.

00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:10.435
(Laughter)

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.777
But anyway, I think that we were
really excited by the things

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.497
that inFORM allowed us to do.

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:19.721
Increasingly, we're using mobile devices,
and we interact on the go.

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:22.424
But mobile devices, just like computers,

00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.759
are used for so many
different applications.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.776
So you use them to talk on the phone,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.956
to surf the web, to play games,
to take pictures

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.689
or even a million different things.
