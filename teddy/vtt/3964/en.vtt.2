00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.175
because computation is dynamic.

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:02.715
So it can do a million different things

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.088
and run a million different applications.

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:08.857
However, computers have
the same static physical form

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.817
for all of these different applications

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.618
and the same static
interface elements as well.

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:16.396
And I believe that this
is fundamentally a problem,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.416
because it doesn't really allow us
to interact with our hands

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.867
and capture the rich dexterity
that we have in our bodies.

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:28.562
And my belief is that, then,
we must need new types of interfaces

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.345
that can capture these
rich abilities that we have
