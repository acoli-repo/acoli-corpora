00:06:58.104 --> 00:07:00.276
And we're also interested
in looking at ways

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.927
that users can actually
deform the interfaces

00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:05.839
to shape them into the devices
that they want to use.

00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:08.271
So you can make something
like a game controller,

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.925
and then the system will understand
what shape it's in

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.568
and change to that mode.

00:07:14.052 --> 00:07:15.624
So, where does this point?

00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:17.576
How do we move forward from here?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.195
I think, really, where we are today

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.973
is in this new age
of the Internet of Things,

00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:24.788
where we have computers everywhere --

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.930
they're in our pockets,
they're in our walls,

00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:30.520
they're in almost every device
that you'll buy in the next five years.
