WEBVTT

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.345
that can capture these
rich abilities that we have

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.739
and that can physically adapt to us

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.013
and allow us to interact in new ways.

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:39.624
And so that's what I've been doing
at the MIT Media Lab

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.972
and now at Stanford.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.512
So with my colleagues,
Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii,

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:46.925
we created inFORM,

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:49.447
where the interface can actually
come off the screen

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:51.747
and you can physically manipulate it.

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.514
Or you can visualize
3D information physically

00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:58.052
and touch it and feel it
to understand it in new ways.
