00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:00.795
Or you can feel in your pocket
new types of tactile sensations

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.621
that are richer than the vibration.

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:05.880
Or buttons can emerge from the side
that allow you to interact

00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:07.612
where you want them to be.

00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:12.731
Or you can play games
and have actual buttons.

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:15.302
And so we were able to do this

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:20.080
by embedding 40 small, tiny
linear actuators inside the device,

00:06:20.104 --> 00:06:22.159
and that allow you not only to touch them

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:24.087
but also back-drive them as well.

00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.089
But we've also looked at other ways
to create more complex shape change.

00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:32.505
So we've used pneumatic actuation
to create a morphing device
