00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:30.226
So we used the pins of the display
to represent people's hands,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.756
allowing them to actually touch
and manipulate objects at a distance.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.793
And you can also manipulate
and collaborate on 3D data sets as well,

00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:46.486
so you can gesture around them
as well as manipulate them.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.900
And that allows people to collaborate
on these new types of 3D information

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:54.535
in a richer way than might
be possible with traditional tools.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.623
And so you can also
bring in existing objects,

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:01.861
and those will be captured on one side
and transmitted to the other.
