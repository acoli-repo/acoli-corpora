00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:01.861
and those will be captured on one side
and transmitted to the other.

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:04.671
Or you can have an object that's linked
between two places,

00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:06.779
so as I move a ball on one side,

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.730
the ball moves on the other as well.

00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:13.381
And so we do this by capturing
the remote user

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:16.210
using a depth-sensing camera
like a Microsoft Kinect.

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:19.775
Now, you might be wondering
how does this all work,

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.450
and essentially, what it is,
is 900 linear actuators

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:25.760
that are connected to these
mechanical linkages

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:29.530
that allow motion down here
to be propagated in these pins above.

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.121
So it's not that complex
compared to what's going on at CERN,
