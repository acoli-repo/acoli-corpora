00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:30.723
I really think that we need to think
about a new, fundamentally different way

00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:32.905
of interacting with computers.

00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:36.505
We need computers
that can physically adapt to us

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:39.130
and adapt to the ways
that we want to use them

00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:43.701
and really harness the rich dexterity
that we have of our hands,

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:47.996
and our ability to think spatially
about information by making it physical.

00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:52.659
But looking forward, I think we need
to go beyond this, beyond devices,

00:08:52.683 --> 00:08:56.076
to really think about new ways
that we can bring people together,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.118
and bring our information into the world,

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:03.095
and think about smart environments
that can adapt to us physically.
