they're in almost every device
that you'll buy in the next five years.

00:07:30.544 --> 00:07:33.425
But what if we stopped
thinking about devices

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.843
and think instead about environments?

00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:38.379
And so how can we have smart furniture

00:07:38.403 --> 00:07:41.719
or smart rooms or smart environments

00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:44.835
or cities that can adapt to us physically,

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:49.090
and allow us to do new ways
of collaborating with people

00:07:49.114 --> 00:07:51.352
and doing new types of tasks?

00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:54.760
So for the Milan Design Week,
we created TRANSFORM,

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:58.608
which is an interactive table-scale
version of these shape displays,

00:07:58.632 --> 00:08:01.815
which can move physical objects
on the surface; for example,
