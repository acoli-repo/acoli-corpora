00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.689
or even a million different things.

00:05:31.713 --> 00:05:34.697
But again, they have the same
static physical form

00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:36.839
for each of these applications.

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:40.226
And so we wanted to know how can we take
some of the same interactions

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.933
that we developed for inFORM

00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:43.845
and bring them to mobile devices.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.074
So at Stanford, we created
this haptic edge display,

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.275
which is a mobile device
with an array of linear actuators

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:52.646
that can change shape,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.567
so you can feel in your hand
where you are as you're reading a book.

00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:00.795
Or you can feel in your pocket
new types of tactile sensations
