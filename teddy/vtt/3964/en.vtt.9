00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.121
So it's not that complex
compared to what's going on at CERN,

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:35.471
but it did take a long time
for us to build it.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.750
And so we started with a single motor,

00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:39.189
a single linear actuator,

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:42.979
and then we had to design
a custom circuit board to control them.

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:45.055
And then we had to make a lot of them.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:48.693
And so the problem with having
900 of something

00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:51.837
is that you have to do
every step 900 times.

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:54.218
And so that meant that we had
a lot of work to do.

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:57.974
So we sort of set up
a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.710
and brought undergrads in and convinced
them to do "research" --
