00:00:00.811 --> 00:00:04.364
We've evolved with tools,
and tools have evolved with us.

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:09.407
Our ancestors created these
hand axes 1.5 million years ago,

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:12.453
shaping them to not only
fit the task at hand

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:13.945
but also their hand.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.327
However, over the years,

00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:18.881
tools have become
more and more specialized.

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:23.130
These sculpting tools
have evolved through their use,

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:26.716
and each one has a different form
which matches its function.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.408
And they leverage
the dexterity of our hands

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:32.562
in order to manipulate things
with much more precision.
