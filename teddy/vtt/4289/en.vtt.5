00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:31.800
richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.957
pose a real risk for exploitation,

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:38.842
especially in the context of externally-funded research.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:41.448
Sadly enough, the fact remains that

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:45.432
a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.008
could never be authorized in the richer countries

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.256
which fund the research.

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.503
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.419
what makes developing countries,

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.963
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:02:56.963 --> 00:03:00.530
so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
