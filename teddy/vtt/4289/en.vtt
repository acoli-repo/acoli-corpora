00:00:01.577 --> 00:00:03.573
I'd like to share with you

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:07.410
the story of one of my patients called Celine.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.563
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:13.635
of Cameroon in west Central Africa.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.322
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.323
she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:23.394
which was running in her health district at the time.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:27.098
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:28.782
she had gone for 18 months

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.069
without any antiretroviral therapy,
