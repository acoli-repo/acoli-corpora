00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:45.867
Local governments need to set up effective systems

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:48.744
for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials

00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:52.661
which are authorized in different developing countries,

00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:54.935
and they need to do this by setting up

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:57.445
ethical review committees that are independent

00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:00.830
of the government and research sponsors.
