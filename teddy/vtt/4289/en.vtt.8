lower risk of litigation,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.387
less rigorous ethical reviews,

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:06.943
and populations that are willing to participate

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:11.607
in almost any study that hints at a cure.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:15.232
As funding for HIV research

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.488
increases in developing countries

00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:21.495
and ethical review in richer countries become more strict,

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.580
you can see why this context becomes

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.141
very, very attractive.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.821
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers

00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.305
to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable
