00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.069
without any antiretroviral therapy,

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.806
and she was very ill.

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:36.204
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:37.755
when the trial ended

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.466
because she had no money for the bus fare

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.194
and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:45.938
Now during the clinical trial,

00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:50.323
she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:52.354
and her transportation costs

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.961
had been covered by the research funds.

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.315
All of these ended once the trial was completed,

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:01.307
leaving Celine with no alternatives.
