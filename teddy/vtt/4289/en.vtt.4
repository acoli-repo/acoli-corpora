00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.275
But it would have done so at a price

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.222
to hundreds of patients who, like Celine,

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.466
were left to their own devices

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.537
once the research had been completed.

00:02:08.537 --> 00:02:11.875
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.888
that conducting HIV clinical trials

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:16.103
in developing countries is bad.

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:20.470
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.768
and are much needed to address the burden

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.239
of disease in developing countries.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.098
However, the inequalities that exist between

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:31.800
richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding
