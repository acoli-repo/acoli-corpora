00:02:56.963 --> 00:03:00.530
so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.802
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:06.918
valid and widely applicable results,

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:10.918
they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants

00:03:10.918 --> 00:03:13.561
and preferably on a population

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.342
with a high incidence of new HIV infections.

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.813
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:24.015
with 22 million people living with HIV,

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:27.655
an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:30.136
who are infected worldwide.
