00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:30.237
are often inappropriate or ineffective

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:32.590
in a lot of developing countries.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.563
For example, it is counterintuitive to have

00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:38.562
an illiterate study participant, like Celine,

00:05:38.562 --> 00:05:41.889
sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.996
let alone understand.

00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:47.076
Local communities need to be more involved

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:50.349
in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.050
in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.866
The information in these trials

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.817
needs to be given to the potential participants

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:04.245
in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
