If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:04.456
then I think they should have to ethically justify

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:08.483
why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.

00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:10.799
Now, fortunately for Celine,

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:13.474
our meeting did not end in my office.

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:17.848
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.236
closer to her home,

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:23.010
and with a support group to help her cope.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.344
Her story has a positive ending,

00:09:25.344 --> 00:09:29.047
but there are thousands of others in similar situations

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:31.344
who are much less fortunate.
