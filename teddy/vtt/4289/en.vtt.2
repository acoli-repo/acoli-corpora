00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:01.307
leaving Celine with no alternatives.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.983
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs

00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.010
she'd received during the trial,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.767
or even what the trial had been about.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.316
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:16.723
because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:18.992
Yet what puzzled me most

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:22.099
was Celine had given her informed consent

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.931
to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.401
the implications of being a participant

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:32.810
or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
