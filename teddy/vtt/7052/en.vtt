00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:04.268
Whether we want to or not,
humans spend a great deal of time

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.018
considering death.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.976
And it's possible we've been doing so
since shortly after homo sapiens

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.601
first began roaming the landscape.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.393
After all, the first
intentional human burial

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:19.208
is thought to have occurred
around 100,000 years ago.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.101
What might those early people
have been thinking

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.059
as they took the time
to dig into the earth,

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.351
deposit the body

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.851
and carefully cover it up again?

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.559
Were they trying
to protect it from scavengers
