are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
are almost equally happy on average?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
