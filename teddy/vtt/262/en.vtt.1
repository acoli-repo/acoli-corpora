Two years ago at TED, I think --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've come to this conclusion --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I think that I may have believed unconsciously,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then, that I was kind of a business hero.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it was a magazine publishing company.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It had recently gone public

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,
