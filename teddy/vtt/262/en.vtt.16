00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
a little bit about everything that surrounds it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And so, gradually over these three days,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you start off kind of trying to figure out,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And at the end of the four days,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and it's because all these different bits have been put together.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.
