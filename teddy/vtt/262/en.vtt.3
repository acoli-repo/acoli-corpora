Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The date was February 2000.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I thought the little graph of my business life

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.
