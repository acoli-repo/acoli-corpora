Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They may well be by a TED speaker,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and so we can get the conversation going during the year
