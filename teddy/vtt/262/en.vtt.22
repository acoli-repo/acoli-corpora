00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and so we can get the conversation going during the year

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I think it will be great.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
which is the new owner of TED.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here
