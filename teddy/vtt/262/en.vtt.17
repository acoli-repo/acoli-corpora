It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000

Every mental organ addressed. It really is.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
"Chris, TED is a really great conference.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."
