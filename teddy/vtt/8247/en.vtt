00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:03.374
At the very young age
of less than one year old,

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:06.169
a violent civil war broke out
in my home country

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.504
of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.507
As a result, my family was forced to flee.

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.217
And as luck would have it,

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:15.470
we found safety in Kyangwali refugee camp,

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:17.180
located in western Uganda,

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:19.640
where I grew up from
and have learned to call home

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.559
for the past 24 years.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.687
Every morning, my two parents
would wake up at 5am

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:28.149
and leave for the fields where they went
to cultivate our small garden,

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:30.651
to plant maize and beans
to feed the family.
