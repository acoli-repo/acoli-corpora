00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.216
Humans do not see trees.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.476
They walk by us every day.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.507
They sit and sleep, smoke and picnic

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:11.910
and secretly kiss in our shade.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:15.436
They pluck our leaves
and gorge on our fruits.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.166
They break our branches

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.206
or carve their lover's name
on our trunks with their blades

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.493
and vow eternal love.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.616
They weave necklaces out of our needles

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.386
and paint our flowers into art.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.726
They split us into logs
to heat their homes,
