00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So how does it work?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You have a cassette with 10 samples.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here it's already at the third sample.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This is a positive sample.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And by doing so, very fast,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we can have like a second-line opinion

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to see which patients are positive,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
which are negative.
