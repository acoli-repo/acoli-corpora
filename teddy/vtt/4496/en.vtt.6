00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and to communicate about it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now how do we communicate with rats?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Well don't talk rat,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but we have a clicker,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a standard method for animal training,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which you see there.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A clicker, which makes a particular sound

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Once the animal knows click, food,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
click, food, click, food --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so click is food --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we bring it in a cage with a hole,
