00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
between 30 and 40 percent.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So this is really considerable.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
infects up to 15 people,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
healthy people, per year,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you can be sure

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that we have saved lots of lives.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
The way forward for us

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is now to standardize this technology.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And there are simple things

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where the animal has to stick for five seconds.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So, to standardize this.
