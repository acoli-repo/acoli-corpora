00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so click is food --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we bring it in a cage with a hole,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and actually the animal learns

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to stick the nose in the hole

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
under which a target scent is placed,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and to do that for five seconds --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
five seconds, which is long for a rat.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It learns how to find the target smell

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then the animal learns

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to walk on a leash in the open

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and find targets.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In the next step, animals learn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to find real mines in real minefields.
