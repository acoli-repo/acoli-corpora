00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to be operational in the field --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
just like dogs, by the way.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Maybe one slight difference:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we can train rats at a fifth of the price

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of training the mining dog.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
This is our team in Mozambique:

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
one Tanzanian trainer,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
who transfers the skills

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to these three Mozambican fellows.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They have a skill,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which makes them much less dependent

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
on foreign aid.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Moreover, this small team

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles
