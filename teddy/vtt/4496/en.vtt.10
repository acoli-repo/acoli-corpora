00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Moreover, this small team

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the manual de-miners to follow-up.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But with this small investment in a rat capacity,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we have demonstrated in Mozambique

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
up to 60 percent

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of what is currently normal --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and we can still bring that price down.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Question of scale.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If you can bring in more rats,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
we can actually make the output even bigger.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
