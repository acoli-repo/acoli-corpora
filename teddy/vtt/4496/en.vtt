00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here today to share with you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
an extraordinary journey -

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
extraordinarily rewarding journey,
actually -

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which brought me into

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
training rats

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to save human lives

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by detecting landmines

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and tuberculosis.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As a child, I had two passions.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One was a passion for rodents.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I had all kinds of rats,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
mice, hamsters,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
gerbils, squirrels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
