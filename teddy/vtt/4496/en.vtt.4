00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, actually rats are,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in contrary to what most people think about them,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
rats are highly sociable creatures.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And actually, our product -- what you see here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There's a target somewhere here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You see an operator, a trained African

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with his rats in front

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who actually are left and right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There, the animal finds a mine.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It scratches on the soil.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And the animal comes back for a food reward.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Very, very simple.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Very sustainable in this environment.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Here, the animal gets its food reward.
