00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So in our common language, Dutch,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the name for T.B.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is "tering,"

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
which, etymologically,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
refers to the smell of tar.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Already the old Chinese

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and the Greek, Hippocrates,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
have actually published,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
based on the volatiles

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
exuding from patients.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So what we did is we collected some samples --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
just as a way of testing --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from hospitals,
