00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
a cage like this, operating throughout the day,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
can process 1,680 samples.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
environmental detection

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
of pollutants in soils,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
customs applications,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I just want to briefly highlight,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the blue rods

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are the scores of microscopy only

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
on a population of 500,000 people,
