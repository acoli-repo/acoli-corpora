00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
just as a way of testing --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from hospitals,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
trained rats on them

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and see if this works,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and wonder, well,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
86 percent specificity

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
using multiple rats in a row.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
This is how it works,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and really, this is a generic technology.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but can you imagine,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you can actually put anything under there.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So how does it work?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
