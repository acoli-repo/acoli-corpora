00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
engineer in product development,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
actually the first appropriate technologies

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for developing countries.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I started working in the industry,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but I wasn't really happy to contribute

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to a material consumer society

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a linear, extracting

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and manufacturing mode.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
landmines.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're talking '95 now.
