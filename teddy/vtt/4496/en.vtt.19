00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
on a population of 500,000 people,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
where 15,000 reported to get a test done.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and looping those results back,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we were able to increase case detection rates

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
by over 30 percent.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Throughout last year,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
we've been consistently

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
increasing case detection rates

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
between 30 and 40 percent.
