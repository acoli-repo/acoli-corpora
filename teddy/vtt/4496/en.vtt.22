This is in a prototype stage.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We don't have a working system here yet.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
To conclude, I would actually like to say,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you may think this is about rats, these projects,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
but in the end it is about people.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It is about empowering vulnerable communities

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to tackle difficult, expensive

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and doing that with a local resource,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
plenty available.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So something completely different

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
is to keep on challenging your perception

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
about the resources surrounding you,
