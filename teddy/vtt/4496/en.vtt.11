00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Eleven African governments

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
have seen that they can become less dependent

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
by using this technology.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
They have signed the pact for peace

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and treaty in the Great Lakes region,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and they endorse hero rats

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to clear their common borders of landmines.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But let me bring you to a very different problem.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And there's about 6,000 people last year

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that walked on a landmine,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but worldwide last year,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis
