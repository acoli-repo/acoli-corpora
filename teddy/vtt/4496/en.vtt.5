00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Very sustainable in this environment.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Here, the animal gets its food reward.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And that's how it works.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Very, very simple.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now why would you use rats?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Rats have been used since the '50s last century,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in all kinds of experiments.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Rats have more genetic material

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
allocated to olfaction

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
than any other mammal species.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They're extremely sensitive to smell.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and to communicate about it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now how do we communicate with rats?
