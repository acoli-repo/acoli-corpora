Princess Diana is announcing on TV

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that landmines form a structural barrier

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to any development, which is really true.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
As long as these devices are there,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or there is suspicion of landmines,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you can't really enter into the land.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
for new detectors

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
sustainable in the environments

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
where they're needed to produce,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is mainly in the developing world.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We chose rats.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Why would you choose rats?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Because, aren't they vermin?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, actually rats are,
