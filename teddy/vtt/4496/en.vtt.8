00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In the next step, animals learn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to find real mines in real minefields.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
They are tested and accredited

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
according to International Mine Action Standards,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just like dogs have to pass a test.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This consists of 400 square meters.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
There's a number of mines

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
placed blindly,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and the team of trainer and their rat

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
have to find all the targets.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
If the animal does that, it gets a license

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
as an accredited animal

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to be operational in the field --
