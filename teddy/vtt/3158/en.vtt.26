Of the big tech companies,

00:13:02.608 --> 00:13:08.171
it's really only two that depend
on behavior modification and spying

00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:09.452
as their business plan.

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:11.235
It's Google and Facebook.

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:12.569
(Laughter)

00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:14.284
And I love you guys.

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:17.029
Really, I do. Like, the people
are fantastic.

00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.553
I want to point out, if I may,

00:13:21.577 --> 00:13:22.728
if you look at Google,

00:13:22.752 --> 00:13:27.839
they can propagate cost centers
endlessly with all of these companies,

00:13:27.863 --> 00:13:29.911
but they cannot propagate profit centers.

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:33.116
They cannot diversify,
because they're hooked.
