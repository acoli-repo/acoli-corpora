In the case of virtual reality --

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.271
well, the way I used to talk about it

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.930
is that it would be something like

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:09.804

discovered language.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:14.503
With language came new adventures,
new depth, new meaning,

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:16.607
new ways to connect,
new ways to coordinate,

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.665
new ways to imagine,
new ways to raise children,

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.951
and I imagined, with virtual reality,
we'd have this new thing

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:26.568
that would be like a conversation

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:29.936
but also like waking-state
intentional dreaming.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.613
We called it post-symbolic communication,
