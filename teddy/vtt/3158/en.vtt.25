It could mean when you want
to get factual information,

00:12:32.477 --> 00:12:35.731
there's not a bunch of weird,
paranoid conspiracy theories.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.990
We can imagine this wonderful
other possibility.

00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:41.275
Ah.

00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:43.429
I dream of it. I believe it's possible.

00:12:43.453 --> 00:12:46.755
I'm certain it's possible.

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:51.526
And I'm certain that the companies,
the Googles and the Facebooks,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.862
would actually do better in this world.

00:12:53.886 --> 00:12:57.052
I don't believe we need
to punish Silicon Valley.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.329
We just need to remake the decision.
