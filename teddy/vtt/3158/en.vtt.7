00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.379
in a behaviorist system,

00:03:31.403 --> 00:03:33.904
and he has this amazing line
where he says,

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:36.666
one could imagine,
as a thought experiment --

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.151
and I'm paraphrasing,
this isn't a quote --

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:42.255
one could imagine a global computer system

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.121
where everybody has devices
on them all the time,

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.417
and the devices are giving them
feedback based on what they did,

00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:50.316
and the whole population

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.916
is subject to a degree
of behavior modification.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.486
And such a society would be insane,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.607
could not survive,
could not face its problems.
