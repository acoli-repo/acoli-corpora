00:10:59.112 --> 00:11:01.953
and remake that decision.

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:06.015
Remaking it would mean two things.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:09.967
It would mean first that many people,
those who could afford to,

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:12.198
would actually pay for these things.

00:11:12.222 --> 00:11:16.629
You'd pay for search,
you'd pay for social networking.

00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:20.114
How would you pay?
Maybe with a subscription fee,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.876
maybe with micro-payments as you use them.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.702
There's a lot of options.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.123
If some of you are recoiling,
and you're thinking,

00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:29.513
"Oh my God, I would never pay
for these things.

00:11:29.537 --> 00:11:31.632
How could you ever get anyone to pay?"
