Back in the 1980s, actually,
I gave my first talk at TED,

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:09.239
and I brought some of the very,
very first public demonstrations

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:13.497
of virtual reality ever to the TED stage.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:21.242
And at that time, we knew
that we were facing a knife-edge future

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:26.467
where the technology we needed,

00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.342
the technology we loved,

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.413
could also be our undoing.
