00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:31.141
and that difference
is that whether positive stimuli

00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:34.474
are more effective than negative ones
in different circumstances,

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:36.602
the negative ones are cheaper.

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:38.682
They're the bargain stimuli.

00:09:38.706 --> 00:09:44.409
So what I mean by that is it's much easier

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:47.549
to lose trust than to build trust.

00:09:47.573 --> 00:09:50.745
It takes a long time to build love.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:53.375
It takes a short time to ruin love.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:57.987
Now the customers of these
behavior modification empires

00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.434
are on a very fast loop.

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.503
They're almost like
high-frequency traders.
