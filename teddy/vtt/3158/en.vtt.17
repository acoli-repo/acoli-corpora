Pavlov, one of the early behaviorists,

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.563
demonstrated the famous principle.

00:08:33.587 --> 00:08:37.548
You could train a dog to salivate
just with the bell, just with the symbol.

00:08:37.572 --> 00:08:39.158
So on social networks,

00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:44.262
social punishment and social reward
function as the punishment and reward.

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:46.363
And we all know
the feeling of these things.

00:08:46.387 --> 00:08:47.838
You get this little thrill --

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:50.212
"Somebody liked my stuff
and it's being repeated."

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:52.570
Or the punishment:
"Oh my God, they don't like me,

00:08:52.594 --> 00:08:54.833
maybe somebody else
is more popular, oh my God."

00:08:54.857 --> 00:08:57.083
So you have those two
very common feelings,

00:08:57.107 --> 00:09:00.671
and they're doled out in such a way
that you get caught in this loop.
