everything on the internet
must be purely public,

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:03.331
must be available for free,

00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.743
because if even one person
cannot afford it,

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:09.339
then that would create
this terrible inequity.

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:12.436
Now of course, there's other ways
to deal with that.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.476
If books cost money,
you can have public libraries.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.674
And so forth.

00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:19.316
But we were thinking, no, no, no,
this is an exception.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.945
This must be pure public commons,
that's what we want.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.603
And so that spirit lives on.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:30.342
You can experience it in designs
like the Wikipedia, for instance,
