00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:02.226
And what started out as advertising

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.727
really can't be called
advertising anymore.

00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:07.663
It turned into behavior modification,

00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:12.180
just as Norbert Wiener
had worried it might.

00:07:12.204 --> 00:07:16.824
And so I can't call these things
social networks anymore.

00:07:16.848 --> 00:07:20.662
I call them behavior modification empires.

00:07:20.686 --> 00:07:22.921
(Applause)

00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:27.159
And I refuse to vilify the individuals.

00:07:27.183 --> 00:07:29.454
I have dear friends at these companies,

00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:34.238
sold a company to Google, even though
I think it's one of these empires.
