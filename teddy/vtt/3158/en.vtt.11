You can experience it in designs
like the Wikipedia, for instance,

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:31.707

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.605

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.217
we also believed, with equal fervor,

00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:40.178
in this other thing
that was completely incompatible,

00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:43.829
which is we loved our tech entrepreneurs.

00:05:43.853 --> 00:05:47.592
We loved Steve Jobs;
we loved this Nietzschean myth

00:05:47.616 --> 00:05:51.084

00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:02.781
So you have these two different passions,
