Now in the beginning, it was cute,

00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.174
like with the very earliest Google.

00:06:33.198 --> 00:06:34.484
(Laughter)

00:06:34.508 --> 00:06:37.405
The ads really were kind of ads.

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.914
They would be, like,
your local dentist or something.

00:06:39.938 --> 00:06:41.858
But there's thing called Moore's law

00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:45.024
that makes the computers
more and more efficient and cheaper.

00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:46.906
Their algorithms get better.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.526
We actually have universities
where people study them,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.178
and they get better and better.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:55.654
And the customers and other entities
who use these systems

00:06:55.678 --> 00:06:59.805
just got more and more experienced
and got cleverer and cleverer.

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:02.226
And what started out as advertising
