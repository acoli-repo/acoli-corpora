I was undetectable, and I welcomed
questions about my status.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.136
And I received a lot of questions

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.680
and a lot of comments,
both positive and negative.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.016
And I want to start with the negative,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.080
just to frame some of this ignorance
that I've mentioned before.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.536
And most of these negative comments
were passing remarks or assumptions.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.096
They would assume things
about my sex life or my sex habits.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.600
They would assume
I put myself or others at risk.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.120
But very often I would just be met
with these passing ignorant remarks.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.696
In the gay community,
it's common to hear the word "clean"
