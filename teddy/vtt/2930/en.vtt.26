00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.696
In the gay community,
it's common to hear the word "clean"

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.536
when you're referring to someone
who is HIV negative.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.136
Of course the flip side to that
is being unclean, or dirty,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.816
when you do have HIV.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.296
Now, I'm not sensitive

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.160
and I'm only truly dirty
after a day in the field,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.056
but this is damaging language.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.496
This is a community-driven stigma

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.776
that keeps many gay men
from disclosing their status,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.456
and it keeps those newly diagnosed

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.776
from seeking support
within their own community,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.840
and I find that truly distressing.
