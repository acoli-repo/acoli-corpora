00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.160
and they didn't know
what step to take next.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.616
They didn't want to tell their family,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.496
they didn't want to tell their friends

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.080
and they felt damaged,
and they felt dirty.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.576
And I did whatever I could
to immediately calm them,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.416
and then I would put them in contact
with AcadianaCares,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.656
which is a wonderful resource
we have in our community

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.040
for those with HIV.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.376
And I'd put them in contact
with people I knew personally

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.856
so that they could not only
have this safe space to feel human again,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.376
but so they could also have
the resources they needed
