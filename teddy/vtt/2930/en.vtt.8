00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.376
Where are the stories?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.216
Where are these people living with HIV?
Why haven't they been vocal?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.376
How can I believe these successes,
or these statistics,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.600
without seeing the successes?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.720
And this is actually
a very easy question for me to answer.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.976
Fear, stigma and shame:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.760
these keep those living with HIV
in the closet, so to speak.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.096
Our sexual histories are as personal
to us as our medical histories,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.536
and when you overlap the two,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.120
you can find yourself
in a very sensitive space.
