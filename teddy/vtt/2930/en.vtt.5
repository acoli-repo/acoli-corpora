No longer was it restricted
to these dark corners of society,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.056
to queers and drug users,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.576
but now it was affecting people

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.816
that society deemed
worthy of their empathy,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.136
to children.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.536
But that permeating fear
and that perception, it still lingers.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.776
And I want a show of hands
for these next few questions.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.536
How many of you in here
were aware that with treatment,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.896
those with HIV not only
fend off AIDS completely,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.000
but they live full and normal lives?
