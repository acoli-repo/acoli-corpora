00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.296
What separates that man up there

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.520
from me?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.736
The man in that photo is named David Kirby

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.256
and it was taken in 1990
as he was dying from AIDS-related illness,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.920
and it was subsequently
published in "Life Magazine."

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.696
The only real thing
separating me from Kirby

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.360
is about 30 years of medical advancements
in the way that we treat HIV and AIDS.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.040
So what I want to ask next is this:

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.856
If we have made such exponential progress
