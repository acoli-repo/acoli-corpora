00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.120
you can find yourself
in a very sensitive space.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.296
The fear of how others
perceive us when we're honest

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.096
keeps us from doing many things in life,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.800
and this is the case
for the HIV-positive population.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.136
To face social scrutiny and ridicule
is the price that we pay for transparency,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.616
and why become a martyr

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.056
when you can effectively pass
as someone without HIV?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.736
After all, there are no
physical indications you have the virus.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.360
There's no sign that you wear.
