00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.056
and being a fairly informed gay man,
I had read a bit on HIV,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.536
so to me, it clicked
that this was seroconversion,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.576
or as it's sometimes called,
acute HIV infection.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.096
And this is the body's reaction

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.000
in producing antibodies
to the HIV antigen.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.656
It's important to note that not everybody
goes through this phase of sickness,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.760
but I was one of the lucky ones who did.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.696
And I was lucky as in,
there were these physical symptoms

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.616
that let me know, hey, something is wrong,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.440
and it let me detect
the virus pretty early.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.416
So just to clarify,
just to hit the nail on head,
