00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.576
So I want to start this talk
by showing y'all a photo,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
and it's a photo many of you
have probably seen before.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.816
So I want you all to take a moment

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.536
and look at this photo,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.015
and really reflect on some
of the things that come to mind,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.240
and what are some
of those things, those words.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.040
Now, I'm going to ask you all
to look at me.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.320
What words come to mind
when you look at me?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.296
What separates that man up there
