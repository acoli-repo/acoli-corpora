It only takes a single misstep
before we're flat on the ground,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.176
and my misstep is pretty obvious.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.440
I had unprotected sex,

Fast-forward about three weeks,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.256

and being a fairly informed gay man,
I had read a bit on HIV,
