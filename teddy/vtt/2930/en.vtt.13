00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.416
So just to clarify,
just to hit the nail on head,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.000
I got tested on campus.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.696
And they said they would call me
the next morning with the results,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.136
and they called me,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.416
but they asked me to come in
and speak to the doctor on staff.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.720
And the reaction I received from her
wasn't what I was expecting.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.536
She reassured me what I already knew,
that this wasn't a death sentence,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.376
and she even offered
to put me in contact with her brother,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.760
who had been living with HIV
since the early '90s.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.336
I declined her offer,
but I was deeply touched.
