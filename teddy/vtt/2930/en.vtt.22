00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.880
So the reactions I received
haven't been all positive.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.016
Here in the South,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.416
we have a lot stigma
due to religious pressures,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.336
our lack of a comprehensive sex education

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.936
and our general conservative outlook
on anything sexual.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.920
We view this as a gay disease.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.016
Globally, most new HIV infections
occur between heterosexual partners,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.896
and here in the States,
women, especially women of color,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.200
are at an increased risk.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.896
This is not a gay disease.
It never has been.
