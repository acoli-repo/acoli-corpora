See, these are incredible advancements
that we have made in fighting HIV,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.616
yet they have not managed
to dent the perception

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
that most Americans have
of the virus and those living with it.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.416
And I don't want you to think
I'm downplaying the danger of this virus,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.880
and I am not ignorant of
the harrowing past of the AIDS epidemic.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.576
I am trying to convey
that there is hope for those infected

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.840
and HIV is not the death sentence
it was in the '80s.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.576
And now you may ask, and I asked
this question myself initially:

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.376
Where are the stories?
