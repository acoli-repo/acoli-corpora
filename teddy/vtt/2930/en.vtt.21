00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.896
We don't want to be seen as ignorant,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.496
and we definitely
don't want to be called it.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.536
But ignorance is not
synonymous with stupid.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.936
It's not the inability to learn.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.096
It's the state you're in before you learn.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.456
So when I saw someone
coming from a place of ignorance,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.696
I saw an opportunity for them to learn.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.856
And hopefully, if I could
spread some education,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.096
then I could mitigate
situations for others

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.176
like I had experienced with my roommates

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.320
and save someone else
down the line that humiliation.
