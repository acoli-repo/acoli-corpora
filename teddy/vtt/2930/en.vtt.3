Powerful images, like this one of Kirby,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.656
these were the faces of the AIDS crisis
in the '80s and '90s,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.816
and at the time the crisis
had a very obvious impact

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.936
on an already stigmatized group of people,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.440
and that was gay men.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.016
So what the general straight public saw
was this very awful thing

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.280
happening to a group of people who
were already on the fringes of society.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.496
The media at the time began
to use the two almost interchangeably --

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.176
gay and AIDS --

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.296
and at the 1984
Republican National Convention,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.680
one of the speakers joked
that gay stood for: "Got AIDS yet?"
