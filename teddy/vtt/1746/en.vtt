Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it might have given it away --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs. 


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I was amputated at age one,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
