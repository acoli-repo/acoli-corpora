00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:31.521
or is math the native language of
the universe itself,

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.734
existing whether we find 
its truths or not?

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.102
Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real,

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:42.676
or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal?

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:46.235
The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.796
The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.261
living entities and universal principles.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:57.568
They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers

00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.829
and source of all creation.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.644
Numbers were active agents in nature.
