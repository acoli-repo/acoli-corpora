"God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man."

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.533
During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.131
there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct.

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.501
Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics,

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.969
as Euclid had done with geometry.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.525
He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.700
but a game nonetheless.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.231
Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.238
believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:30.535
dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures,
