Numbers were active agents in nature.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:05.499
Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:10.444
and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them.

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:13.897
Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.702
was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:21.926
Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically,

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.047
mathematical statements definitely don't.

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:29.586
Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:32.613
Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise,
