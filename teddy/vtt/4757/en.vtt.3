00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:32.613
Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise,

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:36.356
with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought,

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:40.997
a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains,

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:46.694
built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:50.373
One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker,

00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:53.997
a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany.

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.451
His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement:

00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.960
"God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man."
