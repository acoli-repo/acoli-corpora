00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.095
became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:31.834
and won a Nobel prize.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:34.426
And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:38.040
while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.548
Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature,

00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:44.036
from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements,

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.857
to the structure of a pineapple,

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:48.497
even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs.

00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:52.704
Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s,

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:57.291
which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later.

00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:58.707
Here's an even bigger jump:

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.933
mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771
