00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:30.535
dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures,

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:35.001
proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces,

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.363
was not a universal truth,

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:42.051
but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules.

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.865
But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.173
coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics,"

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:53.283
pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:55.482
and discovered by people.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:58.388
Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:03.379
developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena,
