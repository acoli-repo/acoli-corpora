00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:03.379
developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena,

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.873
have proven decades 
or even centuries later,

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:08.337
to be the framework necessary to explain

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.440
how the universe
has been working all along.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.688
For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy,

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:19.377
who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.918
in describing any phenomena
in the real world,

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:24.660
helped establish cryptography.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.938
Another piece of his purely
theoretical work

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.095
became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics,
