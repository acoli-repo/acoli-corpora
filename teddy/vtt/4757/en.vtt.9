00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:34.017
Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation?

00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:38.458
These questions are so deep the debate
often becomes spiritual in nature.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.550
The answer might depend on the specific
concept being looked at,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.177
but it can all feel like a
distorted zen koan.

00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:48.806
If there's a number of trees in a forest,
but no one's there to count them,

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:50.726
does that number exist?
