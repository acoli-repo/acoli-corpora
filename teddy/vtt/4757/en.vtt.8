00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.933
mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.185
to describe the geometry of position,

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:10.033
was used in the late 20th century
to explain how DNA unravels itself

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.212
during the replication process.

00:04:12.212 --> 00:04:16.161
It may even provide key explanations
for string theory.

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:18.791
Some of the most influential 
mathematicians and scientists

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.472
of all of human history
have chimed in on the issue as well,

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:24.093
often in surprising ways.

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.904
So, is mathematics an 
invention or a discovery?

00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:29.851
Artificial construct or
universal truth?

00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:34.017
Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation?
