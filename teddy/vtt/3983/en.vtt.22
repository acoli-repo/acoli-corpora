00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.329
which means for you as individuals,
if you want to give,

00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:04.060
please, by all means do it.

00:11:04.084 --> 00:11:07.647
But know that how you give
is just as important

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:09.678
as how much you give.

00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:12.592
Regular contributions
like monthly contributions

00:11:12.616 --> 00:11:15.904
are a far more effective way of giving,

00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:18.641
because they allow
humanitarian organizations

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:22.990
to properly plan and be invested
over the long term,

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:28.639
and to be present in the lives of families
who have been affected by war,

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:32.899
wars that many of us, frankly,
all too quickly forget.
