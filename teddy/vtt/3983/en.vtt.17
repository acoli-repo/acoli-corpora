00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:36.836
or when you consider that arms
that were shipped to Libya

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.573
are now actively drifting
across the Sahel,

00:08:39.597 --> 00:08:44.340
and ending up with groups
like Boko Haram and al Qaeda

00:08:44.364 --> 00:08:47.069
and other militant groups.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.784
And therein lies the problem.

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:51.618
Because, you see,

00:08:51.642 --> 00:08:57.161
small arms anywhere
are a menace everywhere,

00:08:57.831 --> 00:09:02.174
because their first stop
is rarely their last.
