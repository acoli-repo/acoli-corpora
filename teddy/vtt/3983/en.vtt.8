00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:00.589
going in and out of war zones
around the world,

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:02.756
I have come to understand

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.700
that there are aspects of this problem

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:08.802
that we, all of us, as people
occupying this shared space,

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.604
that we can change --

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:15.562
not through force or coercion or invasion,

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:19.315
but by simply looking at all
of the options available to us

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.058
and choosing the ones that favor
peace at the expense of war,

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:29.924
instead of war at the expense of peace.
