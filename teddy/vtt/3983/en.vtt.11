00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.818
Can anything be done about this?

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:33.802
To answer that question,

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.836
let's take a look
at this map of the world.

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:40.630
And now, let's add in all of the countries
that are currently at war,

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.600
and the number of people
who have either died

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.092
or have been displaced
as a result of that violence.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:47.512
It is a staggering number --

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:50.233
more than 40 million people.

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:53.431
But you will also notice
something else about this map.

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.575
You will notice
that most of those countries

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.953
are in the Global South.

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.743
Now, let's look at the countries

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:04.622
that are the world's top 20 exporters
of small arms in the world.
