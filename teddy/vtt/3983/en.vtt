00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.358
Thank you very much. Good evening.

00:00:02.382 --> 00:00:05.698
Some of you may have noticed
that my last name is Nutt.

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:09.139
And if you did,
you are forgiven for wondering

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:12.079
how a Nutt managed
to end up in a war zone.

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:16.444
I actually was offered, right out
of medical school, and accepted

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:20.305
a volunteer contract to work
with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.808
that was worth one dollar.

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:25.243
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.402
in the event that the UN needed
to issue an evacuation order,

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:30.496
so that I would be covered.
