00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.080
Now, we can have a circular argument here

00:08:02.104 --> 00:08:06.176
about whether this increase
in fatalities is a response

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.109
to the increase of small arms,
or the other way around.

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:12.629
But here's what we should
really take away from this.

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:14.313
What we should take away from this

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:18.755
is that this is a relationship
worth scrutinizing,

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:24.313
especially when you consider
that small arms that were shipped to Iraq

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.131
for use by the Iraqi Army,

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:29.402
or to Syria for so-called
moderate opposition fighters,

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.619
that those arms, many of them,
are now in the hands of ISIS;
