00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:33.271
because you see there has been
a boom in the small-arms trade

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:35.079
since the start of the War on Terror.

00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:38.301
In fact, it is a business
that has grown threefold

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.268
over the past 15 years.

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:44.245
And now let's compare that
to the number of people

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.095
who have directly died
in armed conflict around the world

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:49.294
in that same period.

00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:51.072
What do you notice?

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.453
Well, you notice that, in fact,
that also goes up

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:55.088
roughly three- to fourfold.

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:58.777
They basically go up
and end at the same point.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.080
Now, we can have a circular argument here
