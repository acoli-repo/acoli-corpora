00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:31.621
Well, it is essentially a problem
of both supply and demand,

00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.588
so we can tackle it from both sides.

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:35.663
On the supply side,

00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:38.861
we can push our governments

00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:41.948
to adopt international arms
transparency mechanisms

00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:43.773
like the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:09:43.797 --> 00:09:47.564
which makes it so that rich countries
have to be more accountable

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.263
for where their arms are going

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:51.686
and what their arms might be used for.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.975
Here in the United States,

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:57.616
the largest arms-exporting country
in the world by far,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.565
President Obama has rightly signed
the Arms Trade Treaty,
