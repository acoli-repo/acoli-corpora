00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:04.622
that are the world's top 20 exporters
of small arms in the world.

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.801
And what do we notice?

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:08.794
Well, you see them in green.

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:12.708
You will notice that those are mostly
countries in the Global North,

00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:14.430
primarily Western countries.

00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:15.670
What does this tell us?

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:19.185
This tells us that most of the people
who are dying in war

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.112
are living in poor countries,

00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:23.950
and yet most of the people
who are profiting from war

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:28.971
are living in rich countries --
people like you and me.

00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:32.606
And then what if we go
beyond small arms for a second.
