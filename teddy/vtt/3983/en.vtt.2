00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:02.363
300,000 people,

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:06.543
mostly as a result
of war-related famine and disease.

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:11.434
I was part of a team that was tasked
with trying to figure out

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:14.427
how best to respond
to this humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.554
It was right on the heels
of the Rwandan genocide,

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.245
and aid money to the region was drying up.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.311
Many aid organizations, unfortunately,

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:24.911
had been forced to close their doors.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:28.645
And so the question that I was asked
to specifically help answer,

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:34.345
which is one that aid workers ask
themselves in war zones the world over,
