00:11:56.684 --> 00:12:00.327
and listen to that haunting
"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:02.914
of automatic gunfire,

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:06.425
and wonder with absolute dread

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:10.885
how many minutes I have left
until it will be right on top of me.

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:16.593
I can tell you that it is a terrifying
and agonizing fear,

00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:20.974
one that millions of people
around the world are forced to confront

00:12:20.998 --> 00:12:23.164
each and every single day,

00:12:23.188 --> 00:12:24.521
especially children.

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:28.157
Over the years of doing this work,

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:33.293
unfortunately, war has killed
far too many people close to me.
