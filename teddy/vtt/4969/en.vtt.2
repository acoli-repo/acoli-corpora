as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.043
Understanding precisely how this 
phenomenon works

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.933
would have a bearing on so many 
aspects of our lives.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.313
Here’s what we do know.

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:12.813
Liquids and gases usually have 
two types of motion:

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:15.933
a laminar flow, which is stable 
and smooth;

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:21.253
and a turbulent flow, which is composed 
of seemingly unorganized swirls.

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:23.723
Imagine an incense stick.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:29.503
The laminar flow of unruffled smoke 
at the base is steady and easy to predict.

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:30.936
