00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:30.936
Closer to the top, however,

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.896
the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable,

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:38.426
and the pattern of movement changes
to something chaotic.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:40.336
That’s turbulence in action,

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:44.766
and turbulent flows have certain
characteristics in common.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:48.556
Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic.

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:50.596
That’s different from being random.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:55.386
Rather, this means that turbulence 
is very sensitive to disruptions.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.854
A little nudge one way or the other

00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:01.514
will eventually turn into 
completely different results.
