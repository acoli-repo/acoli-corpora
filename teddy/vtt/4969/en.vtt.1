00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.353
After more than a century 
of studying turbulence,

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.473
we’ve only come up with a few 
answers for how it works

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.823
and affects the world around us.

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.283
And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous,

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:44.143
springing up in virtually any system 
that has moving fluids.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.313
That includes the airflow 
in your respiratory tract.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.663
The blood moving through your arteries.

00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:53.073
And the coffee in your cup, 
as you stir it.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:55.313
Clouds are governed by turbulence,

00:00:55.313 --> 00:01:00.893
as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun.
