00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:01.514
will eventually turn into 
completely different results.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:05.094
That makes it nearly impossible 
to predict what will happen,

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:09.814
even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system.

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:12.242
Another important characteristic of 
turbulence

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:16.562
is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display.

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:21.192
Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies,

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:25.572
which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes.

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:28.837
All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other,

00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:31.227
breaking up to become smaller and smaller
