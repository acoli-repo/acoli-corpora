00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:33.479
that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.291
Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:41.951
that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible.

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.775
Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:47.896
because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts.

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.546
That would include more 
efficient wind farms;

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:53.966
the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events;

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:57.836
or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:03.017
And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.
