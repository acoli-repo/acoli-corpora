00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.024
Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars.

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:03.886
We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence.

00:04:03.886 --> 00:04:08.686
But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.790
as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.935
Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.049
and increased computing power.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.869
Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:27.869
could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:33.479
that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations.
