00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:31.227
breaking up to become smaller and smaller

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:34.887
until all that movement is 
transformed into heat,

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.457
in a process called the “energy cascade."

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:40.817
So that’s how we recognize turbulence–

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:42.557
but why does it happen?

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:46.657
In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces:

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:48.757
inertia and viscosity.

00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:52.167
Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving,

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.167
which causes instability.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.817
Viscosity works against disruption,

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.877
making the flow laminar instead.

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.917
In thick fluids such as honey,
