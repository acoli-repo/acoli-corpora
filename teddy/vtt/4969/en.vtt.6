00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.917
In thick fluids such as honey,

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:04.687
viscosity almost always wins.

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:09.687
Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia,

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:14.210
which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.310
We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.980
with something called the Reynolds number,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.230
which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.940
The higher the Reynolds number,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.200
the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.792
