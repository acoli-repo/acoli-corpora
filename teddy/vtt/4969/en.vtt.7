00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.792
Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example,

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.512
has a Reynolds number of about 1.

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:39.762
The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000.

00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.265
The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.595
but it’s ineffective in many situations.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:50.595
For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:55.335
by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.024
Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars.
