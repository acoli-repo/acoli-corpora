Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact what we're going to talk about,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
by a conversation than an address.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
