Okay? This is the size of the problem.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.450
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.892
That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:39.951
So what has changed?

00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:41.638
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:44.197
to an international audience, but I have to.

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:47.710
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.608
We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:55.254
a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:56.609
a suspicious piece of law

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:58.752
was passed at a suspicious time

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.650
to free some suspects. (Laughter)
