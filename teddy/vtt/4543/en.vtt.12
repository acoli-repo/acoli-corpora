00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.182
on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,

00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:02.742
our jubilee of independence.

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:04.764
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:08.175
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:09.862
because we all understood it,

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:11.620
and for the first time that I could remember,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.170
there were mass protests against this corruption.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.361
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?

00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:19.224
Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.593
you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:26.041
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:30.017
fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.
