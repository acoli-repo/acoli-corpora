And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:05.130
Are we getting a, yeah?—

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.129
That's what he told us.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.269
He told us that, in fact,

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.191
two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.575
that we spent, the taxpayers' money,

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.659
was wasted or stolen.

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.702
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.

00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:24.811
As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.

00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.506
That's for little children. We are big people,

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.293
and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.

00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:31.438
Okay? This is the size of the problem.
