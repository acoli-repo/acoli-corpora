WEBVTT

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.203
And I have the privilege at this time

00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:03.581
to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.

00:09:03.581 --> 00:09:07.178
We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders

00:09:07.178 --> 00:09:10.404
in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:12.564
about how public money is transacted.

00:09:12.564 --> 00:09:14.769
So those of you interested in finding out more about it,

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:19.049
or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:21.308
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:24.084
because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:26.420
for over three and a half years

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.909
is for transparency and accountability

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:32.008
around the bailout of CL Financial.
