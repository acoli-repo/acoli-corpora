00:15:56.236 --> 00:16:01.248
of public corruption according to this equation.

00:16:01.248 --> 00:16:04.217
And this is my reality check.

00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:06.563
Where you have an expenditure of public money

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:09.518
and it is without accountability

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:11.158
and it's without transparency,

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:13.414
it will always be equal to corruption,

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:16.619
whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:20.819
it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:23.130
I'm going to continue the work

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.476
to press on, to get some resolution

00:16:27.476 --> 00:16:29.186
of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.

00:16:29.186 --> 00:16:31.738
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.
