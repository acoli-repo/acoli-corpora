What if -- (Laughter)

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:32.819
But to make it in these wrongs,

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:34.444
you have to read a lot of spy novels

00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:37.011
and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)

00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:41.578
But what if this wasn't the first time?

00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:44.165
What if this is just the first time

00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:46.500
that the so-and-sos had been caught?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.626
What if it had happened before? How would I find out?

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.116
Now, the previous two examples I gave

00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:58.172
were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.203
And I have the privilege at this time
