00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.540
Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.675
which the private sector also participates in.

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.971
The second important myth to understand --

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.705
because we have to destroy these myths,

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:41.165
dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.111
the second important myth to understand

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.603
is the one that says

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:48.872
that in fact corruption is only a small problem --

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:51.202
if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:54.896
that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:58.787
it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,

00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:02.571
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.
