00:15:27.744 --> 00:15:32.661
So here we have it. We have a situation where

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:37.555
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability

00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:39.548
and transparency have all been discarded.

00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:41.792
I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:44.280
It's been ignored.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.455
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:50.057
we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.

00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:53.655
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:56.236
It's also the single largest example

00:15:56.236 --> 00:16:01.248
of public corruption according to this equation.
