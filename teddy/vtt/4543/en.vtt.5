00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:30.897
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:34.585
And it's ironic, because

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:36.623
we're standing today in the Central Bank.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.819
You see, history's rich in irony.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.641
We're standing today in the Central Bank,

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.019
and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.344
Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.

00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:50.092
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.131
the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:53.819
and there's a lot of connection with us today,

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.669
so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:01.569
(Applause)
