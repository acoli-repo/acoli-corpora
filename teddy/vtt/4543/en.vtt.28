00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.419
where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:08.291
that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:11.015
and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.

00:14:11.015 --> 00:14:14.006
And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,

00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:15.639

00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:24.147
Fantastic.

00:14:24.147 --> 00:14:26.097
But you see, the question is this:

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:30.310
If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act
