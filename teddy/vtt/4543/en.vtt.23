00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.587
that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience

00:11:30.587 --> 00:11:33.673
that took place in August,

00:11:33.673 --> 00:11:36.571
when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.235
going into September, forced me to check myself

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.294
and recalculate my bearings,

00:11:43.294 --> 00:11:45.516
and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written

00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:47.785
and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials

00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:49.789
to see what was really what.

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:53.899
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:55.723
Okay? We want to try to recalculate.

00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.147
And I made a Freedom of Information application

00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:02.061
in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.
