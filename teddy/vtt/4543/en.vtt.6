(Applause)

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.811
The first thing I want to talk about is that

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:07.507
when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:09.594
we embarked, the government of the day embarked

00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:11.704
on a series of government-to-government arrangements

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:13.738
to have rapidly develop the country.

00:03:13.738 --> 00:03:16.004
And some of the largest projects in the country

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.202
were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:21.018
with some of the leading countries in the world,

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:23.726
the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.794
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:28.478
this building was part of that series of complexes,

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:32.586
what they called the Twin Towers.
