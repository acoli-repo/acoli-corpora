00:16:29.186 --> 00:16:31.738
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.

00:16:31.738 --> 00:16:32.926
We will continue to press on.

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:34.877
We will continue to work within JCC.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:37.578
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context

00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:39.497
and bring something new to the table

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:41.323
in terms of an international example.

00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:44.224
We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking

00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:46.541
about her battle against government corruption,

00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:51.978
and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:56.648
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.427
for Freedom of Information applications,

00:16:59.427 --> 00:17:01.543
and speak with each other.
