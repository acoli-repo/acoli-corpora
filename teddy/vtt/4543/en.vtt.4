00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:02.571
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.

00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:04.931
And I want to demonstrate that that, too,

00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:06.868
is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:09.289
It's a piece of public mischief.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.883
And I want to speak a little bit,

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:14.131
take us back about 30 years.

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.125
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.323
a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:24.369
and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.862
and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:30.897
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.
