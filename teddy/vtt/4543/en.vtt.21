00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:32.556
Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?

00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:33.886
I'm serious now.

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:36.869
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.820
They've had bailouts in London.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.957
They've had bailouts in Europe.

00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:43.627
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major

00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:46.192
commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?

00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:48.433
It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:50.823
how they've treated it, and they've treated it

00:10:50.823 --> 00:10:52.694
very well compared to us.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.626
Nowhere on the planet

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:57.332
have all the creditors been bailed out

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:59.624
in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:03.206
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?
