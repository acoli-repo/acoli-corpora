00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:31.858
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.

00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:35.547
And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.162
so you could understand, as I said, where we are.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:39.683
Here is not like anywhere else.

00:12:39.683 --> 00:12:42.661
Question number one:

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:45.251
I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.723
and if you can't show me the accounts --

00:12:47.723 --> 00:12:49.688
the Minister of Finance is making statements,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:52.303
passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.

00:12:52.303 --> 00:12:54.594
What are the figures he's relying on?

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:57.214
It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:58.813
And they wrote back and said to me,

00:12:58.813 --> 00:13:00.524
well what do you really mean?
