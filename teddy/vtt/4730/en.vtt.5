00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.601
Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides.

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.828
What's this?

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:33.245
An angle.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.598
An angle from heaven.

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:38.523
What if I were to pinch each side, like so.

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.079
A third of the way through, just so.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.579
And do it again,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.911
and again,

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.661
and again.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.495
After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.029
because where there had been three line segments,

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.495
now there were four.

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:54.827
As for the area,

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:57.161
every pinch made more triangles, that's true.

00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.956
But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller.
