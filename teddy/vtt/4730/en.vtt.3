00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.994
this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle.

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.495
I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles.

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:36.911
Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone.

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:38.792
And I just kept going.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:40.494
After an infinite number of cuts,

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:43.713
I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area.

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:47.057
A bounded shape with zero area.

00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:49.224
Now, it's not often that I surprise myself,

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:52.389
but my own two mitts had created something crazy,

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.264
and new.

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:55.766
"Very good. (ahem)

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.602
Now, show me a shape with finite area,

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.939
but an infinitely long perimeter."
