00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:00.208
and why do they always come in threes?

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.473
"Is it an egg?"

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:03.224
"No. Why would it be an egg?"

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:04.870
"It's usually an egg."

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:08.466
"What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?"

00:01:11.223 --> 00:01:12.514
"Is it a dodo egg?"

00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:13.681
"It's not an egg!"

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.518
I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.329
and gave it a hard ponder.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.937
The size of the rising bump on my conk

00:01:18.937 --> 00:01:21.272
said to me that this thing had area,

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:23.078
and a lot of it.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.995
But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here?

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.245
As any mook could see,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.994
this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle.
