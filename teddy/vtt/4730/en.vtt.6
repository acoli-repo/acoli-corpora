00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.956
But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.957
You could say that the area was converging,

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:04.494
approaching a fixed number,

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.829
while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger,

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.328
uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown.

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:15.302
After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was:

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:19.160
Finite area, but infinite perimeter.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.162
Now that is a piece of work.

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:24.771
"Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three:

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.578
Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope,

00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:29.945
I'll keep seeing the original picture,

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.328
no matter how much I zoom in."
