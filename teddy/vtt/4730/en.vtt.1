00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.110
I was there for the dame.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.597

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.186
Said she wanted to go home.

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:39.622
Said I could help.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.788

Voice: "What are you doing here?"

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.482
"A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus."

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:54.140
Voice: "Well, to enter the cave,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.778
you must answer my riddles three."

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:58.029
What was it with riddles,

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:00.208
and why do they always come in threes?
