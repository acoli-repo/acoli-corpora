00:03:56.312 --> 00:04:00.311
but then I noticed: the box.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.186
The dame had played me like a triangle.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.934
She had told me she wanted to go home.

00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:06.952
(Lightning)

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:10.430
What she really wanted was to bring her home here.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.878
The fractals spread everywhere.

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:12.813
Most of them the same

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:14.710
no matter how deep you looked at them,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.483
like Dora's mugshot.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:18.670
Some had infinitely long perimeters,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.570
others were objects with no area or volume,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.379
all of them created through infinite repetition.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.307
So, you wanted to know what fractals are?

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.164
Well, kid, they're the stuff that dreams are made of.
