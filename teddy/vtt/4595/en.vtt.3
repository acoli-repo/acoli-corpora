00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:33.600
the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440
similar to modern stepper machines.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.268
Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water,

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:41.879
crush grain,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.197
or power mills,

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:46.217
which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated.

00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:50.742
These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape,

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:53.157
and that added benefit of powering mills

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:58.291
helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:02.338
It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners.
