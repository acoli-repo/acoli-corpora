00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:30.626
over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill,

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.678
and America, a similar amount.

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:36.471
Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.530
saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.261
not that prison guards seemed to care.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.848
In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:49.832
with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:55.654
the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror,"

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.121
a quote many still agree with.

00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:02.625
And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century,
