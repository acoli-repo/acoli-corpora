00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.536
So now go back to me sitting
with my thumb in the air

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.616
trying to line up something surprising.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.736
If the only things I'm allowed
to consider in the first place

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.856
are ideas that have already been done
over and over and over again,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.400
I am screwed.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.736
However, there are ways around this,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.176
because we all know that there are
tons of untried ideas still out there,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.856
and plenty of them will turn out
to be every bit as reliable as we need,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.256
it's just that we don't yet know
they are reliable

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.216
when we are at this planning phase.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.936
So what we do is we try
to identify some place
