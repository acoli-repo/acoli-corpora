00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.616
people will ask us again
how we thought of that idea,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.056
and we'll be stumped,
because from our perspective,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.216
it doesn't feel like
we thought of it at all,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.776
it just feels like we found it.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.976
So we'll play another video for you now
and the song along with it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.856
This is for the song "The One Moment,"

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.720
and for this one,
the sandbox was ballistics and math.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.696
So I spent a full month putting together
a giant spreadsheet for this.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.856
It was like my playspace
was 400 lines long

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.640
and 25 columns wide --

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.216
which I presume that if anybody is going
to understand that, it's this crowd.
