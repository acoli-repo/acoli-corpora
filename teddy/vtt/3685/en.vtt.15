00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.656
And this causes something of a problem,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.880
because ...

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.656
the process that we all use to make stuff,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.216
it actually has a very strong bias
against surprising ideas.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.896
The process I'm talking about
is the one you all know --

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.176
we all do it all the time.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.616
You think of an idea.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.776
You just sit and think
of your brilliant idea

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.376
and then you come up with a plan

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.576
for how you're going to make
that idea happen.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.176
And then with that plan in mind,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.416
you go back and double-check
your original idea

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.696
and maybe revise it,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.696
and then bouncing back and forth
between the idea and the plan,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.936
the plan and the idea,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.176
eventually you come up
with a truly great plan.
