00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
(Whistle)

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.136
(Laughter)

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.616
I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.616
so let's ratchet up
that reliability to 99 percent.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.496
.99 to the 130th power is ...

And could you really get 130 of them
all in one place at once?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.640
And if you really could,
