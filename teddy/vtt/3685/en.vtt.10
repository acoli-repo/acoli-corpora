I play parallax and perspective games
with my eyes pretty much all the time,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.896
and it's something I've been doing
since I was a teenager.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.656
And I think the big contributing
factor may have been

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.256
that this is how I decorated
my high school bedroom.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.896
(Laughter)

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.176
And being a teenager,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.936
what I did in there, of course,
was just talk on the phone

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.136
for staggering amounts of time.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.536
So I was in this visual maelstrom

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.736
just pretty much
usually sitting in one place,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.536
and I guess just
the overload in general --

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.736
my brain kind of tried
to make sense of it, and I would --

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.256
If I could move my head off
to one side a little bit,
