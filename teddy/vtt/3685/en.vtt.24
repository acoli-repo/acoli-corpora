00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.696
because at this point
we don't yet know what our idea is,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.456
we don't have a plan to be testing.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.976
So we're just --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.216
we're just playing,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.376
we're just trying everything
we can think of,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.496
because we need to get this idea space
filled up with a chaos

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.656
like the one in my high school bedroom.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.616
Because then, if we can
do the bob and weave thing,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.656
if we can put our thumbs up
and get just a few things to line up --

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.896
(Ding)

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.254
chances are no one else has ever made
those same things line up before.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.096
And when we're done with that project,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.616
people will ask us again
how we thought of that idea,
