that little chunk over there,
that puzzle piece that clicks right in.

of surprise to wonder,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.176
so we're not just looking for good ideas,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.920
we're looking for good ideas
that surprise us in some way.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.656
And this causes something of a problem,
