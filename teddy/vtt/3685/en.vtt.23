00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.176
Let's play with optical illusions.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.696
Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.520
Let's try to make toast
with a laser cutter.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.376
Or let's do something in one
of those zero-gravity airplanes.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.656
But then instead
of actually trying to sit there

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.496
and think out what that something is,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.456
we spent a full third of our budget
getting in an actual Vomit Comet

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.600
and bouncing off the walls for a week.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.096
So this may seem to you like testing,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.736
but it really isn't,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.696
because at this point
we don't yet know what our idea is,
