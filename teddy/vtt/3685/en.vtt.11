00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.256
If I could move my head off
to one side a little bit,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.616
the edge of the desk
would line up just perfectly

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.456
with that poster on the opposite wall;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.736
or if I put my thumb out,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.136
I could close first my left eye
and then my right,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.096
and my thumb would bounce back and forth

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.296
between Jimi Hendrix's
left eye and his right.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.536
(Laughter)

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.896
It was not a conscious thing, of course,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.176
this is just kind of the equivalent
of doodling while you're talking,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.296
and it's still something
I do all the time.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.656
This is my wife, Kristin --

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.856
(Applause)

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.336
Yeah!

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.560
Woo!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.896
And it's not uncommon
that we are out at dinner,
