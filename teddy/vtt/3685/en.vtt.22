00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.936
So what we do is we try
to identify some place

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.136
where there might just be
a ton of those untried ideas.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.376
We try to find a sandbox

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.936
and then we gamble
a whole bunch of our resources

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.776
on getting in that sandbox and playing.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.416
(Laughter)

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.456
Because we have to trust
that it's the process in the sandbox

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.336
that will reveal to us
which ideas are not only surprising,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.576
but surprisingly reliable.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.240
So some of the sandboxes
that we've started videos with.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.176
Let's play with optical illusions.
