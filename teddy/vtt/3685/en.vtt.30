00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.600
(Singing) So while the mud
reclaims our footprints,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.840
and while our bones keep looking back

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.880
at the overgrowth
that's swallowing the path --

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.800
but for the grace of God go we,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.640
but for the grace of God go we

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.456
But for the grace of time and chance
and entropy's cruel hands --

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.616
So open your arms to me,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.456
open your arms to me
