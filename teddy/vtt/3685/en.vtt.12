And it's not uncommon
that we are out at dinner,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.336
and in the middle of a great conversation
she'll just stop mid-sentence,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.776
and when she stops is when I realize
that I'm the one who's acting weird

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.616
because I'm like bobbing and weaving.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.216
And what I'm trying to do
is get that ficus back there

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.216
to stick out of her head like a ponytail.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.840
(Laughter)

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.496
The point of telling you
all this is that --

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.896
for me this is what it feels like
to have an idea.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.456
It's like they're made
of these disparate parts,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.856
these disparate chunks
sort of floating out there.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.936
And if you're receptive
and you're observant,
