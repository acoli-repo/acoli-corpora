00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.256
we choreographed
hundreds of people with umbrellas

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.656
in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.496
and then filmed them from a drone
a half a mile in the air.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.136
So it's all of these ideas
that people are curious about,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.416
and the reason we've had so much trouble
describing how we think of these ideas

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.840
is that it doesn't really feel
like we think of them at all.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.960
It feels like we find them.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.856
And by way of explanation --

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.056
well, I have a compulsive habit.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.136
I play parallax and perspective games
with my eyes pretty much all the time,
