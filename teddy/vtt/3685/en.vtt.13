00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.936
And if you're receptive
and you're observant,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.536
and crucially, if you're
in exactly the right place,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800
you can get them to just line up.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.696
So if you get used to --

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.256
if it's your job
to think of ideas this way,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.536
they'll start beckoning to you

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.976
the way that Jimi's eyes
beckoned from that poster,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.616
or the ficus beckons
from behind Kristin's head.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.616
Writing music feels like that process
just over and over again,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.016
like you've got a bunch of sounds
or a groove or a chord progression

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.736
and you're just looking
for that thing on the other side,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.336
that little chunk over there,
that puzzle piece that clicks right in.
