00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.840
to get every part of that system
to be 90 percent reliable.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.776
90 percent sounds good, right?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.056
Well, it's not.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.376
It's terrible actually.
The numbers say so.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.136
The chance of getting all 130 things
to not fail at the same time

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.416
is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.336
So calculate that out and you get ...

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.896
(Ding)

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.496
.000001,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.976
which is one ten-thousandth
of one percent,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.776
so your chance for success
is literally one in a million.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
