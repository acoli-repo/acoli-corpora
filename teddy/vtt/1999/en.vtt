00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:03.321
This is really a two-hour presentation
I give to high school students,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:04.596
cut down to three minutes.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.261
And it all started one day
on a plane, on my way to TED,

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:08.579
seven years ago.

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:12.976
And in the seat next to me
was a high school student, a teenager,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.007
and she came from a really poor family.

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.976
And she wanted to make
something of her life,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.039
and she asked me a simple little question.

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.008
She said, "What leads to success?"

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:23.411
And I felt really badly,

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.896
because I couldn't give her a good answer.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.976
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.730
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle
of a room of successful people!
