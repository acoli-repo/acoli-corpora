00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.402
"Iran is Israel's best friend,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.111
and we do not intend to change our position

00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:08.591
in relation to Tehran."

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.314
Believe it or not, this is a quote

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.513
from an Israeli prime minister,

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.957
but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.150
from the era of the Shah.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.568
It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:22.054
The year is 1987.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.975
Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.913
and much like Ahmadinejad today,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:28.813
he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:31.692
Yet, Rabin referred to Iran
