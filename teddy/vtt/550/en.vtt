Bruce Lee is my father,

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.768
and he is best well-known
as a martial artist

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:06.309
and an action film star,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.434
as I'm sure most of you know.

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.809
He died when I was four years old,

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.393
but I have a really deep memory of him.

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:18.476
I don't have those long-form, storied
memories that you do when you're older,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.792
but the memory that I do have
is of the feeling of him.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.893
I remember his energy,

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:28.184
his presence,

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.476
his love --

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.768
the safety of it,
