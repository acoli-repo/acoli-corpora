00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.580
from what you would expect
from many artists.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.962
I'm essentially dropping a basic idea
into a group, into a community,

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:08.491
people start gravitating to the idea,

00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:11.851
and together, we shape 
and build the artwork.

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:14.018
It's a little bit like termites, really.

00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:15.308
We just work together,

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:18.264
and even, for example,
when architects visit what we're doing,

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.849
sometimes they have a bit
of a hard time understanding

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.527
how we build without a master plan.

00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:25.986
We always come up with these
fantastic large-scale scupltures

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.528
that actually we can also inhabit.

00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:33.022
The first version was done
in Belgium and Holland.
