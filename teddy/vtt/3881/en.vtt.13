00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.598
So we're trying to redefine
how we look at our future in outer space

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:36.002
by exploring integration,
biology, technology and people;

00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:38.652
by using a cocreation approach;

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:42.099
and by using and exploring
local traditions

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.528
and to see how we can learn from the past
and integrate that into our deep future.

00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:48.321
Thank you.
