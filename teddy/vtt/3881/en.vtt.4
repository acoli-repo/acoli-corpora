00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.394
We will venture into outer space,
and we will start inhabiting outer space.

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.159
I have no doubt about it.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.744
It might take 50 years
or it might take 500 years,

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:08.443
but it's going to happen nevertheless.

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:12.434
So I came up with
a new art project called Seeker.

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:16.355
And the Seeker project is actually
challenging communities all over the world

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:19.209
to come up with starship prototypes

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.513
that re-envision
human habitation and survival.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.382
That's the core of the project.

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:26.739
Now, one important thing:

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.244
This is not a dystopian project.

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.956
This is not about, "Oh my God,
the world is going wrong
