00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:00.407
in the Museum of Modern Art
in Ljubljana in Slovenia,

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:03.025
where six artists and designers
locked themselves up --

00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:04.935
I was part of that --

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.173
for four days inside the museum.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.928
And, of course, obviously,
this is a very performative

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:14.130
and very strong experience for all of us.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.549
Now, the next version of the project
is currently being developed

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.512
together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,
who is also a TED Fellow,

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:26.788
in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
a magical place.

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:29.896
First of all, it's really
considered a Mars analogue.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.590
It really does look like Mars
in certain locations
