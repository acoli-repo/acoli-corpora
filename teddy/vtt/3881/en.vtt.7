00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:33.022
The first version was done
in Belgium and Holland.

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.924
It was built with a team
of almost 50 people.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.785
This is the second iteration
of that same project,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.745
but in Slovenia, in a different country,

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:44.987
and the new group was like, we're going 
to do the architecture differently.

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:48.291
So they took away the architecture,
they kept the base of the artwork,

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.343
and they built an entirely new,

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.014
much more biomorphic
architecture on top of that.

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.429
And that's another
crucial part of the project.

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:59.310
It's an evolving artwork,
evolving architecture.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.137
This was the last version that was just
presented a few weeks ago in Holland,
