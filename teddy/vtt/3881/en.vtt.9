00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.523
Here you can see aquaponic systems

00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:32.727
that are actually
surrounding the astronauts,

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:38.219
so they're constantly in contact
with part of the food that they're eating.

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.695
Now, a very typical thing for this project

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:48.773
is that we run our own isolation missions
inside these art and design projects.

00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:51.747
We actually lock ourselves up
for multiple days on end,

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:53.447
and test what we build.

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:54.875
And this is, for example,

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.489
on the right hand side
you can see an isolation mission

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:00.407
in the Museum of Modern Art
in Ljubljana in Slovenia,
