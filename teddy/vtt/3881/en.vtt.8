00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.137
This was the last version that was just
presented a few weeks ago in Holland,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:07.282
which was using caravans 
as modules to build a starship.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.308
We bought some second-hand caravans,

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:10.605
cut them open,

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.342
and reassembled them into a starship.

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:16.249
Now, when we're thinking about starships,

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.287
we're not just approaching it
as a technological challenge.

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:22.215
We're really looking at it
as a combination of three systems:

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.596
ecology, people and technology.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:28.154
So there's always a strong ecological
component in the project.

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.523
