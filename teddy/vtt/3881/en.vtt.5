00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.956
This is not about, "Oh my God,
the world is going wrong

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:35.218
and we have to escape because we need
another future somewhere else."

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:36.499
No, no.

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.696
The project is basically inviting people

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:42.661
to take a step away
from earthbound constraints

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.319
and, as such, reimagine our future.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.003
And it's really helpful,
and it works really well,

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:52.260
so that's really the important part
of what we're doing.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.988
Now, in this project,
I'm using a cocreation approach,

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:59.078
which is a slightly different approach

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.580
from what you would expect
from many artists.
