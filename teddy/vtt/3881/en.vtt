00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.816
I am multidisciplinary.

00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:07.799
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander
for a NASA Mars simulation last year,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.718
and as an artist, I create multicultural
community art all over the planet.

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.622
And recently, I've actually
been combining both.

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.627
But let me first talk a little more
about that NASA mission.

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:23.240
This is the HI-SEAS program.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.936
HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded
planetary surface analogue

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:29.664
on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.690
and it's a research program
that is specifically designed
