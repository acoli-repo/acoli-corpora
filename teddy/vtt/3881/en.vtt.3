WEBVTT

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.033
But also we learned a lot.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.749
I learned a lot about
how individual crew members

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.419
actually cope with a situation like this;

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.926
how you can keep a crew
productive and happy,

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.526
for example, giving them
a good deal of autonomy

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.058
is a good trick to do that;

00:01:45.058 --> 00:01:48.047
and honestly, I learned
a lot about leadership,

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:49.935
because I was a crew commander.

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.839
So doing this mission,

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:56.725
I really started thinking more deeply
about our future in outer space.

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.394
We will venture into outer space,
and we will start inhabiting outer space.
