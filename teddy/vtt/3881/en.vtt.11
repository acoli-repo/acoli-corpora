It really does look like Mars
in certain locations

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.119
and has been used by NASA
to test equipment.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.222
And it has a long history
of being connected to space

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.977
through observations of the stars.

00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:43.645
It's now home to ALMA,

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.423
the large telescope
that's being developed there.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:51.143
But also, it's the driest
location on the planet,

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:54.144
and that makes it extremely interesting
to build our project,

00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:59.829
because suddenly, sustainability
is something we have to explore fully.

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.661
We have no other option,
