00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:00.942
We did extra-vehicular activities,
as you can see here,

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:02.986
wearing mock-up space suits,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.655
but we also had our chores
and lots of other stuff to do,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.907
like questionnaires
at the end of every day.

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.700
Busy, busy work.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.752
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.804
it's quite challenging to live
with just a small group of people

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:16.987
in a small space for a long time.

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:19.216
There's all kinds
of psychological challenges:

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:23.092
how to keep a team together
in these circumstances;

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.822
how to deal with the warping of time
you start to sense

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:28.015
when you're living in these circumstances;

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.949
sleep problems that arise; etc.

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.033
But also we learned a lot.
