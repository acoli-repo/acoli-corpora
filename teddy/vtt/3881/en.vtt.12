WEBVTT

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.661
We have no other option,

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.074
so I'm very curious to see
what's going to happen.

00:06:04.074 --> 00:06:08.231
Now, a specific thing for this
particular version of the project

00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:10.413
is that I'm very interested to see

00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:12.569
how we can connect
with the local population,

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.802
the native population.

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:16.544
These people have been living there
for a very long time

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:19.516
and can be considered
experts in sustainability,

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:22.487
and so I'm very interested
to see what we can learn from them,

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:25.819
and have an input of indigenous knowledge
into space exploration.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.598
So we're trying to redefine
how we look at our future in outer space
