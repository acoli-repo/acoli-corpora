and it's a research program
that is specifically designed

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.713
to study the effects
of long-term isolation of small crews.

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.601
I lived in this dome for four months
with a crew of six,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.386
a very interesting experience, of course.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:46.369
We did all kinds of research.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.821
Our main research
was actually a food study,

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:51.700
but apart from that food study --

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.488
developing a new food system
for astronauts living in deep space --

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.621
we also did all kinds of other research.

00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:00.942
We did extra-vehicular activities,
as you can see here,
