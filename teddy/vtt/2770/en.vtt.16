00:07:57.387 --> 00:08:01.325
and even though you're flying
2,000 feet above Manhattan,

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.937
you don't feel afraid.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:05.869
You feel triumphant for JR's character.

00:08:07.022 --> 00:08:08.501
The music guides you there.

00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.525
(Music)

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.971
Contrary to popular belief,

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.661
there is composition in virtual reality,

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:23.746
but it's completely
different than in film,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.495
where you have a rectangular frame.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:28.031
Composition is now
where your consciousness exists

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.002
and how the world moves around you.
