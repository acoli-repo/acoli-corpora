00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:03.293
When I was a kid,

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:05.825
I experienced something so powerful,

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.923
I spent the rest of my life
searching for it,

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.459
and in all the wrong places.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.920
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:15.816
It was music.

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.547
And this is where the story begins.

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:21.167
That's me,

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:23.137
listening to the Beatles' "White Album."

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:26.329
And the look on my face is the feeling

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.099
that I've been searching for ever since.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.524
Music goes straight to the emotional vein,
