00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.872
We are the equivalent
of year one of cinema.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.522
This is the Lumière Brothers film

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:06.905
that allegedly sent a theater full
of people running for their lives

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.222
as they thought a train
was coming toward them.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:13.412
Similar to this early stage
of this medium,

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:16.977
in VR, we also have to move
past the spectacle

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.887
and into the storytelling.

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.658
It took this medium decades

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:23.340
to figure out its preferred
language of storytelling,

00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:25.140
in the form of a feature film.

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:28.518
In VR today, we're more learning grammar

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:29.833
than writing language.
