00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.937
you could surf gravitational waves
on the edge of a black hole,

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:34.737
or create galaxies from scratch,

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.845
or communicate with each other
not using words

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.772
but using our raw thoughts?

00:11:41.254 --> 00:11:43.335
That's not a virtual reality anymore.

00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:46.398
And honestly I don't know
what that's called.

00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:49.216
But I hope you see where we're going.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:54.351
But here I am, intellectualizing
a medium I'm saying is experiential.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.265
So let's experience it.

00:11:56.845 --> 00:12:00.040
In your hands, you hopefully hold
a piece of cardboard.
