Film has been a sequence of rectangles,

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:34.934
from Muybridge and his horses to now.

00:10:35.377 --> 00:10:36.927
The format has never changed.

00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:41.101
But VR as a format, as a medium,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.619
isn't complete yet.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:47.966
It's not using physical celluloid
or paper or TV signals.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.809
It actually employs what we use
to make sense of the world.

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:56.545
We're using your senses
as the paints on the canvas,

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:57.891
but only two right now.

00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:03.493
Eventually, we can see if we will have
all of our human senses employed,
