00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.426
We were pushing beyond the screen,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.431
trying to connect more deeply

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.832
to people's hearts and imaginations.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.091
But it wasn't quite enough.

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:14.057
It still didn't have the raw
experiential power of pure music for me.

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:17.504
So I started chasing a new technology

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:20.227
that I only had read about
in science fiction.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:23.235
And after years of searching,
I found a prototype.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:28.095
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña
in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.

00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:32.170
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
