Next time you hear someone
singing over your shoulder,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.171
it might be Bono.

00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:33.402
(Laughter)

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:41.294
VR makes us feel
like we are part of something.

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.968
For most of human history,
we lived in small family units.

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:47.503
We started in caves,

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.960
then moved to clans and tribes,
then villages and towns,

00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:53.676
and now we're all global citizens.

00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:58.011
But I believe that we are still
hardwired to care the most

00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:00.532
about the things that are local to us.
