00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.398
In fact, it's going to be the last one.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.005
I mean this because it's the first medium
that actually makes the jump

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.317
from our internalization
of an author's expression

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:10.011
of an experience,

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:12.687
to our experiencing it firsthand.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.855
You look confused.
I'll explain. Don't worry.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.273
(Laughter)

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.020
If we go back to the origins of mediums,

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:22.408
by all best guesses,

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:25.398
it starts around a fire,
with a good story.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.451
Our clan leader is telling us

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.104
about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
on the tundra that day.
