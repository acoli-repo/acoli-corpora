00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.104
about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
on the tundra that day.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.408
We hear his words

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.363
and translate them
into our own internal truths.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.004
The same thing happens

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.670
when we look at the cave painting
version of the story,

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.824
the book about the mammoth hunt,

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:47.706
the play,

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.295
the radio broadcast,

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:50.914
the television show

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:52.737
or the movie.

00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:57.264
All of these mediums require
what we call "suspension of disbelief,"

00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:01.346
because there's a translation gap
between the reality of the story
