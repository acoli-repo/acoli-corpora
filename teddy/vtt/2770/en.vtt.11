(Laughter)

00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:35.830
So here's what special about VR.

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.305
In all other mediums,

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.599
your consciousness interprets the medium.

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:45.214
In VR, your consciousness is the medium.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.833
So the potential for VR is enormous.

00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:50.531
But where are we now?

00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:53.141
What is the current state of the art?

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:55.468
Well,

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:57.935
we are here.

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.872
We are the equivalent
of year one of cinema.
