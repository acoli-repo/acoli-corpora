We've made 15 films in the last year
at our VR company, Vrse,

00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:36.072
and we've learned a few things.

00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.116
We found that we have a unique,
direct path into your senses,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.949
your emotions, even your body.

00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:45.572
So let me show you some things.

00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:46.994
For the purpose of this demo,

00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:50.083
we're going to take every direction
that you could possibly look,

00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:52.320
and stretch it into this giant rectangle.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.033
OK, here we go.

00:06:57.642 --> 00:07:01.923
So, first: camera movement
is tricky in VR.
