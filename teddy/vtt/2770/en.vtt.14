00:06:57.642 --> 00:07:01.923
So, first: camera movement
is tricky in VR.

00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.049
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.429
We found if you move the camera
at a constant speed in a straight line,

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:11.670
you can actually get away with it, though.

00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:13.421
The first day in film school,

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.032
they told me you have to learn
every single rule

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.814
before you can break one.

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.012
We have not learned every single rule.

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.564
We've barely learned any at all,

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:23.405
but we're already trying to break them

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:25.958
to see what kind of creative things
we can accomplish.

00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:29.694
In this shot here, where we're moving up
off the ground, I added acceleration.

00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:32.551
I did that because I wanted
to give you a physical sensation
