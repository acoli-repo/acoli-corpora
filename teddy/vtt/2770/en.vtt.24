In your hands, you hopefully hold
a piece of cardboard.

00:12:01.143 --> 00:12:02.776
Let's open the flap.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.333
Tap on the power button
to unlock the phone.

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:07.769
For the people watching at home,

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.629
we're going to put up a card right now

00:12:09.653 --> 00:12:12.883
to show you how to download
this experience on your phone yourself,

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:16.208
and even get a Google cardboard
of your own to try it with.

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:19.802
We played in cardboard boxes as kids,

00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:24.410
and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find
a little bit of that lightning

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:27.208
by sticking our head in one again.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.044
