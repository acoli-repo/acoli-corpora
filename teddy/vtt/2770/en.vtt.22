Eventually, we can see if we will have

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:07.712
and we will have agency to live
the story in any path we choose.

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:11.031
And we call it virtual reality right now,

00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:13.849
but what happens when we move
past simulated realities?

00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:16.775
What do we call it then?

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:20.339
What if instead of verbally
telling you about a dream,

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.137
I could let you live inside that dream?

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.487
What if instead of just experiencing
visiting some reality on Earth,

00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.937
you could surf gravitational waves
on the edge of a black hole,
