between the reality of the story

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.792
and our consciousness

into our reality.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.157
I'm using the word "consciousness"
as a feeling of reality that we get

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:14.517
from our senses experiencing
the world around us.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.377
Virtual reality bridges that gap.

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:26.576
Or you are the clan leader.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.302
Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:30.961
