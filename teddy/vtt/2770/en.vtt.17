00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.002
and how the world moves around you.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.291
In this film, "Waves of Grace,"
which was a collaboration between Vrse,

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:37.224
the United Nations, Gabo Arora,
and Imraan Ismail,

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:40.490
we also see the changing role
of the close-up in virtual reality.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:45.352
A close-up in VR means
you're actually close up to someone.

00:08:45.954 --> 00:08:48.597
It brings that character inside
of your personal space,

00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.466
a space that we'd usually reserve
for the people that we love.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.660
And you feel an emotional
closeness to the character

00:08:55.684 --> 00:08:58.392
because of what you feel
to be a physical closeness.
