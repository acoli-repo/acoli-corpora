00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.492
In both, I'm searching
for the same thing, though,

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:07.175
to capture that lightning in a bottle.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:09.865
Except, I'm not.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.448
Adding moving pictures over the music
added narrative dimension, yes,

00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.785
but never quite equated the power

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.553
that just raw music had for me on its own.

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.949
This is not a great thing to realize
when you've devoted your life

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.812
and professional career
to becoming a music video director.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:29.137
I kept asking myself,
did I take the wrong path?
