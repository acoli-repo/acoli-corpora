00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:00.532
about the things that are local to us.

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:06.283
And VR makes anywhere
and anyone feel local.

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:08.815
That's why it works as an empathy machine.

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:12.063
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra"
takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:16.638
and instead of watching a story
about people over there,

00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:20.485
it's now a story about us here.

00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:23.896
But where do we go from here?

00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:26.889
The tricky thing is that
with all previous mediums,

00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:29.283
the format is fixed at its birth.
