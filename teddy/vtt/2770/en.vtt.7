00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.984
It was called virtual reality.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.303
This was it five years ago
when I ran into it.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.592
This is what it looks like now.

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:48.751
I quickly started building things
in this new medium,

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.992

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:56.820
in the history of mediums.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.398
In fact, it's going to be the last one.
