00:00:01.746 --> 00:00:07.288
I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia,
and I didn't know very many white people,

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.829
but I was raised
in a Southern Black church

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.163
that was under the shadow
of white supremacy

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:14.496
and run by Black people

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:17.454
who in many ways were taught
to hate themselves.

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:24.121
The generation that raised me
was still familiar with lynchings.

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:26.579
So in order to not be murdered by racists,

00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:29.288
some of the Black people
in the generation before me

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.621
learned to make themselves smaller.
