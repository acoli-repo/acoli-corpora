WEBVTT

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:31.955
was just beginning to face up to back then.

00:13:31.955 --> 00:13:34.375
It would be another 71 years

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.229
before the Endangered Species Act was passed,

00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:38.559
but really, here's its whole ethos

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.513
boiled down into something like a scene

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:42.859
you'd see in a stained glass window.

00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:45.851
The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.402
and the president of the United States

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:50.794
decided to show it some mercy.

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.440
Thank you.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.154
(Applause)

00:13:55.154 --> 00:13:57.567
