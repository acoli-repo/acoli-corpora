00:08:58.074 --> 00:09:00.980
called possum and taters.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.582
So you would have a whole opossum

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:04.947
roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:06.394
and then sometimes they'd leave

00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:09.878
the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:11.557
The one brought to Taft's table

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.742
weighed 18 pounds.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:17.446
So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.286
and the guests burst into song,

00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:20.910
and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.632
with the presentation of a gift

00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:24.524
from a group of local supporters,

00:09:24.524 --> 00:09:26.960
and this was a stuffed opossum toy,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.170
all beady-eyed and bald-eared,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.870
and it was a new product they were putting forward
