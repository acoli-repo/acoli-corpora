00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.364
into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,

00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:34.910

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.550
maybe some people deep down

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.616

America still hated the bear and feared it,

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:45.200

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.086

how do we think and feel about them,

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.063
and how do their reputations get written

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:58.319
and then rewritten in our minds?

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.163
We're here living in the eye of a great storm
