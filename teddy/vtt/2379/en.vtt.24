00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.663
riggging the world around them in their favor.

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:02.519
So we've gone hands-on

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:04.957
and we can't ever take our hands off,

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:06.850
and that's a hell of a lot of work.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.929
Right now, we're training condors

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.881
not to perch on power lines.

00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:14.594
We teach whooping cranes
to migrate south for the winter

00:12:14.594 --> 00:12:16.893
behind little ultra-light airplanes.

00:12:16.893 --> 00:12:20.202
We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.

00:12:20.202 --> 00:12:24.552
We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:27.869
So we've gone from annihilating species

00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:31.373
to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species
