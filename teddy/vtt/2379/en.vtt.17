00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:31.684
it was a sort of silly political novelty item

00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:33.926
and it would go away once the president left office,

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:37.723
and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,

00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:39.148
William Howard Taft,

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:40.556
was getting ready to be inaugurated,

00:08:40.556 --> 00:08:42.488
the toy industry was on the hunt

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:45.315
for the next big thing.

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.572
They didn't do too well.

00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:50.171
That January, Taft was the guest of honor

00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:51.610
at a banquet in Atlanta,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.479
and for days in advance,

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:54.924
the big news was the menu.

00:08:54.924 --> 00:08:56.010
They were going to be serving him

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.074
a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,

00:08:58.074 --> 00:09:00.980
called possum and taters.
