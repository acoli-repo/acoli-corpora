00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:31.373
to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species

00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:33.315
indefinitely, and which ones?

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:34.507
Well, the ones that we've told

00:12:34.507 --> 00:12:36.131
compelling stories about,

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:39.346
the ones we've decided ought to stick around.

00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:42.920
The line between conservation and domestication

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.945

they can be irrational

00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:52.766
or romanticized or sensationalized.

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:55.515
Sometimes they just have
nothing to do with the facts.

00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:58.765
But in a world of conservation reliance,

00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:00.971
those stories have very real consequences,
