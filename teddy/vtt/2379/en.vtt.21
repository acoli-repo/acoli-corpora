00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.586
didn't even make it to Christmastime,

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.626
which when you think about it is

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:35.475
a special sort of tragedy for a toy.

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.398
So we can explain that failure two ways.

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:39.588
The first, well, it's pretty obvious.

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:41.476
I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:

00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:44.337
Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)

00:10:44.337 --> 00:10:47.000
But maybe more importantly is that

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.690
the story of the billy possum was all wrong,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.221
especially compared

00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:53.302
to the backstory of the teddy bear.

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:55.544
Think about it: for most of
human's evolutionary history,

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:57.869
what's made bears impressive to us

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:00.041
has been their complete independence from us.
