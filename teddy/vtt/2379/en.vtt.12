00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:01.270
For the first time, nearly a
majority of people lived in cities,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.706
so there was a growing distance
between us and nature.

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:05.498
There was a safe space where we could

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:08.172
reconsider the bear and romanticize it.

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:10.906
Nature could only start to
seem this pure and adorable

00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:13.660
because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.185
And you can see that cycle playing out

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:17.347
again and again with all kinds of animals.

00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:19.223
It seems like we're always stuck between

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:21.630
demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.210
and then when we get very close to doing that,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.747
empathizing with it as an underdog

00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:28.272
and wanting to show it compassion.

00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:30.070
So we exert our power,
