Essentially, toymakers took
the bear from the cartoon,

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:33.203
turned it into a plush toy, and then named it

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.397
after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear.

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:38.541
And I do feel a little ridiculous

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.476
that I'm up here on this stage

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.894
and I'm choosing to use my time

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.162
to tell you about a 100-year-old story

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:48.260
about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.220
but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.181
inside that story is a more important story,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.409
a story about how dramatically our ideas

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.005
about nature can change,

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.345
and also about how, on the planet right now,
