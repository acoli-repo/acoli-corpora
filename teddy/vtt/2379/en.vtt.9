00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.892
the more television a person
watches in Upstate New York,

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:33.545
the more he or she is afraid

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.242
of being attacked by a black bear.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.030
If you show a tiger to an American,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.140
they're much more likely to assume that it's female

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.400
and not male.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.168
In a study where a fake snake

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:45.153
and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.405
drivers hit the snake much
more often than the turtle,

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:49.469
and about three percent of
drivers who hit the fake animals

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.747
seemed to do it on purpose.

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:54.337
Women are more likely than men to get a

00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:57.372
"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.

00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:59.184
Sixty-eight percent of mothers with

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.564
"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"
