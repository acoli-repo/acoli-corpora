We're here living in the eye of a great storm

00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:04.015
of extinction where half the species on the planet

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.167
could be gone by the end of the century,

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.701
and so why is it that we come to care about

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:10.571
some of those species and not others?

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.701
Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.147
of social science that started looking at

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:16.315
these questions and trying to unpack the powerful

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.047
and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:20.168
that we have to animals,

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.609
and I spent a lot of time looking through

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.633
their academic journals,

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.439
and all I can really say is that their findings

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.425
are astonishingly wide-ranging.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:29.251
So some of my favorites include that

00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.892
the more television a person
