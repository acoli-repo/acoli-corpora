00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.519
So it was the fall of 1902,

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.437
and President Theodore Roosevelt

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:07.217
needed a little break from the White House,

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:09.595
so he took a train to Mississippi

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:11.723
to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:13.910
called Smedes.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.970
The first day of the hunt,
they didn't see a single bear,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.490
so it was a big bummer for everyone,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.334
but the second day, the dogs cornered one

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.734
after a really long chase, but by that point,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:24.178
the president had given up

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.920
and gone back to camp for lunch,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.531
so his hunting guide cracked the animal

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.199
on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,
