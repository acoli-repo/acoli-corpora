00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:00.971
those stories have very real consequences,

00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.399
because now, how we feel about an animal

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.029
affects its survival

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:07.389
more than anything that you read about

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:09.438
in ecology textbooks.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:11.840
Storytelling matters now.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.373
Emotion matters.

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:19.025
Our imagination has become an ecological force.

00:13:19.025 --> 00:13:20.962
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part

00:13:20.962 --> 00:13:23.653
because the legend of Roosevelt

00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:25.708
and that bear in Mississippi

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.168
was kind of like an allegory

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:29.261
of this great responsibility that society

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:31.955
was just beginning to face up to back then.
