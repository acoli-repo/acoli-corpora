00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:00.776
and then it's also being eaten simultaneously

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:03.480
by a lobster and a shark.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.192
This one came from a kid named Fritz,

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.886
and he's actually got a solution to climate change.

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:08.732
He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.

00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:11.382
He says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.

00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:13.494
I like polar bears.

00:07:13.494 --> 00:07:19.280
Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.275
So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.583
writing about polar bears leaping into their boats

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:25.826
and trying to devour them,

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:27.493
even if they lit the bear on fire,

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:29.673
but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:31.463
and actually they don't even see the polar bear
