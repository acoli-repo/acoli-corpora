00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.418
the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.177
that people were encountering on the frontier,

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.545
and the federal government was actually

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.830
systematically exterminating bears

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.083
and lots of other predators too,

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.933
like coyotes and wolves.

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.781
These animals, they were being demonized.

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.079
They were called murderers

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.235
because they killed people's livestock.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.773
One government biologist, he explained this

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.953
war on animals like the bear by saying

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.343
that they no longer had a place

00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:55.589
in our advancing civilization,

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.317
and so we were just clearing them out of the way.

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.083
In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves
