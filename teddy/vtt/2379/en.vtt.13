00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:30.070
So we exert our power,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.514
but then we're unsettled

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:34.289
by how powerful we are.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.413
So for example, this is one of

00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:39.050
probably thousands of letters and drawings

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.594
that kids sent to the Bush administration,

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:42.305
begging it to protect the polar bear

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:43.572
under the Endangered Species Act,

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.080
and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.233
when awareness of climate
change was suddenly surging.

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.562
We kept seeing that image of a polar bear

00:06:49.562 --> 00:06:50.980
stranded on a little ice floe

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.327
looking really morose.

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:54.091
I spent days looking through these files.

00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:56.250
I really love them. This one's my favorite.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.361
If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning

00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:00.776
and then it's also being eaten simultaneously
