00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.564
"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:04.209
identified with the dancing cats

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:06.674
in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:08.359
Americans consider lobsters

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:09.655
more important than pigeons

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:11.841
but also much, much stupider.

00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:14.837
Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly
more dangerous than sea otters,

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:20.010
and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.443
So some of this is physical, right?

00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:24.066
We tend to sympathize more
with animals that look like us,

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.696
and especially that resemble human babies,

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:27.123
so with big, forward-facing eyes

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:28.385
and circular faces,

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.119
kind of a roly-poly posture.
