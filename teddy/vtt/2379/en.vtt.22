00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:00.041
has been their complete independence from us.

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:02.626
It's that they live these parallel lives

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:05.131
as menaces and competitors.

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.486
By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:09.464
that stature was being crushed,

00:11:09.464 --> 00:11:11.702
and the animal that he had roped to a tree

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:14.003
really was a symbol for all bears.

00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:16.430

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.857
or the indifference of people.

00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:23.681
That said something really ominous

00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:26.363
about the future of bears,

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:29.500
but it also said something very 
unsettling about who we'd become,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.942
if the survival of even an animal like that
