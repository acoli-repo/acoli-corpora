00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.345
and also about how, on the planet right now,

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.441
the stories that we tell

00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.709
are dramatically changing nature.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.241
Because think about the teddy bear.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.746
For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.249
because bears are so cute and cuddly,

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.721
and who wouldn't want to give
one to their kids to play with,

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.253
but the truth is that in 1902,

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:18.881
bears weren't cute and cuddly.

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:20.182
I mean, they looked the same,

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.315
but no one thought of them that way.

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.161
In 1902, bears were monsters.

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.485
Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:29.145
For generations at that point,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.418
the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger
