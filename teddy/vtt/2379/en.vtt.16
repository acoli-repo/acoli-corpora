00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.233
We were just getting around to

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:02.251
polishing off these last wild predators.

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.805
Now, society's reach has expanded

00:08:04.805 --> 00:08:06.865
all the way to the top of the world,

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:09.159
and it's made even these, the most remote,

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:11.191
the most powerful bears on the planet,

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:14.690
seem like adorable and blameless victims.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.581
But you know, there's also a
postscript to the teddy bear story

00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:19.218
that not a lot of people talk about.

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.001
We're going to talk about it,

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.174
because even though it didn't really take long

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:24.974
after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902

00:08:24.974 --> 00:08:26.951
for the toy to become a full-blown craze,

00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.452
most people figured it was a fad,

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:31.684
it was a sort of silly political novelty item
