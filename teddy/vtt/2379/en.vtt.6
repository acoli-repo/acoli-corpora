00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.083
In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.290
had been slaughtered.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.147
The grizzly would soon be wiped out

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:09.580
from 95 percent of its original territory,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.802
and whereas once there had been 30 million bison

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.420
moving across the plains, and you would have

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.128
these stories of trains having to stop

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.116
for four or five hours so that these thick,

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:21.444
living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:26.803
now, by 1902, there were maybe 
less than 100 left in the wild.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.840
And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.364
into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,
