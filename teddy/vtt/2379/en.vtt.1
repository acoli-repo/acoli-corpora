00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.199
on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.907
and then tied it up to a tree

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.519
and started tooting away on his bugle

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.558
to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.074
of shooting it.

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:41.431
The bear was a female.

00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.007
It was dazed, injured,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.654
severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.721
and when Roosevelt saw this animal

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.343
tied up to the tree,

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.142
he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:55.293
He felt like that would go against his code

00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:57.259
as a sportsman.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.960
A few days later, the scene was memorialized

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.995
in a political cartoon back in Washington.
