00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.995
in a political cartoon back in Washington.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.116
It was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:07.495
and it showed Roosevelt with
his gun down and his arm out,

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.132
sparing the bear's life,

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:10.658
and the bear was sitting on its hind legs

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:12.696
with these two big, frightened, wide eyes

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.826

sweep it up into your arms

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:19.250
and reassure it.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.716
It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.784
but if you go looking for the cartoon now,

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.520
you recognize the animal right away:

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.474
It's a teddy bear.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.095
And this is how the teddy bear was born.

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:31.603
Essentially, toymakers took
the bear from the cartoon,
