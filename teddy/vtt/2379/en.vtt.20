00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.214
the children of the United States

00:10:00.214 --> 00:10:03.446
will play with billy possum."

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:05.570
So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.038
There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,

00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:10.200
billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.930
There were smaller billy possums on a stick

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.872
that kids could wave around like flags.

00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:16.790
But even with all this marketing,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.820
the life of the billy possum

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.004
turned out to be just pathetically brief.

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:24.047
The toy was an absolute flop,

00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:25.626
and it was almost completely forgotten

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:26.994
by the end of the year,

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.086
and what that means is that the billy possum

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.586
didn't even make it to Christmastime,
