00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:31.891
Ever heard of that?

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.276
(Laughter)

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.021
It essentially means to replace
a damaged tooth

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.756
by an artificial one,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.669
that is screwed into your jaw.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:46.616
Estimated costs for the implant surgery
may add up to 10,000 US dollars.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.093
Replacing the ceramic inlay I had before

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.050
would come in at 100 US dollars.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.017
Was it my health or the money
that could be earned with me

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.767
that was the biggest concern
for my dentist?
