to fall sick of an identified,
individual high-risk disease.

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:37.538
Artificial intelligence-based
data analysis

00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:39.712
and the miniaturization
of sensor technologies

00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:43.865
are already starting to make monitoring
of the individual health status possible.

00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:48.354
Measuring cardiometabolic parameters
by devices like this

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:52.649
or the detection of circulating
tumor DNA in your bloodstream

00:06:52.673 --> 00:06:54.998
early on after cancer disease onset

00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:58.018
are only two examples
for such monitoring technologies.

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:00.234
