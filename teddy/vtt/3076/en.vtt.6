00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.405
of our health care
system's architecture --

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.302
a complete rethinking
of the incentive structure.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.458
What we may need is a health care system

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:10.545
that reimburses practitioners
for keeping their customers healthy

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.018
instead of almost only paying for services
once people are already sick.

00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:18.491
What we may need is a transformation

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:22.195
from today's system
that largely cares for the sick,

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.503
to a system that cares for the healthy.

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:29.426
To change our current "sick care" approach

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.742
into a true "health care" approach.
