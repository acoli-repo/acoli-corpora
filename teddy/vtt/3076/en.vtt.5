Although certain countries
started to implement

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:33.212
performance-based reimbursement,

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.102
anchored on a quality and efficacy matrix,

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:40.824
overall, there's very little in today's
health care systems' architecture

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.932
to incentivize practitioners broadly

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:46.548
to actively prevent the appearance
of a disease in the first place

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.134
and to limit the procedures
applied to a patient

00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:51.158
to the most effective options.

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:53.459
So how do we fix this?

00:02:55.452 --> 00:02:58.209
What it may take is a fundamental redesign

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.405
of our health care
system's architecture --
