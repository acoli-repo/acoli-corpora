00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:00.234
Take cancer.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:04.488
One of the biggest problems
in certain oncological diseases

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:08.815
is that a large number of patients
is diagnosed too late

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.466
to allow them to be cured,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.879
although the drugs and treatments
that could potentially have cured them

00:07:13.903 --> 00:07:15.720
are already existing today,

00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:18.232
if the disease had only
been detected earlier.

00:07:19.109 --> 00:07:23.085
New technologies allow now,
based on a few milliliters of blood,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.899
to detect the presence
of circulating tumor DNA

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:27.641
and thus, the presence of cancer,

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:30.032
early on in a really convenient manner.
