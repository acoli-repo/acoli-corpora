monitoring of lifetime health data

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.982
as well as genetic sequencing,
cardiometabolic profiling

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.006
and imaging-based technologies

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.624

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:27.061
for their diet, their medication
and their physical activity --

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:29.669
to diminish their unique probability

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:33.730
to fall sick of an identified,
individual high-risk disease.
