In effect, all players in the system

00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:05.752
are now responsible for keeping
their customers healthy,

00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:10.149
and they're incentivized to avoid
any unnecessary medical interventions

00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:14.929
by simply reducing the number of people
that eventually become sick.

00:05:16.743 --> 00:05:18.925
The more healthy people there are,

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:22.637
the less the cost
to treat the sick will be,

00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:27.299
and the higher the economic benefit
for all parties being involved

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:29.989
in keeping these individuals healthy is.
