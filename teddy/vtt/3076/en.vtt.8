00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.130
What if we redesign our health care system

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:06.012
into one that does not
reimburse practitioners

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.837
for the actual procedures
performed on a patient

00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.887
but rather reimburses doctors, hospitals,

00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:14.069
pharmaceutical and medical companies

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:17.086
for every day a single
individual is kept healthy

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.770
and doesn't develop a disease?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.188
In practical terms, we could, for example,

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:26.529
use public money to pay a health fee
to an insurance company

00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:29.056
for every day a single individual
is kept healthy

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.552
and doesn't develop a disease
