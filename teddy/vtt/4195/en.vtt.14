and the whole world.

MR: I have learnt from the sport cricket,

00:07:04.747 --> 00:07:09.057
when you experience highs and lows,
which are inevitable in life,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:11.759
when you go through a low phase,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.119
at that moment it’s important 
that you don’t lose faith in yourself.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.759
Because self-belief,
though a very small word,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.520
has a huge impact.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.810
Always have hope that one day 
you will turn it around for yourself.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.650
