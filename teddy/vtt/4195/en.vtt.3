00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:32.239
about the World Cup game where

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.439
we didn’t win against England 
in the finals

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.839
and how did you feel?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.150
I know one shouldn’t rub
salt on one’s wounds

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.520
if I ask this, but

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.930
She said, "It is part of the conversation."

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.420
Everyone asks you.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.680
MR: Everybody says the same thing,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.213
“We don’t mean to ask, 
but what really happened?”

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:52.913
(Laughter)

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:56.161
SRK: It’s too unfair. Even I don’t mean
to ask, but what happened?

00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:57.201
(Laughter)

00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.821
(Applause)

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:02.900
MR: This final is very different 
from the 2005 World Cup Final,
