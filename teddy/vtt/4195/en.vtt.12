00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.800
MR: Cricket is not gender biased.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.979
It isn’t that men’s cricket is different

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.569
and women’s a different one.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.279
When we talk about knowledge

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.799
or tactical plans,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.600
if a woman coach has the capability,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.040
then she should surely get an opportunity 
to coach the Indian men’s team.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.960
Finally all this is for a country.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.399
And if you have the best facilities

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.199
and support staff,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.183
then the team will do very well

00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:31.321
like it’s currently doing 
and will continue to do so in future.
