Since my childhood, I've always admired
people who do things differently.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.463
My first inspiration was
the musician Prince.

00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:11.463
Now, my mother, I think, thought he
was a little bit too different

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.030
because every time I was away,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.697
she discreetly turned that cover
of the Love Sexy album

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.263
on which Prince was very scarcely closed.

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:22.897
Now, later on, my love turned
to entrepreneurship,

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:27.697
disruption and innovation. And that
followed me throughout my career.

00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:31.463
And I read all of the stories
about those great innovators
