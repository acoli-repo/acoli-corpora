00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.107
we integrate from a vast variety of sources

00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:32.240
across a wide variety of data formats from very

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.549
disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:37.573
Instead, people will have to look at data

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:41.029
and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.714
the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:45.238
and as Kasparov realized,

00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:48.269
that means minimizing friction at the interface.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.027
Now this approach makes possible things like combing

00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:54.413
through all available data from very different sources,

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.205
identifying key relationships and putting them in one place,

00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:00.133
something that's been nearly impossible to do before.
