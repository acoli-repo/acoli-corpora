00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:31.420
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.673
fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference

00:06:33.673 --> 00:06:36.218
between success and failure.

00:06:36.218 --> 00:06:38.439
There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.014
adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a

00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:43.750
repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.743
Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,

00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:50.478
and increasingly these problems are buried in big data.

00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.978
For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:55.030
in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.124
what you might see on TV, these adaptations,

00:06:58.124 --> 00:07:00.417
and the detection of them, are fundamentally human.
