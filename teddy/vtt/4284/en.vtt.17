00:08:28.728 --> 00:08:30.662
on the Syrian border of Iraq.

00:08:30.662 --> 00:08:33.038
They found a treasure trove of documents:

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:35.373
700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.

00:08:35.373 --> 00:08:37.957
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.719

They answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"

"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.503
In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.903
The vast majority of foreign fighters

00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:02.303
were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --
