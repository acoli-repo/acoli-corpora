00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.148
determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:33.923
Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:37.158
We're terrible at scale, computation and volume.

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:38.994
We require high-end talent management

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:41.058
to keep the rock band together and playing.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.262
Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:46.538
that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:48.762
Silently, without much fanfare,

00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:52.116
this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.472
Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess —

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:58.514
there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.

00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:00.867
This is a world-changing problem with huge implications
