00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.617
When you put it all together, it's quite a computational

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:05.840
challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.932
the importance of the overall physical specifications

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:11.069
and the final aesthetics.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.684
When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat

00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:15.576
was given to an algorithm from the New York City

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:19.577
design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:22.448
While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,

00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:25.456
humans used that framework to design the final result.

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.681
So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:31.016
of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,
