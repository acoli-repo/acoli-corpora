00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.623
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.783
by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:37.798
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years

00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:40.424
was solved was by three players in a matter of days,

00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:42.449
perhaps the first major scientific advance

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.772
to come from playing a video game.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:46.953
Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers,

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:48.426
the 9/11 memorial opened.

00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:51.147
It displays the names of the thousands of victims

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.210
using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.376
It places the names next to each other based on their

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:58.589
relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.617
When you put it all together, it's quite a computational
