00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:31.016
of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:33.430
and kept track of a very large set of measurements

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.840
and variables, allowing the humans to focus

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.642
on design and compositional choices.

00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:39.678
So the more you look around you,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.640
the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.944
Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.914
human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.

00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:49.569
So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:50.998
what can you do?

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:53.450
You can start by designing the human into the process.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.654
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:59.523
design the solution around what the human will do as well.

00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:01.460
When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent
