00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:02.303
were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --

00:09:02.303 --> 00:09:06.641
hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:10.885
had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.943
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets

00:09:12.943 --> 00:09:15.685
of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:17.877
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful

00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:21.227
results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.445
and tenacity alone.

00:09:23.445 --> 00:09:25.398
The researchers had to lever up their human minds

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.743
with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious

00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:30.961
hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.
