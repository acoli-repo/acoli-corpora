00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:34.019
as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.870
At first, the results were predictable.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.367
Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.679
with a relatively weak laptop.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.664
The surprise came at the end. Who won?

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:46.440
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.933
but actually two American amateurs

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.755
using three relatively weak laptops.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.351
Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.786
to deeply explore specific positions

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:59.176
effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.785
of the grandmasters and the superior computational power
