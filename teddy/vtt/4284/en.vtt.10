00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:01.460
When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.339
all of your time on the interface between man and machine,

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.438
specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.

00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:10.204
In fact, this friction is more important than the power

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.256
of the man or the power of the machine

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:14.187
in determining overall capability.

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:16.164
That's why two amateurs with a few laptops

00:05:16.164 --> 00:05:18.620
handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.625
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.026
The better the process, the less the friction.

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:28.282
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.

00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.525
Or take another example: big data.
