00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.621
in making decisions, controlling complex situations

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.391
without the inflexible dependence

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.924
on predetermined programs.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.422
Note that word "cooperate."

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.169
Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.453
and make it Data from "Star Trek,"

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:15.988
but to take a human and make her more capable.

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:17.899
Humans are so amazing -- how we think,

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.517
our non-linear approaches, our creativity,

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:22.648
iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:23.993
for computers to do.

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.445
Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.772
setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.148
determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.
