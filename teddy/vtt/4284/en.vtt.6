00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:00.867
This is a world-changing problem with huge implications

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:03.175
for our ability to understand and treat disease.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:07.423
And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:09.807
Foldit, a game created by computer scientists,

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:12.309
illustrates the value of the approach.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.350
Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.423
in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,

00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:19.922
allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces

00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:22.879
and interactions and identify structural issues.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.902
This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:28.486
and tied 30 percent of the time.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.623
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery
