00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.068
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess.

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:06.932
The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:10.648
a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:12.888
To many, this was the dawn of a new era,

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.667
one where man would be dominated by machine.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.001
But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.691
in how we relate to computers is the iPad,

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.736
not HAL.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:26.384
The second game was a freestyle chess tournament

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.353
in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:34.019
as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.
