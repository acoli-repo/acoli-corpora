00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.217
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.915
of open platforms, and embedded technology,

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:38.307
I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:41.377
that was actually developed around the same time.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:44.709
I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.517
perhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.

00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:51.157
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound

00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:54.163
effect on the development of technology and the Internet.

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:57.031
His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate

00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.621
in making decisions, controlling complex situations
