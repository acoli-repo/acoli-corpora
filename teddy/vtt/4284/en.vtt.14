00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.709
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.349
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:24.950
data mine your way to the answer.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.805
There is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.107
we integrate from a vast variety of sources
