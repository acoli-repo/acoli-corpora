and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?

00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:02.818
The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:05.747
detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.

00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:08.258
There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk

00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:10.922
conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:13.880
The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.275
based on priority need.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:18.715
The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:21.299
information, social media data and relief organization

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:24.779
information to answer this question.

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.194
By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise

00:11:27.194 --> 00:11:29.802
a task for 40 people over three months became

00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:32.978
a simple job for three people in 40 hours,
