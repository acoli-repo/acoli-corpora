00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:30.961
hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.

00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.605
Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:36.573
50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:39.023
hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at

00:09:39.023 --> 00:09:41.406
three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure

00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:44.383
of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.014
a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.678
In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:53.144
a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.

00:09:53.144 --> 00:09:56.250
Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.323
by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were

00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:01.223
able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria
