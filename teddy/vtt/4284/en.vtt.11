00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.525
Or take another example: big data.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.431
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.490
by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.863
your credit card, your computer. The result is big data,

00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:39.605
and it actually presents us with an opportunity

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.267
to more deeply understand the human condition.

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.572
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:46.787
focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:49.063
this data? How do I process this data?"

00:05:49.063 --> 00:05:51.267
These are necessary but insufficient questions.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.738
The imperative is not to figure out how to compute,

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:55.922
but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.713
on data at this scale?

00:05:57.713 --> 00:06:01.212
Again, we start by designing the human into the process.
