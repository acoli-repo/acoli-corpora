00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.785
of the grandmasters and the superior computational power

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.694
of other adversaries.

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:06.599
This is an astonishing result: average men,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.680
average machines beating the best man, the best machine.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.879
And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.031
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.888
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:24.130
vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.392
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:29.145
It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.217
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,
