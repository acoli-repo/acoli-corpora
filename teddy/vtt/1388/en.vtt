00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:02.827
I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.013
about a whole new way to think
about sexual activity

00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:11.086
and sexuality education, by comparison.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.752
If you talk to someone today in America

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.576
about sexual activity,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.224
you'll find pretty soon
you're not just talking

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:20.882
about sexual activity.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.928
You're also talking about baseball.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:28.162
Because baseball is the dominant
cultural metaphor

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.680
that Americans use to think about
