00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:32.793
and well-trained police
to protect other peoples' neighborhoods.

00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:36.206
But, of course,
that's not going to do any good

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.365
if the government is stealing the money
or fueling the violence,

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:43.281
and so we also need better politicians
with better incentives.

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:47.186
The fact is, we actually know a lot
about what it takes to reduce violence.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.464
It's policies like putting more cops

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:52.314
in the few places
where most violence occurs.

00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:56.331
But they don't fit easily into the boxes
of the Left or the Right,

00:12:56.355 --> 00:13:00.173
and so you need really honest politicians
