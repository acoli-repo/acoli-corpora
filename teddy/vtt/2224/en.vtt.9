Now, pretty soon, good cops leave,

00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:36.174
and many that remain become brutal.

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:40.176
They start off, usually,
with rough justice.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.928
They kill a drug dealer that they think
would be let off by the corrupt courts.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.743
But over time, the worst of them realize
that there will be no repercussions

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:52.413
from the politicians they're in bed with,

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:54.617
and they go into business for themselves.

00:04:55.443 --> 00:05:00.022
In Venezuela, nearly one in three murders
is by the security services.
