00:04:55.443 --> 00:05:00.022
In Venezuela, nearly one in three murders
is by the security services.

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:05.278
Now, the poor are hit hardest
by violence all over the world,

00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:08.469
but they're hardly going to turn
to such predatory cops for help.

00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:11.572
So they tend to form vigilante groups.

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:13.819
But arm a bunch of 18-year-old boys,

00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:16.500
and pretty soon, they devolve
into gangs over time.

00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:19.771
Other gangs come in, mafias come in,

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:23.723
and they offer to protect people
from the other criminals

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:25.500
and from the police.

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.520
Unlike the state,

00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:29.766
the criminals often try to buy legitimacy.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.203
They give charity. They solve disputes.
