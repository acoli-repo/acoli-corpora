00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:30.099
My research assistant and I mapped places

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:33.059
based on how well they delivered
on World Bank projects

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.232
and whether they could get
public services to their people,

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.352
and if you did well on both of those,

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:42.089
if you could get sanitation
and electricity to your people

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:43.486
and deliver vaccines,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.705
you were in the upper right-hand quadrant.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.428
And then we overlaid that

00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:50.340
with a map of places
where journalists were being murdered.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.751
Some were happening in weak states,

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:55.282
but an awful lot of journalists
were being killed

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:57.909
in places plenty capable
of protecting them.

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.682
I traveled to every
settled continent on earth,
