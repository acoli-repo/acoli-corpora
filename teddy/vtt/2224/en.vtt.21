00:10:29.427 --> 00:10:32.681
The most important thing we can do
is abandon the notion

00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:35.664
that some lives are just
worth less than others,

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:38.920
that someone deserves
to be raped or murdered,

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:40.971
because after all, they did something,

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:44.082
they stole or they did something
to land themselves in prison

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:45.762
where that kind of thing happens.

00:10:46.836 --> 00:10:49.860
This devaluing of human life,

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:53.631

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:56.250

00:10:56.932 --> 00:11:00.344
It's what allows a bullet
shot in a gang war in Rio
