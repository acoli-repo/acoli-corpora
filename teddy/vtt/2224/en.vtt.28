00:13:55.953 --> 00:14:00.017
(Applause)

00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:01.848
But until then,

00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:05.072
if you're booking a place
in a dangerous country,

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:07.422
whether that's Jamaica or New Orleans,

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.693
do a little web research,

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.575
see if you can see any criminal ties.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:11.798
And, to make that easier,

00:14:11.822 --> 00:14:13.382
support legislation

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:16.419
that makes our financial systems
more transparent --

00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:19.019
things like banning anonymous
company ownership.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.929
Now, this all probably sounds
pretty quixotic,

00:14:22.953 --> 00:14:24.808
kind of like recycling your cans,

00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:28.497
just a tiny drop in the ocean
of a gigantic problem,

00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:30.401
but that's actually a misconception.
