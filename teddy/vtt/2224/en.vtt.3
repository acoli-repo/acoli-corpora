00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:31.003
violence in our democracies
is our problem.

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:35.345
And while regular voters
are a big part of that problem,

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429
we're also key to the solution.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:39.605
Now, I work at a think tank,

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:41.843
the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace,

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.534
where I advise governments
on what to do about violence,

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:46.395
but the dirty secret is,

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:50.554
most policymakers haven't figured out
these changes to violence today.

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.769
They still believe that the worst violence
happens in countries at war

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:57.428
or places that are too poor, too weak,

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:59.923
to fight violence and control crime.

00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:02.246
And that had been my assumption too.
