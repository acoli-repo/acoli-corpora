00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:02.246
And that had been my assumption too.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.755
But if you look at a map
of the most violent places on earth,

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:08.403
you see something strange.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.813
Some of them are at war,

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:13.665
and a few are truly failed states.

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.674
The violence in these places is horrific,

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:17.994
but they happen to have small populations,

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.150
so it actually affects few people.

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:23.213
Then there's South Africa,
Brazil, Venezuela.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:24.942
These places are not poor.

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.256
Maybe they're weak.

00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:30.099
My research assistant and I mapped places
