00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:01.567
Today, you are more likely
to die violently

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.677
if you live in a middle-income democracy

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.067
with high levels of income inequality

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:09.809
and serious political polarization.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.400
The United States has four
of the 50 most violent cities on earth.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:21.774
Now, this is a fundamental alteration
in the nature of violence, historically.

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:23.823
But it's also an opportunity.

00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:27.479
Because while few people
can do much to end war,

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:31.003
violence in our democracies
is our problem.
