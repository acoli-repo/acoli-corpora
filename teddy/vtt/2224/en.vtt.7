00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:31.272
Drug cartels would finance
their campaigns.

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:33.979
Organized criminals
would help them get out the vote.

00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.433
Gangs would suppress the vote.

00:03:35.457 --> 00:03:38.424
And in exchange,
they'd be given free reign,

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:39.987
and violence would grow.

00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:42.487
Take Venezuela.

00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.885
It's the most violent country
in the world today,

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.615
if you look at deaths per capita.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:50.851
Twenty years ago, the current regime
gained power in legitimate elections,

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.677
but they didn't want to risk losing it,

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:57.097
and so they turned to gangs,
called "colectivos," for help.

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:01.725
The gangs were told
to get out the vote for the government
