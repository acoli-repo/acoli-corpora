00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:01.725
The gangs were told
to get out the vote for the government

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.878
and force people to vote for the regime
in some neighborhoods

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:07.577
and keep opposition voters
away from the polls in others,

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.384
and, in exchange, they'd be given control.

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:13.236
But if criminals have control,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.550
then police and courts
can't do their jobs.

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:18.864
So the second stage in privilege violence

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:21.222
is that courts and police are weakened,

00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:23.944
and politicians politicize budgets,

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:25.404
hiring, firing,

00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:29.666
so that they and the violent groups
that they collude with stay out of jail.
