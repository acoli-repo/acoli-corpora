00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.682
I traveled to every
settled continent on earth,

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:05.746
comparing places that had faced
massive violence and recovered

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.072
and those that hadn't,

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:09.369
and I kept seeing the same pattern.

00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:11.681
I came to call it "privilege violence,"

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:15.662
because it happened
in highly unequal democracies,

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:17.132
where a small group of people

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:20.893
wanted to hold on
to inordinate power and privilege.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.545
And if they didn't think they could
get those policies past the voters,

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.793
sometimes they would turn
to violent groups for help.

00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:31.272
Drug cartels would finance
their campaigns.
