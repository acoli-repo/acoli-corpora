00:10:56.932 --> 00:11:00.344
It's what allows a bullet
shot in a gang war in Rio

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.971
to lodge in the head
of a two-year-old girl

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.733
climbing on a jungle gym nearby.

00:11:06.017 --> 00:11:10.568
And it's what allows a SWAT team
hunting for a meth dealer in Georgia

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:15.931
to throw a flash bang grenade
into the crib of a little boy,

00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:19.819
exploding near his face
and maiming him for life.

00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.723
The fact is, most violence everywhere

00:11:23.747 --> 00:11:25.939
happens to people
on the wrong side of town

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:27.580
at the wrong time,

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.731
and some of those people
are from communities

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.835
that we consider quite different.
