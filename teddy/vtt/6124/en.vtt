Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Hi, Roz Brewer.

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:04.785
Thanks so much for being with us today.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:06.794
Rosalind Brewer: Thank you for having me.

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:08.300
WPR: We can just dive right in.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.579
We're right now
in the last quarter of 2020,

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:15.546
and I think that a lot of people
would agree that we're in the midst

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.236
of what's probably one of the largest
reckonings around racial equity

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.520
that we've had in this country in decades.

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:25.372
And it's something that you've been
such a vocal advocate for,

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.015
both through your role at Starbucks

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.305
and throughout your career of diversity
and inclusion in the workplace.
