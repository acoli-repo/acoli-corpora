“Alii” from Palau,

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.316
my beautiful island home

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:06.476
in the western Pacific Ocean.

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:10.196
We Palauans have been here
for over 3,000 years,

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:15.556
living in harmony with nature
in our pristine paradise environment.

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:18.676
Palau is home to just 20,000 people,

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:24.396
but we are a large ocean state
with more than 300 islands,

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:27.796
covering an area the size of France.

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:30.556
Some of our islands are coral atolls,
