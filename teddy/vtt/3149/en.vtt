00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:02.988
If there's one city in the world

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:05.345
where it's hard to find
a place to buy or rent,

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:06.519
it's Sydney.

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:09.410
And if you've tried
to find a home here recently,

00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:11.274
you're familiar with the problem.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:13.312
Every time you walk into an open house,

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:15.527
you get some information
about what's out there

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:16.944
and what's on the market,

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.398
but every time you walk out,

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.636
you're running the risk
of the very best place passing you by.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
So how do you know when
to switch from looking

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:26.066
to being ready to make an offer?

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:30.064
This is such a cruel and familiar problem
