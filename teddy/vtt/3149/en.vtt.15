They've tried things like choosing
something at random

00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:34.154
or applying what's called
the "first-in, first-out principle,"

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:35.577
which means removing the item

00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.777
which has been in the memory
for the longest.

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.804
But the strategy that's most effective

00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:44.057
focuses on the items
which have been least recently used.

00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:48.163
This says if you're going to decide
to remove something from memory,

00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:53.155
you should take out the thing which was
last accessed the furthest in the past.

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.338
And there's a certain
kind of logic to this.

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:58.960
If it's been a long time since you last
accessed that piece of information,

00:07:58.984 --> 00:08:00.746
it's probably going to be a long time
