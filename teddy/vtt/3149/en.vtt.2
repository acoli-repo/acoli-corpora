00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.538
We know this because
trying to find a place to live

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.887
is an example of an optimal
stopping problem.

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.394
A class of problems that has been
studied extensively

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:07.523
by mathematicians and computer scientists.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.021
I'm a computational cognitive scientist.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.005
I spend my time trying to understand

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:15.827
how it is that human minds work,

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.522
from our amazing successes
to our dismal failures.

00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:23.045
To do that, I think about
the computational structure

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.728
of the problems
that arise in everyday life,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.127
and compare the ideal
solutions to those problems

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.898
to the way that we actually behave.
