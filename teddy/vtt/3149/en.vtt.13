00:06:27.272 --> 00:06:30.471
Is it a duplicate
of something that I already own?

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.906
And when was the last time
I wore it or used it?"

00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:36.363
But there's another group of experts

00:06:36.387 --> 00:06:39.517
who perhaps thought
even harder about this problem,

00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:43.201
and they would say one of these questions
is more important than the others.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:44.969
Those experts?

00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:48.129
The people who design
the memory systems of computers.

00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:50.407
Most computers have
two kinds of memory systems:

00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:51.818
a fast memory system,

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:55.011
like a set of memory chips
that has limited capacity,

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:57.087
because those chips are expensive,

00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.371
and a slow memory system,
which is much larger.
