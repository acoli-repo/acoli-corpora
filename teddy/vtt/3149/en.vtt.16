00:07:58.984 --> 00:08:00.746
it's probably going to be a long time

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.962
before you're going to need
to access it again.

00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:06.561
Your wardrobe is just like
the computer's memory.

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:08.615
You have limited capacity,

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:13.966
and you need to try and get in there
the things that you're most likely to need

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.409
so that you can get to them
as quickly as possible.

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:18.167
Recognizing that,

00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:21.004
maybe it's worth applying
the least recently used principle

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:22.977
to organizing your wardrobe as well.

00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:25.083
So if we go back
to Martha's four questions,

00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:27.968
the computer scientists
would say that of these,

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:29.933
the last one is the most important.
