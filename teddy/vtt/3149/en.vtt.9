00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:31.913
the first question you should ask yourself

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.116
is how much longer
you're going to be in town.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:36.847
If you're just going to be there
for a short time,

00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:38.386
then you should exploit.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.315
There's no point gathering information.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.387
Just go to a place
you already know is good.

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.340
But if you're going to be there
for a longer time, explore.

00:04:45.364 --> 00:04:47.751
Try something new,
because the information you get

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:50.749
is something that can improve
your choices in the future.

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:52.752
The value of information increases

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:55.376
the more opportunities
you're going to have to use it.

00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:57.947
This principle can give us insight

00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.041
into the structure
of a human life as well.
