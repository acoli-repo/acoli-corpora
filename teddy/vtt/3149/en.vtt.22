00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:02.266
But that's the best that you can do.

00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:05.898
Ultimately, computer science
can help to make us more forgiving

00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:07.831
of our own limitations.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.872
You can't control outcomes,
just processes.

00:11:10.896 --> 00:11:13.015
And as long as you've used
the best process,

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.802
you've done the best that you can.

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:18.514
Sometimes those best processes
involve taking a chance --

00:11:18.538 --> 00:11:20.653
not considering all of your options,

00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:23.406
or being willing to settle
for a pretty good solution.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.780
These aren't the concessions
that we make when we can't be rational --

00:11:26.804 --> 00:11:28.433
they're what being rational means.

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:29.984
Thank you.
