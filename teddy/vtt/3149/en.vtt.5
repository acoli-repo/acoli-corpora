00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:32.459
Whether it's as basic as trying to decide
what restaurant to go to

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:36.538
or as important as trying to decide
who to spend the rest of your life with,

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:38.937
human lives are filled
with computational problems

00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:43.157
that are just too hard to solve
by applying sheer effort.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.816
For those problems,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.801
it's worth consulting the experts:

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:47.976
computer scientists.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.784
(Laughter)

00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:51.627
When you're looking for life advice,

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.291
computer scientists probably aren't
the first people you think to talk to.

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.190
Living life like a computer --

00:02:57.214 --> 00:02:59.792
stereotypically deterministic,
exhaustive and exact --

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:01.368
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
