00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:30.634
and you're going to face
exactly the same decision tomorrow.

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:31.809
In that situation,

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.128
you run up against
what computer scientists call

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.524
the "explore-exploit trade-off."

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.449
You have to make a decision

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:40.807
about whether you're going
to try something new --

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.014
exploring, gathering some information

00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:45.323
that you might be able
to use in the future --

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:49.140
or whether you're going to go to a place
that you already know is pretty good --

00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:52.167
exploiting the information
that you've already gathered so far.

00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:56.584
The explore/exploit trade-off
shows up any time you have to choose

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:57.958
between trying something new

00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:00.962
and going with something
that you already know is pretty good,
