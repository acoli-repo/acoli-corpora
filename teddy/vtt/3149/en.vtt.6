00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:01.368
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:05.080
But thinking about the computer science
of human decisions

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:07.512
reveals that in fact,
we've got this backwards.

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:09.734
When applied to the sorts
of difficult problems

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:10.997
that arise in human lives,

00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.748
the way that computers
actually solve those problems

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:16.668
looks a lot more like the way
that people really act.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:20.189
Take the example of trying to decide
what restaurant to go to.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.178
This is a problem that has
a particular computational structure.

00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:25.726
You've got a set of options,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.799
you're going to choose
one of those options,

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:30.634
and you're going to face
exactly the same decision tomorrow.
