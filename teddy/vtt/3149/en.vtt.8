00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:00.962
and going with something
that you already know is pretty good,

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:02.536
whether it's listening to music

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.194
or trying to decide
who you're going to spend time with.

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:07.712
It's also the problem
that technology companies face

00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:11.403

Over the last 60 years,

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:22.817
computer scientists have made
a lot of progress understanding

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.293
the explore/exploit trade-off,

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:26.715
and their results offer
some surprising insights.

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.889
When you're trying to decide
what restaurant to go to,

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:31.913
the first question you should ask yourself
