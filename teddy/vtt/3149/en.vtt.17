This idea of organizing things

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:36.681
so that the things you are most
likely to need are most accessible

00:08:36.705 --> 00:08:38.381
can also be applied in your office.

The Japanese economist Yukio Noguchi

00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:44.100
actually invented a filing system
that has exactly this property.

00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:46.770
He started with a cardboard box,

00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:49.734
and he put his documents into the box
from the left-hand side.

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:51.501
Each time he'd add a document,

00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:53.146
he'd move what was in there along

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.980
and he'd add that document
to the left-hand side of the box.

00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:58.671
And each time he accessed
a document, he'd take it out,

00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:01.303
consult it and put it back in
on the left-hand side.
