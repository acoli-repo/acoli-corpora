(Laughter)

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.792
He's exploiting the knowledge
that he's earned

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.583
through a lifetime's experience.

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:39.557
More generally,

00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.612
knowing about
the explore/exploit trade-off

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:45.303
can make it a little easier for you
to sort of relax and go easier on yourself

00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:47.137
when you're trying to make a decision.

00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:49.889
You don't have to go
to the best restaurant every night.

00:05:49.913 --> 00:05:52.892
Take a chance, try something new, explore.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.543
You might learn something.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:56.156
And the information that you gain

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.723
is going to be worth more
than one pretty good dinner.
