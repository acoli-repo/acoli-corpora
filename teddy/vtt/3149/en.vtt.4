the sorts of problems

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:01.952
that arise in adult life.

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:04.704

to break up with my girlfriend

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:08.078

(Laughter)

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:13.844

(Laughter)

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:28.974
(Applause)

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:32.459
