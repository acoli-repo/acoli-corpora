00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.371
and a slow memory system,
which is much larger.

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:04.239
In order for the computer to operate
as efficiently as possible,

00:07:04.263 --> 00:07:05.414
you want to make sure

00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:07.790
that the pieces of information
you want to access

00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:09.291
are in the fast memory system,

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.069
so that you can get to them quickly.

00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:13.154
Each time you access
a piece of information,

00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:14.703
it's loaded into the fast memory

00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:18.604
and the computer has to decide which item
it has to remove from that memory,

00:07:18.628 --> 00:07:20.369
because it has limited capacity.

00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:22.945
Over the years,

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:25.708
computer scientists have tried
a few different strategies

00:07:25.732 --> 00:07:28.024
for deciding what to remove
from the fast memory.

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:31.224
They've tried things like choosing
something at random
