00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.934
This was a groundbreaking moment
for Oregon students.

00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.434
Here's an example
of how this is playing out now.

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:07.268
Let's say a student
is having a really hard month.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:09.643
They're overwhelmed, overworked,

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:12.643
they're falling behind in school,
and they know they need help.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:16.143
Maybe they've never talked about
mental health with their parents before,

00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:19.579
but now they have a law on their side
to help initiate that conversation.

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:23.298
The parent still needs to be the one
to call the school and excuse the absence,

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:25.513
so it's not like
it's a free pass for the kids,

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:26.768
but most importantly,

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:29.934
now that school has that absence
recorded as a mental health day,

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.226
so they can keep track
