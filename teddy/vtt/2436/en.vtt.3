00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.976
in similar ways that we care
for our physical well-being.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.059
Our head and our body are connected
by much more than just our neck after all.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:38.351
Mental illness even manifests itself
in some physical ways,

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.934
such as nausea, headaches,
fatigue and shortness of breath.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.268
So since mental health affects all of us,

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:48.226
shouldn't we be coming up with solutions
that are accessible to all of us?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.059
That brings me to my second
part of my story.

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:52.393
When I was in high school

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.184
I had gotten pretty good
at managing my own mental health.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:56.518
I was a successful student,

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:59.667
and I was president of the Oregon
Association of Student Councils.
