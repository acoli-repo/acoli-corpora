00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.601
When I was a kid,

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.518
my mom and I made this deal.

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:11.643
I was allowed to take three
mental health rest days every semester

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.958
as long as I continued
to do well in school.

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:17.226
This was because I started
my mental health journey

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.476
when I was only six years old.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.393
I was always what my grade-school teachers
would call "a worrier,"

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.601
but later on we found out
that I have trauma-induced anxiety

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:27.917
and clinical depression.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.684
This made growing up pretty hard.
