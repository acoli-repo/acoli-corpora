00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:30.768
What could we do?

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.393
We approached this conversation
with an enormous amount of empathy

00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:35.684
and honesty,

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:37.601
and the results were astounding.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:38.893
What struck me the most

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.393
was that every single one
of my peers had a story

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.643
about a mental health
crisis in their school,

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.476
no matter if they were
from a tiny town in eastern Oregon

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.000
or the very heart of Portland.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.976
This was happening everywhere.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.309
We even did some research,

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:56.768
and we found out that suicide
is the second leading cause of death

00:02:56.792 --> 00:03:00.268
for youth ages 10 to 24 in Oregon.
