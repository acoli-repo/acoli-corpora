00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.434
Because oftentimes that day off

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:33.934
is the difference between
feeling a whole lot better

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.226
and a whole lot worse --

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.042
kind of like those days my mom
gave me when I was younger.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.601
So over the next few months,

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:45.018
we lobbied and researched
and campaigned for our bill,

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.292
and in June of 2019
it was finally signed into law.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:55.167
(Applause and cheers)

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.934
This was a groundbreaking moment
for Oregon students.
