I'd love to see a world
where each of us has a toolkit of skills

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.559
to help a friend, coworker, family member

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:07.184
or even stranger going through
a mental health crisis.

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:10.101
And these resources should be
especially available in schools

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.351
because that's where students
are struggling the most.

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:16.476
The other concept that I sincerely hope
you take with you today

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.309
is that it is always OK to not be OK,

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:21.643
and it is always OK to take a break.

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:23.351
It doesn't have to be a whole day;

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.059
sometimes that's not realistic.

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.458
But it can be a few moments here and there
to check in with yourself.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.708
Think of life like a race ...
