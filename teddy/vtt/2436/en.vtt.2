WEBVTT

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:01.583
is what kept me a happy,
healthy and successful student.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.976
Now I'm using those skills
that I learned as a kid

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.143
to help other students
with mental health challenges.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:12.309
I'm here today to offer you some insight
into the world of teenage mental health:

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.000
what's going on, how did we get here
and what can we do?

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.476
But first you need to understand

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.643
that while not everyone has
a diagnosed mental illness like I do,

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:23.143
absolutely everyone --

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:25.184
all of you have mental health.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:28.059
All of us have a brain
that needs to be cared for

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.976
in similar ways that we care
for our physical well-being.
