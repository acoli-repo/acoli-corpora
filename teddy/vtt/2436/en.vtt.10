but it could also literally save lives.

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:06.351
Now students from multiple other states
are also trying to pass these laws.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:09.601
I'm currently working with students
in both California and Colorado

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.893
to do the same,

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:12.976
because we believe
that students everywhere

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.559
deserve a chance to feel better.

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:17.643
Aside from all the practical
reasons and technicalities,

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:22.101
House Bill 2191 is really special
because of the core concept behind it:

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:26.018
that physical and mental health
are equal and should be treated as such.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:28.143
In fact, they're connected.

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:29.625
Take health care for example.
