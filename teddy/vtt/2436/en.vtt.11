00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.351
Think about CPR.

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.643
If you were put in a situation
where you had to administer CPR,

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:38.226
would you know at least
a little bit of what to do?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.893
Think to yourself --

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:44.268
most likely yes because CPR trainings
are offered in most schools, workplaces

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:45.601
and even online.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.851
We even have songs that go with it.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:50.226
But how about mental health care?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.601
I know I was trained in CPR
in my seventh-grade health class.

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:56.893
What if I was trained in seventh grade
how to manage my mental health

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:59.351
or how to respond
to a mental health crisis?

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.518
I'd love to see a world
where each of us has a toolkit of skills
