00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.708
Think of life like a race ...

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:33.684
like a long-distance race.

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:36.893
If you sprint in the very beginning
you're going to get burnt out.

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.268
You may even hurt yourself
from pushing too hard.

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.601
But if you pace yourself,

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:42.893
if you take it slow,
sometimes intentionally,

00:06:42.917 --> 00:06:44.601
and you push yourself other times,

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.250
you are sure to be way more successful.

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:49.309
So please,

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:50.643
look after each other,

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:52.663
look after the kids 
and teens in your life

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.768
especially the ones that look
like they have it all together.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:57.934
Mental health challenges
are not going away,

00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.226
but as a society,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.108
we can learn how to manage them
by looking after one another.
