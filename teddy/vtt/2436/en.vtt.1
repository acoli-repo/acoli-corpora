00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.684
This made growing up pretty hard.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:33.559
I was worried about a lot of things
that other kids weren't,

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.226
and school got really
overwhelming sometimes.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.101
This resulted in a lot of breakdowns,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.601
panic attacks --

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.268
sometimes I was super productive,

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:43.601
and other days
I couldn't get anything done.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.434
This was all happening during a time

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:47.559
when mental health
wasn't being talked about

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:48.851
as much as it is now,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.393
especially youth mental health.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.726
Some semesters I used
all of those rest days to the fullest.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.542
Others, I didn't need any at all.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:58.518
But the fact that they
were always an option

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:01.583
is what kept me a happy,
healthy and successful student.
