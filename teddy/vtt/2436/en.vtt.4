00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.934
But it was around this time
that I began to realize

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.684
mental health was much a bigger problem
than just for me personally.

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:09.851
Unfortunately, my hometown
was touched by multiple suicides

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:11.893
during my first year in high school.

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:15.143
I saw those tragedies
shake our entire community,

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.226
and as the president of a statewide group,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.059
I began hearing more and more stories

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:22.309
from students where this had
also happened in their town.

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.643
So in 2018 at our annual summer camp,

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.101
we held a forum with about
100 high school students

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.018
to discuss teenage mental health.

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:30.768
What could we do?
