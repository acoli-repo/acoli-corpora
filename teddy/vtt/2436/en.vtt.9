00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.226
so they can keep track

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.184
of just how many students
take how many mental health days.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.684
If a student takes too many,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:39.143
they'll be referred
to the school counselor for a check-in.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:42.309
This is important because we can
catch students who are struggling

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:43.643
before it's too late.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.726
One of the main things we heard
at that forum in 2018

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.309
is that oftentimes stepping forward
and getting help is the hardest step.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.684
We're hoping that this law
can help with that.

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:57.393
This not only will start teaching kids
young how to take care of themselves

00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.601
and practice self-care
and stress management,

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.792
but it could also literally save lives.
