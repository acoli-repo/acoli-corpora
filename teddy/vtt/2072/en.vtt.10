In 2008,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
was awarded for work done

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
on a molecule called green fluorescent protein

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of a jellyfish,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in terms of the impact that it has had

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
on cell biology and genetic engineering.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Another thing all these molecules are telling us

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in evolutionary history,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which is a clear indication
