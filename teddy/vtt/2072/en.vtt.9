one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the substrate, he called luciferin

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
after Lucifer the Lightbearer.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In fact, most of the people

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
studying bioluminescence today

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
have proved so incredibly valuable

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
for developing antibacterial agents,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
cancer fighting drugs,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
testing for the presence of life on Mars,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
detecting pollutants in our waters --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which is how we use it at ORCA.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
