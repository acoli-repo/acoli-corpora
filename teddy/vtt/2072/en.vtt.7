00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and do nearest neighbor distances.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to see a light show like this.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You can actually see it in surface waters.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And this isn't someplace exotic

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because the heads on ships --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --
