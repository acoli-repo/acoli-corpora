This is a Christmas tree of a fish;

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
everything on this fish lights up,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's not just that lure.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's got a built-in flashlight.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that it uses for a type of camouflage

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that obliterates its shadow,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it makes itself disappear.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's got light organs in the mouth,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
all used for different things --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
some of which we know about, some of which we don't.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,
