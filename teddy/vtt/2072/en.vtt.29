00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
by photographer Mark Richards,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
who happened to be there at the precise moment

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that we discovered that it all came together.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
That's me on the left,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And we were very, very happy.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So now we had a system

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that we could actually take to some place

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that might be patrolled by large predators.
