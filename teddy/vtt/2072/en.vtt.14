00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a blue luminescent lure on it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
This is another one of my favorite fish.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
on the end of a long fishing rod

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that it arches in front of the toothy jaw

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that gives the viperfish its name.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The teeth on this fish are so long

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it would actually impale its own brain.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So instead, it slides in grooves

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
on the outside of the head.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is a Christmas tree of a fish;
