00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
albeit a little fuzzy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that's just electronic noise

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
on these super intensified cameras.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You don't see luminescence until the submersible

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
begins to move forward through the water,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but as it does, animals bumping into the screen

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
are stimulated to bioluminesce.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, when I was first doing this,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
there were per cubic meter.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by the type of flashes they produced.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine
