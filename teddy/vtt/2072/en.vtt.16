some of which we know about, some of which we don't.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
my favorite topic with so many people.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I do wish, with their budget,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
who could have told them that those are the eyes

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in front of this living mousetrap

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of needle-sharp teeth

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
