In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
"People protect what they love,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that's the incredible number and variety

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of animals in it that make light.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Right after I completed my Ph.D.,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists
