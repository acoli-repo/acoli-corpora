00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that was using it for the first time

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as a tool for ocean exploration.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then my first open ocean dive

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
was in Santa Barbara Channel.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It was an evening dive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I went down to a depth of 880 feet

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and turned out the lights.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
this phenomenon of animals making light

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
called bioluminescence.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I was totally unprepared

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
for how much there was

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and how spectacular it was.
