00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And this one has a lure

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
was to attract different types of prey,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but then stomach content analyses on these fish

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
have revealed that

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
they all eat pretty much the same thing.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is how the male recognizes the female

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in the anglerfish world,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
because many of these males

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
are what are known as dwarf males.
