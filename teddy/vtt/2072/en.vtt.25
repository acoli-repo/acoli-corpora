00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
because of the way we explore the ocean.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is we go out and drag nets behind ships.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I defy you to name any other branch of science

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The other primary way is we go down

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
When I'm sitting in a submersible though,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, I've wanted for a long time
