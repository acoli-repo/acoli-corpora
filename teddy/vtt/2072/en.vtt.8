00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are flushed with unfiltered seawater

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, if you stagger into the head late at night

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and you're so toilet-hugging sick

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that you forget to turn on the light,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
you may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, how does a living creature make light?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, that was the question that 19th century

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
French physiologist Raphael Dubois,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
asked about this bioluminescent clam.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the substrate, he called luciferin
