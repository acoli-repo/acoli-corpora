00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, I've wanted for a long time

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
to figure out a different way to explore.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And scientists have done this on land for years;

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
we just use a color that the animals can't see

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then a camera that can see that color.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You can't use infrared in the sea.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
because it gets absorbed so quickly.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Made an intensified camera,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Thing is, in science,
