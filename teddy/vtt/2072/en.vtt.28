so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
get the electronic jellyfish working.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the word Ziploc is still visible.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But there came a moment when it all came together,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and everything worked.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
by photographer Mark Richards,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
who happened to be there at the precise moment
