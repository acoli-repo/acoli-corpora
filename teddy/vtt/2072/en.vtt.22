00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is not just the amount of light,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
For this fish, it's actually whole cells

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
with nuclei and membranes.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and we have no idea why it does it --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Now, another form of defense

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
is something called a burglar alarm --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the honking horn and flashing lights

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the police that will come and take the burglar away --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
its only hope for escape may be
