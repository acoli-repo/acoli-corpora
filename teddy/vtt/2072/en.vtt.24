00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
all I did was touch it once per second

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This is an unbelievable light show.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's this pinwheel of light,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And I thought, "You know,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that might actually make a pretty good lure."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Because one of the things that's frustrated me

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
as a deep-sea explorer

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
because of the way we explore the ocean.
