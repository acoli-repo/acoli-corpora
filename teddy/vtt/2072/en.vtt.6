00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by the type of flashes they produced.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
at 740 feet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Like those big explosions, sparks,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
are from a little comb jelly,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and jellyfish.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
There was another one of those comb jellies.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to develop automatic recognition systems

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that can identify these animals

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,
