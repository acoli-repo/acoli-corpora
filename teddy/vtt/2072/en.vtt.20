00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This shrimp is actually

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
spewing light out of its mouth

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
like a fire breathing dragon

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in order to blind or distract this viperfish

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There's jellyfish, there's squid,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
there's a whole lot of different crustaceans,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
there's even fish that can do this.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because it actually has a tube on its shoulder

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that can squirt out light.
