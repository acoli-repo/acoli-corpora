Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it's these guys; it's fireflies.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
some insects, earthworms, fungi --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but in general, on land, it's really rare.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In the ocean, it's the rule

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
rather than the exception.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If I go out in the open ocean environment,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
virtually anywhere in the world,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
most of the animals --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the animals that I bring up in that net --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
make light.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.
