00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, most animals make blue light,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and most animals can only see blue light,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
but this fish is a really fascinating exception

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because it has two red light organs.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And I have no idea why there's two,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and that's something I want to solve some day --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but not only can it see blue light,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but it can see red light.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to be able to sneak up on animals

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that are blind to red light

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and be able to see them without being seen.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's also got a little chin barbel here

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a blue luminescent lure on it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
