00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
its only hope for escape may be

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that will attack their attacker,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
thereby affording them a chance for escape.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This jellyfish, for example, has

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
a spectacular bioluminescent display.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is us chasing it in the submersible.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
bring it into the lab on the ship.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And then to generate the display you're about to see,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
all I did was touch it once per second

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick
