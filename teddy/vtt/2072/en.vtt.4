00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
make light.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now I want to share with you a little video

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that I shot from a submersible.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I first developed this technique working from a little

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
single-person submersible called Deep Rover

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which you see here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
there's a a three-foot diameter hoop

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
with a screen stretched across it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
albeit a little fuzzy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
