00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and how spectacular it was.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that were longer than this room,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
pumping out so much light

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that I could read the dials and gauges

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
inside the suit without a flashlight;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and puffs and billows

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of what looked like luminous blue smoke;

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and explosions of sparks

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that would swirl up out of the thrusters --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but these were icy, blue embers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was breathtaking.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,
