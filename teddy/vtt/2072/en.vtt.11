00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in evolutionary history,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which is a clear indication

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of how spectacularly important

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
this trait is for survival.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, what is it about bioluminescence

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that's so important to so many animals?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
by staying in the darkness,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
light can still be very useful

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and that's find food,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
attract a mate and avoid being eaten.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So, for example, this fish

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
has a built-in headlight behind its eye

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that it can use for finding food
