And I want to argue that more
than a hundred years later,

00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:04.946
that two-ness has made us
strong and resilient,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.209
and I would say for brown people, women --

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:12.277
all of us who have had to navigate
the world through the eyes of others --

00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.200
we should now share that strength
to the rest of those

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:18.731
who have had the privilege to be singular.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.120
I'd like to share with you a project,

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:24.570
because I do think this two-ness
can find itself in the world around us.

00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:28.106
And it's beginning to happen where
we're beginning to share these stories.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.611
