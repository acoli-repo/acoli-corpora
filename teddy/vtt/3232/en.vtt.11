00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.204
it's a strange thing.

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:32.453

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:33.778
It's a strange thing,

00:05:33.802 --> 00:05:37.274

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:54.514
we forget.

00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:59.022
The next example? Empathy.

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:03.000
And I've heard that a couple of times
in this conference,
