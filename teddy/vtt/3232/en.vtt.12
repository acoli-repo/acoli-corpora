00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:03.000
And I've heard that a couple of times
in this conference,

00:06:03.024 --> 00:06:04.688
this notion of caring.

00:06:05.546 --> 00:06:09.086
Twenty-five years ago,
when I was a young pup,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.712
very optimistic,

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:14.162
we wanted to design a park
in downtown Oakland, California

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:15.652
for the homeless people.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.962
And we said, homeless people
can be in the same space

00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:20.743
as people who wear suits.

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:23.466
And everyone was like,
"That's never going to work.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.545
People are not going to eat lunch
with the homeless people."

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:28.636
We built the park.

00:06:29.584 --> 00:06:31.960
It cost 1.1 million dollars.
