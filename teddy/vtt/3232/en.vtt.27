00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:31.161
And you'll be forced to come to terms
with that memory of place,

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.062
that memory of that crossing,

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:37.069
that at times seems very lucid and clear,

00:13:37.093 --> 00:13:42.048
but at other times, forces us
again to reconcile the scale.

00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:47.514
And hopefully, as people move
through this landscape every day,

00:13:47.538 --> 00:13:50.085
unreconciled, they'll remember,

00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:51.861
and hopefully when we remember,

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:53.854
e pluribus unum.

00:13:53.878 --> 00:13:55.164
Thank you.

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:59.134
