00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.925
where things have happened,

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.978
can actually force us to look
at one another in a different way.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:10.134
And lastly: this is not just
an American motto anymore.

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:12.464
I think e pluribus unum is global.

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:14.385
We're in this thing together.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.532
First, great things happen
when we exist in each other's world --

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:21.908
like today, right?

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:25.862
The world of community gardens --

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.258
most of you have probably
seen a community garden.

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:30.853
They're all about subsistence
and food. Right?
