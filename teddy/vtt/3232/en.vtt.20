00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.995
And lastly, I want to share with you
a project that we're currently working on,

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.877
and I think it will force us all
to remember in a really different way.

00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:10.811
There are lots of things
in the landscape around us,

00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:14.131
and most of the time we don't know
what's below the ground.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:16.975
Here in Charleston, South Carolina,

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:18.292
a verdant piece of grass.

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.994
Most people just pass by it daily.

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:22.434
But underneath it,

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:26.931
it's where they discovered
Gadsden’s Wharf.

00:10:27.773 --> 00:10:32.033
We think more than 40 percent
of the African diaspora landed here.
