00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.197
And so they called me,

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.831
and I designed one in Jamaica, Queens.

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:07.168
And on the way to designing this garden,

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:09.931
I went to the New York
Restoration Project Office,

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:13.314
and I noticed a familiar name
on the door downstairs.

00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:15.107
I go upstairs, and I said,

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.383
"Do you guys know who is downstairs?"

00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:19.081
And they said, "Gunit."

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:21.229

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:23.326
You mean G-Unit?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.462
Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson?"

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:26.666
(Laughter)

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.376
And they said, "Yeah?"

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.634
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:32.480
And so we went downstairs,
and before you knew it,
