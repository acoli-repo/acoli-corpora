00:11:29.843 --> 00:11:33.246
you are forced to walk through
the remains of the warehouse,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.002
where slaves were stored

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:37.882
on hot, sultry days, for days,

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.148
and perished.

00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:41.674
And you'll have to come face-to-face

00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:43.588
with the Negro,

00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:46.983
who worked in the marshes,

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:51.059
who was able to,
with the sickle-cell trait,

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.761
able to stand in high waters
for long, long days.

00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:57.555
And at night, it'll be open 24/7,

00:11:57.579 --> 00:11:59.337
for everybody to experience.

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:03.343
But we'll also talk about
those other beautiful things
