00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.451
it's not as simple as I thought
it would be to explain,

00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:34.244
but as I left to go to college,
my father looked at me,

00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:37.596

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.717
and this two-ness,
this double consciousness.

00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.951
