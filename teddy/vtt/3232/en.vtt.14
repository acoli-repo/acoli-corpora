00:06:57.828 --> 00:07:01.465
The National Park Service
built the bathroom.

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:03.558
So we were able to go ahead

00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:05.528
because we had empathy.

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:08.239
Now, 25 years later,

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:12.847
we have an even larger
homeless problem in the Bay Area.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:15.864
But the park is still there,

00:07:15.888 --> 00:07:17.831
and the people are still there.

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:19.698
So for me, that's a success.

00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:21.572
And when people see that,

00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:25.801
hopefully, they'll have empathy
for the people under freeways and tents,

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:28.332
and why can't our public spaces

00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:32.214
house them and force us to be empathetic?
