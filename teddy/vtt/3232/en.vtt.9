00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:32.093
the academical village
by Thomas Jefferson,

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:37.258
it's a place that we're beginning
to notice now was built by African hands.

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:38.942
So we have to begin to say,

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:41.133
"OK, how do we talk about that?"

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:44.115
As the University
was expanding to the south,

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.567
they found a site
that was the house of Kitty Foster,

00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.847
free African American woman.

00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.052
And she was there,

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:55.302
and her descendants,

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.867
they all lived there,

00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.676
and she cleaned for the boys of UVA.
