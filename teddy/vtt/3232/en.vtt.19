00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:33.232
Over the years, people had started
putting in chicken coops, hay bales,

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:35.260
community gardens and all of these things,

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:38.071
and they could not see
that traditional thing behind them.

00:09:38.095 --> 00:09:40.451
But we said, we're bringing
the community back.

00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:44.876
American Disability Act -- we were able
to get five million dollars.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.427
And now, the tradition belongs
to these brown and black people,

00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:50.619
and they use it.

00:09:50.643 --> 00:09:52.083
And they learn theater,

00:09:52.107 --> 00:09:53.527
after-school programs.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.578
There's no more chickens.

00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:56.992
But there is art.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.995
And lastly, I want to share with you
a project that we're currently working on,
