00:12:56.196 --> 00:13:01.073
So we decided to bring the water
up on top of the surface,

00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:03.189
seven feet above tide,

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:08.722
and then cast the figures
full length, six feet,

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:11.154
multiply them across the surface,

00:13:11.178 --> 00:13:12.543
in tabby,

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:16.311
and then allow people
to walk across that divide.

00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:19.047
And hopefully, as people come,

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:20.633
the water will drain out,

00:13:21.304 --> 00:13:22.519
fill up,

00:13:22.543 --> 00:13:24.473
drain out and fill up.

00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:31.161
And you'll be forced to come to terms
with that memory of place,
