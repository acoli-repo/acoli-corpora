00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.669
but if people look a different way,

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:31.977
it's not traditional.

00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:36.073
It's not until they leave
and then new people come in

00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:38.341
where the traditional gets valued.

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:39.808
A little quick story here:

00:08:40.572 --> 00:08:42.562
1888 opera house,

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.529
the oldest in San Francisco,

00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:46.870
sits in Bayview–Hunters Point.

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:48.869
Over its history,

00:08:48.893 --> 00:08:50.833
it's provided theater,

00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:54.778
places for businesses,
places for community gatherings, etc.

00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:59.399
It's also a place where Ruth Williams
taught many black actors.

00:08:59.423 --> 00:09:00.998
Think: Danny Glover --
