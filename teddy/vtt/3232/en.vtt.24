But we'll also talk about
those other beautiful things

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:05.753
that my African ancestors
brought with them:

00:12:05.777 --> 00:12:07.080
a love of landscape,

00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:11.698
a respect for the spirits
that live in trees and rocks and water,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.041
the ethnobotanical aspects,

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:18.522
the plants that we use
for medicinal purposes.

00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:20.934

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.983
we want to remind people
in Charleston, South Carolina,

00:12:25.007 --> 00:12:27.038
of the black bodies,

00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:29.307
because when you go to Charleston today,

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.922
the Confederacy is celebrated,
