We think more than 40 percent
of the African diaspora landed here.

00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:34.789
How could you forget that?

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.476
How could you forget?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.016
So we dug, dug, and we found the wharf.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.083
And so in 2020,

00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:45.653
Harry Cobb and myself and others

00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:48.812
are building the International
African American Museum.

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.716
And it will celebrate --

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.053
(Applause)

00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:59.048
this place where we know,
beneath the ground,

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:01.345
thousands died, perished,
