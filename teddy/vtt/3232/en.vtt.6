It's for young and old,

00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:05.760
but more importantly, it's a place --

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.198
there was a story in the Times
about six months ago

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:12.545
where this young woman
found solace in going to the garden.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.161
It had nothing to do with me.
It had more to do with 50, I'm sure,

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:20.244
but it has inspired people
to think about gardens

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:22.849
and sharing each other's worlds
in a different way.

00:03:24.242 --> 00:03:26.719
This next concept, "two-ness" --

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.451
it's not as simple as I thought
it would be to explain,
