How can landscapes imbue memory?

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.226
When we think about
this notion "e pluribus unum" --

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.801
"out of many, one,"

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.987
it's a pretty strange concept, right?

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.695
I mean, with all different races
and cultures of people,

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.830
how do you boil it down to one thing?

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.768
I want to share with you today
this idea of "e pluribus unum"

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:32.448
and how our landscape might imbue
those memories of diverse perspectives,
