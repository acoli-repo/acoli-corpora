00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:00.429
in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.”

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.278
Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction

00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:07.367
that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.986
or as he called it, “the end of history,”

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.165
their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:16.314
at any given moment.

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:21.966
The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:26.123
They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits,

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:27.054
values,

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.590
and preferences,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.347
along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before.
