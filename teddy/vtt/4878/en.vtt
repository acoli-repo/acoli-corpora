Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars,

00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:20.101
telephones,

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:20.912
radio,

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:21.721
television,

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.672
and computers.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.269

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.131

insisted they wouldn’t catch on.

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.688
Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like
