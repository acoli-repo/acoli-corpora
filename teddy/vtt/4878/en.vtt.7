00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:30.593
Without the end of history Illusion,

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.615
it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:38.106
So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives,

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:40.109
but what about the wider world?

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.146
Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be?

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:47.759
If so, fortunately,
there are countless records

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.293
to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better.

00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.176
Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history,

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:59.485
and that can be just as much a source
of comfort as a cause for concern.
