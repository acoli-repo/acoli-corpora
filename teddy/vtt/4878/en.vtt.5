00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:32.357
And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:35.492
that 50-year-olds had reconsidered.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:39.254
While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole,

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:43.655
they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much.

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:47.649
Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists:

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:52.923
we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.687
One consequence of this thinking

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:58.294
is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices

00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.800
based on present preferences.
