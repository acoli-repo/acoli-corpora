00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.688
Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.122
or what new inventions will populate it.

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.679
But time and time again,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.243
we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:42.019
will change the future.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.069
And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives:

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.619
we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.691
Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change

00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:00.429
in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.”
