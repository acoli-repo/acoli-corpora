00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.347
along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before.

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.949
The other half described those features 
in their present selves,

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:40.712
and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future.

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:42.064
Based on these answers,

00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:44.911
the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.502
each participant reported or predicted.

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.038
For every age group in the sample,

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.495
they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes.

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:58.648
So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:03.059
to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed.
