00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.800
based on present preferences.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.267
On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.934

than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago.

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.676

we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.191

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.304
partners,

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:28.772
what our preferences 
will be in the future.

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:30.593
