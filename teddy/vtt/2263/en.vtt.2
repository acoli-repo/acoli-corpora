Article 6, the right to be recognized
as a person before the law.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.202
Or, a legal identity.

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:07.386
For children, this is a birth certificate.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.235
And despite this being
a universal human right,

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.732
one billion people today
have no record they exist,

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:18.496
making it one of the greatest
human rights violations of our time,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.959
yet nobody seems to know about it.

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.872
In the face of world poverty and hunger,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.436
making sure everyone in the world
has a legal identity

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.926
doesn't really seem important,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.608
but in reality it is.
