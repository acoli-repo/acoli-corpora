So, when I was 14,

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:07.640
my family was in the process of adopting
my little brothers from Ethiopia.

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:09.956
And one day my mom asked,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.483
"What day should we put
for their birthday?"

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:16.152
"Uh, the day they were born, obviously?"

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:17.891
Ridiculous question.

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:19.553
And then my mom said,

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:20.825
"Well, Kristen,

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.573
neither of your little brothers
have a birth certificate,

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:26.027
so how do you suggest
we find out when that was?"

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.093
Mind blown.

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:31.282
Now, 20 years later,
I'm still working on it,
