00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:34.775
that improved birth registration
coverage goes hand in hand

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:36.521
with improved development outcomes,

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:37.951

00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:40.947
to better health, nutrition, education,

00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:42.483
economic improvement

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:44.777
and safe and orderly migration.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.723
in efforts to end poverty,

00:04:58.747 --> 00:04:59.913
hunger

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:01.389
and reduce inequalities.
