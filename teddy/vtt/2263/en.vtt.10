00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:01.389
and reduce inequalities.

00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:03.554
But how are they going
to uphold human rights

00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:06.027
and how do they know
if anyone is being left behind

00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.331
if they do not know who they are
or where they are

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:10.726
in the first place?

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.102
So what can countries do about this?

00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:18.040
Now, there's no one-size-fits-all model,

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:20.307
because every country context is unique.

00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:24.391
There are five proven interventions
that can be applied to any system.

00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:26.776
Number one, reduce the distance.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.665
Two, remove the cost.

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.561
Three, simplify the process.
