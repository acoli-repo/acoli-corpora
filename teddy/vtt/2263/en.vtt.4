When we left, I asked the social worker
what the case plan was,

00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:07.983
and she said, "Well first, we have
to get her a birth certificate."

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:09.374
I was a little taken aback.

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:12.834
I said, "Well, don't you think we need
to get her some social assistance

00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:14.922
and a safe place to live
and into a school?"

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:18.570
She goes, "Exactly, which is why
we need to get her a birth certificate."

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.721
See, without a legal identity,

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.278
you are not recognized
as a person by the government.

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:27.936
And a person who doesn't officially exist
can't access government services,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.255
and the government
can only provide services
