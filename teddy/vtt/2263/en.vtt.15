00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:33.097
And when the cost of inaction is
innocent children are left unprotected,

00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:35.803
unvaccinated, unable to go to school,

00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:39.672
growing up to be adults who are unable
to find decent work or vote,

00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:44.567
trapped in a cycle of poverty,
exclusion and invisibility,

00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.313
it comes down to us

00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:48.766
to take this issue out of the darkness

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.942
and into the light.

00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:54.359
Because it's not every day you get
the opportunity to change the world,

00:07:54.383 --> 00:07:55.713
but today,

00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:56.888
you do.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.104
Thanks.

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:01.105
(Applause)
