00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.608
but in reality it is.

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.775
See, early in my career,

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.787
I was working with a social worker
in a slum community in Mumbai,

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.485
and we were following up
on a case with this little girl

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
who had contracted polio as a baby
and was paralyzed from the waist down.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:46.447
When we arrived at the home,

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.248
we found her on the floor.

00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:51.265
Her legs were badly scarred and infected,

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.878
she was malnourished,

00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:55.278
she had never gone to school

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:59.569
and she had spent most of her life
confined to this small, dark room.
