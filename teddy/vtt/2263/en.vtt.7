00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.562
A study across 17 countries
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:35.115
found that 80 percent of children
did not have a birth certificate.

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.321
Out of the countries
that have not yet achieved

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:41.120
universal birth registration coverage,

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:45.251
in 26 countries, a birth certificate
is required to access health care,

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:46.654
including vaccines.

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.951
In 37 countries, it's required
to access social assistance

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:53.298
intended to bring people out of poverty.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:59.135
And in 59 countries,
a birth certificate is required

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.951
for a child to be enrolled
or complete school.
