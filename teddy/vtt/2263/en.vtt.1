00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:31.282
Now, 20 years later,
I'm still working on it,

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.409
except instead of trying
to solve the mystery

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.449
of my brothers' missing
birth certificates,

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:37.284
I try to solve this problem globally.

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:41.099
So what do birth certificates have to do
with international development?

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:44.733
To answer that, we have to look back
at the original development agenda,

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:46.447
the human rights agenda.

00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.306
So in 1948, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.783
for the first time,

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:55.528
set a shared vision of basic
human rights and dignities

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:58.633
that apply to all people in all nations:

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:03.372
Article 6, the right to be recognized
as a person before the law.
