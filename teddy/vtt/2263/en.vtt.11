00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.561
Three, simplify the process.

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:32.699
Four, remove discrimination.

00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:34.749
Five, increase demand.

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:38.010
Gender discrimination
remains a hidden problem,

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:41.162
because statistically,
there's no difference

00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:43.326

of boys and girls.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.681
But the discrimination

or to be present in order
for the child's birth to be registered.

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:58.076
So in situations where the father
is unknown, unwilling

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.995
or unable to claim paternity,
