00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.276
the mothers are legally prevented
from registering the births

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.506
of their own children.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:07.869
So to address this,
Angola put a policy in place

00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:10.988
allowing mothers to register
their children as a single parent.

00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:14.379
In Tanzania, in 2012,

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.189
only 13 percent of children
had a birth certificate.

00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:20.006
So the government
came up with a new system.

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:26.109
They put registration centers
in existing infrastructure,

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:28.019
such as community wards

00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:29.945
and in health facilities.

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.138
So they brought the services closer
to the people who needed them.
