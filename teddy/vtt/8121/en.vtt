00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:13.384
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:19.640
the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth,

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.020
more than double what the bottom 90% owns.

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:26.522
Income and wealth inequality are not new.

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:29.984
In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:33.571
throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it.
