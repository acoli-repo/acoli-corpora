00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'd like to start off with is an observation,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which is that if I've learned anything over the last year,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
it's that the supreme irony

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of publishing a book about slowness

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I seem to spend most of my time these days

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
zipping from city to city, studio to studio,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
interview to interview,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Because everyone these days

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
wants to know how to slow down,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so I did a spot on CNN the other day

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
