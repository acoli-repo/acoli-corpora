00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.613
which interprets the impulses

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:34.738

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.905
Eyeglasses help you see.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.863
The earliest forms of eye gear

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:41.738
can be traced back 4,000 years.

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:45.571
Cultures that needed to adapt
to climates that were snowy

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:46.988
created eye shields,

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.405
and they were made of
bone and animal hides.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.446
They had small slits
for people to see through,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.071
but no lenses.

was called a reading stone

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.655
and was invented over 1,000 years ago.
