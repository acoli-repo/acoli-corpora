00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:02.512
I think that at the time,

00:00:02.554 --> 00:00:05.863
Catwoman had a really
cool pair of glasses

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:08.905
in the Batman series
that was on television.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.988
And I wanted to be cool like her.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.280
It didn't occur to me

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.821
that glasses were really a medical device.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:16.505
(Small Thing.)

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:18.025
(Big Idea.)

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:22.696
When light rays reflect off an object

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.530
and enter the eye through the cornea,

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:28.155
your retina converts this
light into electrical impulses

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.821
that are sent to the brain,

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.613
which interprets the impulses
