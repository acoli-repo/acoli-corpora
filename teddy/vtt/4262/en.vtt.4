00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:02.113
Sometimes a pair of glasses
became popularized

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:05.321
by the actual person
that was wearing them,

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:07.155
and then that personality trait

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.238
was projected into the actual device.

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:11.863
You had the aviator glasses,

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:13.905
which showed a forward-thinking,

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.946
adventurous type of person.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.280
Glasses with heavy frames
signified intelligence

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.863
or nerdiness.

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:25.071
Wayfarers signified
this kind of nerdy punk,

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:26.571
the outlaw, the misfit.

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:30.655
Glasses have become
so popular as a fashion device
