00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The exhibition will talk about the work

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of both designers and scientists,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm showing to you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
different sections of the show right now,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just to give you a taste of it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
have really opened the designer's mind.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is the work of some scientists from UCLA.
