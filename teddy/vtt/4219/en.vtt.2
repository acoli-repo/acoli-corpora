00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And this is what this exhibition looks at.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you think about your life today,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you go every day through many different scales,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
many different changes of rhythm and pace.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
others are a little slower,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Other people are not as elastic.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.
