and there's a gigantic history behind it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But according to a really great science historian you might know,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
have brought to designers is this renewed interest,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,
