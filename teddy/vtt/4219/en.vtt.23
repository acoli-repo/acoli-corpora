00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
made by rapid manufacturing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000

and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
not only regarding the participation of the final buyer

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
in the design process, but also no tracking,
