You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And so, the assignment to the students was,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
how should the steak of tomorrow be?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
what should it be like?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So this particular student, James King,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
went around the beautiful English countryside,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
picked the best, best cow that he could see,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and then put her in the MRI machine.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,
