00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you know, scientists would tell designers,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
they really started talking each others' language,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in London at the Serpentine.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And it's really interesting to see how this happens.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The exhibition will talk about the work

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of both designers and scientists,
