00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
just like designers are seeking scientists.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that's now a multimedia company, you might know it --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we founded about a year ago a monthly salon

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you know, scientists would tell designers,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.
