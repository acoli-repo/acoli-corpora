00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to be wearing everything leather in the future.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
as anything in our life today,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and at different levels.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
One of the most interesting and most important concepts

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is the idea of scale. We change scale very often:

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we change resolution of screens, and

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.
