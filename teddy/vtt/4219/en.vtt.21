And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
so if you're too shy to be really at the date,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you can stay at a distance with your flowers

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and somebody else reenacts the date for you.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Rapid manufacturing is another big area

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
in which technology and design are, I think,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Rapid manufacturing is a computer file

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning
