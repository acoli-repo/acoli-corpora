00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And this exhibition is about the work of designers

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that help us be more elastic,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and also of designers that really work on this elasticity

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
as an opportunity. And one last thing is that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and into the preview, I would like to point out

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
this beautiful detail about scientists and design.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You can say that the relationship between science and design

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
goes back centuries. You can of course talk about

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --
