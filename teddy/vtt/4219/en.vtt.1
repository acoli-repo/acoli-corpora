WEBVTT

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because it seems like every time I change jobs.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Design and the Elastic Mind."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The world that I decided to focus on this particular time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is the world of science and the world of technology.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Technology always comes into play when design is involved,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but science does a little less.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and transforming them so that we can use them.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And this is what this exhibition looks at.
