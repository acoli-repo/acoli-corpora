00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But what we're going to talk about today

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is really design. Really good designers are like sponges:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they really are curious

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and absorb every kind of information that comes their way,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so that gives me an opportunity,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because every design show that I curate

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
kind of looks at a different world. And it's great,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because it seems like every time I change jobs.
