00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
with all the go-to, go-back-to,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
also made into a beautiful choreography.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And then also graphs by scientists,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the fact that many scientists

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So they pick the worst background

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.
