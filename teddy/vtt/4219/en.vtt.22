It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it was machines carving out of a foam block

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
a model that was very, very fragile,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and could not have any real use.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Techniques became better -- not only carving

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to the point that now we can have actual chairs

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
made by rapid manufacturing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,
