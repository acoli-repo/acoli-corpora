WEBVTT

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we change resolution of screens, and

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So you go, even in the exhibition,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to the manipulation of really great amounts of data --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
In this particular case a section will be devoted

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to information design.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized
