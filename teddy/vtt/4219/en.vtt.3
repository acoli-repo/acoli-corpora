Other people are not as elastic.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And that's because there's some little bit of fear,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
these kinds of discomforts that we have,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and try to make life easier for us.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And this exhibition is about the work of designers
