00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is the work of some scientists from UCLA.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
from the Royal College of Arts in London

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
New sensing elements on the body --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you can grow hairs on your nails,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.
