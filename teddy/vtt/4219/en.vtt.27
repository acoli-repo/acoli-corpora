00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And so this student at the RCA

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
designed this beautiful blown-glass object

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
where the bees move from one chamber to the other

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
if they detect that particular smell

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Another shape is made for cancer.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that designers have really shaped for themselves.
