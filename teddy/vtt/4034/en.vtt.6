00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.648
And in fact, in our system, I think
it's better to be an affluent person

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:03.960
suspected of trying
to blow up a police station

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.651
than it is to be a poor person

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.332
who's suspected of much,
much less than this.

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.931
I want to give you an example
from my current work.

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.559
Right now, I'm working
at a civil rights organization in DC,

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.915
called Equal Justice Under Law.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.848
Let me start by asking you all a question.

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:22.859
How many of you have ever gotten
a parking ticket in your life?

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:24.047
Raise your hand.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.017
Yeah. So have I.

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:27.374
And when I had to pay it,

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:29.429
it felt annoying and it felt bad,

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.369
but I paid it and I moved on.
