00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:32.592
So they called the paramedics
and the paramedics went to the cell.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:33.948
They said, "He'll be OK,"

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:36.176
so they just left him there on the floor.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.494
I heard many stories like this
and they shouldn't have surprised me,

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:43.070
because suicide is the single leading
cause of death in our local jails.

00:07:43.852 --> 00:07:46.839
This is related to the lack
of mental health care in our jails.

00:07:46.863 --> 00:07:50.783
I met a woman, single mother of three,
making seven dollars an hour.

00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:53.599
She relies on food stamps
to feed herself and her children.

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:55.652
About a decade ago,

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:59.441
she got a couple of traffic tickets
and a minor theft charge,

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.233
and she can't afford her fines
and fees on those cases.
