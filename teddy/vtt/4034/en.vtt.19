00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:31.142
It's a matter of whether you can afford
to post your bail amount.

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:33.878
So Bill Cosby, whose bail
was set at a million dollars,

00:09:33.902 --> 00:09:37.362
immediately writes the check,
and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:39.118
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,

00:09:39.142 --> 00:09:43.140
was only there because her family
was unable to come up with 500 dollars.

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:46.551
In fact, there are half a million
Sandra Blands across the country --

00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:48.841
500,000 people who are in jail right now,

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.526
only because they can't afford
their bail amount.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.607
We're told that our jails
are places for criminals,

00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.644
but statistically that's not the case:

00:09:56.668 --> 00:10:00.969
three out of every five people
in jail right now are there pretrial.
