At one point, the officer
who patted me down

00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:05.064
scanned the side of the police station
to see where the security camera was

00:02:05.088 --> 00:02:07.960
to see how much of this
was being recorded.

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.152
And when he did that,

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:12.646
it really sank in how completely
I was at their mercy.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.093
I think we're all normalized
from a young age

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:18.870
to the idea of police officers
and arrests and handcuffs,

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:22.836
so it's easy to forget how demeaning
and coercive a thing it is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.765
to seize control over
another person's body.

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.834
I know it sounds like
the point of my story

00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:30.300
is how badly treated I was
because of my race --
