00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.085
"OK, it's unlikely this person
can come up with the money,

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:02.969
it's more likely this new person will."

00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:05.971
You're out, they're in,
and the machine kept moving like that.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:08.021
I met a man who,

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:12.312
nine years ago, was arrested
for panhandling in a Walgreens.

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:16.392
He couldn't afford his fines
and his court fees from that case.

00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:19.412
When he was young
he survived a house fire,

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:22.409
only because he jumped out
of the third-story window to escape.

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.634
But that fall left him
with damage to his brain

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:27.093
and several parts of this body,
including his leg.

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:28.276
So he can't work,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.802
and he relies on social security
payments to survive.
