00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.290
and before I could make it to my car,

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.615
two police cars pulled up
to block my exit,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.970
and an officer approached me from behind.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.266
He told me to stop, take my backpack off

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.366
and put my hands on the police car

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:53.182
and they laughed.

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.746
And as all this was happening --

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.020
