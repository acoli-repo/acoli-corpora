00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:30.300
is how badly treated I was
because of my race --

00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:33.444
and yes, I don't think I would've been
detained if I were white.

00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:36.207
But actually, what I have in mind
today is something else.

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:38.949
What I have in mind is how
much worse things might've been

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.137
if I weren't affluent.

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.079
I mean, they thought I might be trying
to plant an explosive,

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.272
and they investigated that possibility
for an hour and a half,

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.008
but I was never put in handcuffs,

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.044
I was never taken to a jail cell.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.128
I think if I were from one of Washington
DC's poor communities of color,

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:56.575
and they thought I was
endangering officers' lives,

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.220
things might've ended differently.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.648
And in fact, in our system, I think
it's better to be an affluent person
