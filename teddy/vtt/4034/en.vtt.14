Just imagine spending from right now
until sometime in June

00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.957
in the place that I described to you
a few moments ago.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.697
He told me about all the suicide attempts
he's seen in Ferguson's jail;

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:14.994
about the time a man found
a way to hang himself

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.678
out of reach of the other inmates,

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.864
so all they could do
was yell and yell and yell,

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:21.628
trying to get the guards' attention

00:07:21.652 --> 00:07:23.645
so they could come down and cut him down.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.105
And he told me that it took the guards
over five minutes to respond,

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:29.397
and when they came,
the man was unconscious.

00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:32.592
So they called the paramedics
and the paramedics went to the cell.
