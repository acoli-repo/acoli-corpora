00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.443
we can commit to thinking about
jailing in this different light,

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:05.947
then we can undo that normalization
I was referring to earlier.

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:09.009
If I leave you with anything today,
I hope it's with the thought

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:11.465
that if we want anything
to fundamentally change --

00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:14.769
not just to reform our policies
on bail and fines and fees --

00:12:14.793 --> 00:12:17.846
but also to make sure that whatever
new policies replace those

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.921
don't punish the poor and the marginalized
in their own new way.

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:22.577
If we want that kind of change,

00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:25.126
then this shift in thinking
is required of each of us.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.334
Thank you.

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:30.028
