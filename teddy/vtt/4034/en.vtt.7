00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.369
but I paid it and I moved on.

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:34.084
I'm guessing most of you
have paid your tickets as well.

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:38.903
But what would happen if you
couldn't afford the amount on the ticket

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.097
and your family doesn't have
the money either, what happens then?

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.112
Well, one thing that's not supposed
to happen under the law is,

00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:47.240
you're not supposed to be
arrested and jailed

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.360
simply because you can't afford to pay.

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.188
That's illegal under federal law.

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:54.140
But that's what local governments
across the country are doing

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.321
to people who are poor.

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:58.265
And so many of our lawsuits
at Equal Justice Under Law

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.742
target these modern-day debtors' prisons.
