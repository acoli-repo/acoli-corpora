00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:31.123
we'll still have jails full of poor people
who don't belong there.

00:11:31.147 --> 00:11:32.701
That really is depressing to me.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.149
But what's exciting to me is the thought
that these stories can move us

00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:38.216
to think about jailing in different terms.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.611
Not in sterile policy terms
like "mass incarceration,"

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:43.621
or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"

00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:44.811
but in human terms.

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:49.420
When we put a human being in a cage
for days or weeks or months

00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:50.888
or even years,

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:53.261
what are we doing
to that person's mind and body?

00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:56.043
Under what conditions
are we really willing to do that?

00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:59.375
And so if starting with a few
hundred of us in this room,

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.443
we can commit to thinking about
jailing in this different light,
