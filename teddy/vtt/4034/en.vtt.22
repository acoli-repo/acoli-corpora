00:10:58.264 --> 00:11:01.644
even though an affluent person
would never have been in this situation,

00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:04.542
because an affluent person
would have simply been bailed out.

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.656
At this point you might be wondering,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.474
"This guy's in the inspiration section,
what is he doing --

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:10.658
(Laughter)

00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:13.488
"This is extremely depressing.
I want my money back."

00:11:13.512 --> 00:11:14.718
(Laughter)

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:17.141
But in actuality,

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:21.555
I find talking about jailing much less
depressing than the alternative,

00:11:21.579 --> 00:11:24.015
because I think if we don't talk
about these issues

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.440
and collectively change
how we think about jailing,

00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:27.968
at the end of all of our lives,

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:31.123
we'll still have jails full of poor people
who don't belong there.
