One summer afternoon in 2013,

00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:06.426
DC police detained, questioned
and searched a man

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.542

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.647
at the Public Defender Service
in Washington DC,

and I was visiting
a police station for work.

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:28.274
I was on my way out,

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.290
and before I could make it to my car,
