00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.802
and he relies on social security
payments to survive.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:32.512
When I met him in his apartment,

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.415
he had nothing of value there --
not even food in his fridge.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.604
He's chronically hungry.

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:40.107
He had nothing of value in his apartment
except a small piece of cardboard

00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.369
on which he'd written
the names of his children.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.961
He cherished this a lot.
He was happy to show it to me.

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.141
But he can't pay his fines and fees
because he has nothing to give.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:51.541
In the last nine years,
he's been arrested 13 times,

00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:55.896
and jailed for a total of 130 days
on that panhandling case.

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.707
One of those stretches lasted 45 days.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:04.137
Just imagine spending from right now
until sometime in June
