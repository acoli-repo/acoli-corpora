00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:30.143
there was a chance a police officer
would run my license plate,

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:31.858
see a warrant for unpaid debt,

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:34.012
seize my body they way the did in DC

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.953
and then take me to a jail cell,

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:37.611
I feel a little sick.

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.994
I've met many of the people in Ferguson
who have experienced this,

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:43.805
and I've heard some of their stories.

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.197
In Ferguson's jail,

00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.330
in each small cell,
there's a bunk bed and a toilet,

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.656
but they'd pack four people
into each cell.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.795
So there'd be two people on the bunks
and two people on the floor,

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.746
one with nowhere to go except
right next to the filthy toilet,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.930
which was never cleaned.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.117
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,
