00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:31.025
I never expected to be described
by my own government in these terms:

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.307
"lurking,"

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.532
"nefarious,"

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.482
And I could see
they weren't happy with me,

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.589
but I felt I had no way of knowing
what they'd want to do next.

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.510
