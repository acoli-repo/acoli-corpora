00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.678
and the center of the country,
which wants to look inwards;

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:32.981
and third,

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.521
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.911
I'm here to today to say
that all three of these propositions,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.939
all of which sound reasonable,

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.177
are not true.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.276
In fact,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.621
our US partisanship goes all the way back

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.177
to the very beginning of the republic.

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:58.510
It was geographically spatialized
in almost eerily the same way

00:00:58.534 --> 00:00:59.827
that it is today,

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.660
and it often has been
throughout US history.
