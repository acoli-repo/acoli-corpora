00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:30.454
speak out on the issues
that matter to you,

00:13:31.425 --> 00:13:33.256
get involved,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.795
make change,

00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:36.714
express you opinion,

00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:40.589
and do it with respect
and knowledge and confidence

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:43.467
that it's only by working together

00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:48.062
that the constitutional technology
can do the job that it is designed to do.

00:13:48.997 --> 00:13:50.690
Stand up for what you believe,

00:13:50.714 --> 00:13:52.813
but take a deep breath while you do it.

00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:56.413
It's going to be OK.

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:58.426
Thanks.
