00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:39.283
the president cannot get anything done

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:43.691
unless the president first of all
follows the rules of the Constitution,

00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:44.871
because if not,

00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:48.192
the courts will stand up,
as indeed has sometimes occurred,

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:51.076
not only recently,
but in the past, in US history.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.253

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:56.943
elected officials who know
they need to win election

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.412
from centrist voters,

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:02.661
also to back his or her policies
in order to pass laws.
