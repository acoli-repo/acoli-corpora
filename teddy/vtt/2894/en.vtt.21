Perhaps most significantly
was the separation of powers --

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:34.633
an extraordinary component
of the Constitution.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:37.087
The thing about the separation of powers

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.585
is that it did then and it does now,

00:10:39.609 --> 00:10:43.118
drive governance to the center.

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.438
You can get elected to office
in the United States

00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:49.430
with help from the periphery,

00:10:49.454 --> 00:10:50.734

It turns out,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.099
you actually can't govern
unless you bring on board the center.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.698
There are midterm elections
that come incredibly fast
