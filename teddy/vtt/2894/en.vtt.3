00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:32.228
of teaching us how to manage
factional disagreement

00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:34.146
where it's possible to do that,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.851
and giving us techniques
for overcoming that disagreement

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.186
when that's possible.

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.462
Now, in order to tell you the story,

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:46.750
I want to go back
to a pivotal moment in US history,

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:47.929
and that is the moment

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:51.500
when factional disagreement
and partisanship was born.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.796
There actually was a birth moment --

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.031
a moment in US history
when partisanship snapped into place.

00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:03.799
The person who's at the core
of that story is James Madison.
