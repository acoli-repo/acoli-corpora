00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.698
There are midterm elections
that come incredibly fast

00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:04.651
after a presidency begins.

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.260
Those drive presidents towards the center.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:13.473
There's a structure in which
the president, in fact, does not rule

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:14.908
or even govern,

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:18.977
but can only propose laws
which other people have to agree with --

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:22.154
another feature that tends
to drive presidents

00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:23.936
who actually want to get things done

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.150
to the center.

00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:29.785
And a glance at the newspapers today
will reveal to you

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:33.601
that these principles are still
completely in operation.
