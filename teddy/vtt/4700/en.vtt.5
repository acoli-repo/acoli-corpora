00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:30.821
and it tells you
the direction you're moving.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.440
Alright, that's half the story.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.004
That's what this stimulus means.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:35.621
It means that your brain thinks,

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.418
when it's looking at the first image,

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:40.287
that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center.

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.469
It still doesn't explain

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.792
why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards.

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.546
To understand the rest of the story,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.260
you have to understand
that our brains are slow.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.653
What you would like
is that when light hits your eye,

00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:56.487
then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:58.073
of what the world is like.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.488
But it doesn't work that way.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.195
It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created.
