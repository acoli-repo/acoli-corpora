They put these blur lines
in their cartoons

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:02.087
and it means to your brain: motion.

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.663
Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.869
The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:10.128
that has these optic blurs in them,

00:02:10.152 --> 00:02:12.769
and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:15.362
When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras,

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:17.227
like snapshot cameras,

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.116
it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.587
and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward,

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:24.254
you get all this flowing outwards.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.412
So when you take a fixation,

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:28.654
you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff,

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:30.821
and it tells you
the direction you're moving.
