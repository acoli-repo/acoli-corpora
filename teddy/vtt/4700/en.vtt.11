00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:31.351
you have a shape that's more
like this next picture.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.230
The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project,

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.569
in fact, change in this way
in the next moment.

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:41.942
So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem,

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.488
there's just two vertical lines

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:46.340
and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment,

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:47.924
so just render it as it is.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.548
But if you add cues --

00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:51.725
and this is just one of many kinds of cues

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.791
that can lead to these kinds of illusions,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.048
this very strong optic blur cue --

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.165
then you're going to perceive instead

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.743
exactly how it will appear
in the next moment.
