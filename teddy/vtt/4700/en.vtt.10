00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.929
the sides are perfectly parallel.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:04.751
But now imagine what happens
when you get closer.

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:07.292
It all flows outwards
in your visual field,

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:08.497
flowing outwards.

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.088
But when you're really close --

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.501
imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here,

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:16.227
but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this,

00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:18.206
the sides of the doorway are going up,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.268
like railroad tracks in the sky.

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:22.347
What started off as two parallel lines,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:24.804
in fact, bows outwards at eye level,

00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:27.522
and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above.

00:05:27.546 --> 00:05:28.701
So in the next moment,

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:31.351
you have a shape that's more
like this next picture.
