00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:30.317
Whenever you move,

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.515
whenever you move forward, in particular.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.992
When you move forward, you get optic flow,

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:37.960
flowing outwards in your visual field,

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.996
like when the Enterprise goes into warp.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.984
All of these objects flow outwards

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.854
and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina.

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:48.488
They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row.

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:52.395
So, this is a version
of what happens in real life

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.644
and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:58.020
In fact, cartoonists know about this.

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:00.092
They put these blur lines
in their cartoons
