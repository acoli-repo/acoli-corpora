00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.195
It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.475
And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long,

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.457
but it's a long time in normal behaviors.

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.021
If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.642
then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.140
So if you didn't correct for this delay,

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:19.994
then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you,

00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:21.408
by the time you perceived it,

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.691
you would have bumped
into it or just passed it.

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:26.015
And of course, this
is going to be much worse --

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.380
(Laughter)

00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:29.901
it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this.

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.455
Your perception is behind.
