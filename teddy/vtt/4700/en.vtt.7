00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.455
Your perception is behind.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.538
What you want is that your perception
should look like this.

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:38.095
You want your perceptions at any time T

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.632
to be of the world at time T.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.827
But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to,

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:48.028
instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.485
when light hit your retina,

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.106
it has to do something fancier.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:55.082
It can't passively respond
and create a best guess,

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:58.264
it has to create a best guess
about the next moment.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:01.412
What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second?
