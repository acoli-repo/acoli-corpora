00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:30.210
Everybody do that.

00:06:30.234 --> 00:06:31.626
Make short, stabbing motions.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.996
Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.502
your brain says,
"They're probably already moving,

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:37.813
that's why they're blurry."

00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:40.890
When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.071
faster than they should.

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.778
They shouldn't be moving that much.

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:46.572
And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this.

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:48.980
Here are the cues of motion,

00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:52.258
the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving.

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:54.603
You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it.

00:06:54.627 --> 00:06:57.678
Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be.

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.154
It's weird, right?
