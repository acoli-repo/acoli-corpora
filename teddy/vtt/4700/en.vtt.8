What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second?

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.030
Build a perception of that,

00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:07.858
because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain,

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:09.454
the near future will have arrived

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.109
and you'll have a perception
of the present,

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:13.575
which is what you want.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.754
In my research,

00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:17.795
I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.254
that have provided evidence --

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:21.207
that the brain is filled with mechanisms

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.145
that try to compensate for its slowness.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.348
And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this,

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:27.721
this just being one example.

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.134
But let me finish by saying,

00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:32.087
how exactly does this explain
this particular example?
