00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.743
exactly how it will appear
in the next moment.

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:04.712
All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present,

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:08.920
but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present.

00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:11.643
And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future,

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.887
because they're just
static images on the page,

00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.286
they're not changing like in real life.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.931
And let me just end
by showing one illusion here.

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:20.498
If I can, I'll quickly show two.

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:21.688
This one's fun.

00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:23.814
If you just fixate at the middle there,

00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:26.183
and make stabbing motions with your head,

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.871
looming towards it like this.

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:30.210
Everybody do that.
