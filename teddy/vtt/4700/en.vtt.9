00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:32.087
how exactly does this explain
this particular example?

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.192
So, the question, really, we have to ask

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:39.884
is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus,

00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:42.267
how do they change in the next moment

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:44.716
were I moving towards the center,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.573
that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving.

00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:48.959
What happens to them?

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.134
Well, let's imagine.

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:51.728
Imagine you've got a doorway.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.658
You've got a doorway.

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:56.632
Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete --

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.043
it'll be helpful in a second.

00:04:58.067 --> 00:04:59.710
When you're very far away from it,

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.929
the sides are perfectly parallel.
