Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here.

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:34.156
And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.006
that are explained by this hypothesis.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.771
I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.003
As usual in these things,

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.908
these two lines are, in fact, parallel,

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:44.989
but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.055
At the center where
those radial lines are,

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.356
it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below.

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:53.356
And this is remarkable,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.672
because it's a remarkably simple stimulus.

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:57.411
It's just a bunch of straight lines.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:00.388
Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe
