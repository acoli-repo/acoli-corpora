00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.871
Because this injury has 
so severely damaged the nervous system,

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.001
it confuses the body's normal 
nerve signaling

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:40.432
and creates sensations in limbs
that are no longer there.

00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:45.062
Doctors are now finding ways
to treat these itching anomalies.

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:49.230
In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect
the remaining limb,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.601
which the patient scratches.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.961
That creates an illusion 
that tricks the brain

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:58.608
into thinking the imaginary 
itch has been satisfied.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:02.183
Oddly enough, that actually works.
