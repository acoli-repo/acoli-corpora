00:01:56.897 --> 00:02:00.761
where it creates the feeling of an itch.

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.387
When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:10.138
causes a low level pain signal
that overrides the itching sensation.

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:15.431
It's almost like a distraction,
which creates the sensation of relief.

00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:19.698
But is there actually an evolutionary
purpose to the itch,

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:23.177
or is it simply there to annoy us?

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:28.248
The leading theory is that our skin
has evolved to be acutely aware of touch

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:32.429
so that we're equipped to deal with risks
from the outside world.
