00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:01.256
That compound, 
which we're mildly allergic to,

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.876
triggers the release of histamine,

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.985
a chemical that makes 
our capillaries swell.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.935
This enables increased blood flow,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.956
which helpfully accelerates 
the body's immune response

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.197
to this perceived threat.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:15.847
That explains the swelling,

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.777
and it's the same reason pollen
can make your eyes puff up.

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:23.544
Histamine also activates the nerves
involved in itching,

00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:27.847
which is why bug bites make you scratch.

00:01:27.847 --> 00:01:31.696
But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood.
