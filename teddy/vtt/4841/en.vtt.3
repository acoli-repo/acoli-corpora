00:01:27.847 --> 00:01:31.696
But the itchy sensation itself
isn't yet fully understood.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.429
In fact, much of what we do know

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.157
comes from studying 
the mechanics of itching in mice.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:41.057
Researchers have discovered that
itch signals in their skin

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:47.035
are transmitted via a subclass of
the nerves that are associated with pain.

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:52.678
These dedicated nerves produce a molecule
called natriuretic polypetide B,

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:56.897
which triggers a signal that's carried
up the spinal cord to the brain,

00:01:56.897 --> 00:02:00.761
where it creates the feeling of an itch.
