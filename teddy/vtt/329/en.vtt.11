00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but we must move beyond micro-hopes

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and micro-ambitions for women,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And in many places,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
they're there.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In the U.S., women-owned businesses

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
In South Korea and Indonesia,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
women own nearly half a million firms.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
China, women run 20 percent

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of all small businesses.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And in the developing world overall,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That figure is 40 to 50 percent.
