00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to some of those entrepreneurs I've met

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I went to Afghanistan in 2005

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to work on a Financial Times piece,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and there I met Kamila,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a young women who told me she had just turned down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a job with the international community

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
an astronomical sum in that context.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And she had turned it down, she said,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because she was going to start her next business,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
an entrepreneurship consultancy

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that would teach business skills

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to men and women all around Afghanistan.
