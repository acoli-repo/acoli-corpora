00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that having a decent job and earning a good living

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
made the biggest difference

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for families who were struggling.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So if you're going to talk about jobs,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if you're talking about entrepreneurs

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in conflict and post-conflict settings,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then you must talk about women,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because they are the population you have left.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was 77 percent female.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I want to introduce you

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to some of those entrepreneurs I've met

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.
