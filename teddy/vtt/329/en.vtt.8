00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
squatting in an abandoned garage,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
sewing sheets and pillow cases

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
she would take to markets all around the city

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so that she could support

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the 12 or 13 family members

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
who were counting on her for survival.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
By the time we met, she had 20 employees,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
most of them women,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who were sending their boys and their girls to school.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And she was just the start.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I met women running essential oils businesses,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
wineries

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and even the country's largest advertising agency.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So these stories together
