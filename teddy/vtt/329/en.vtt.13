can't get the capital they need to expand

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and those in microbusiness

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
can't grow out of them.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
She sells chocolates.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And she had come to Washington,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
She had come seeking serious investment dollars

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
so that she could build the factory

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and buy the equipment she needs

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to export her chocolates

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to Africa, Europe, the Middle East

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and far beyond --
