00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and far beyond --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
capital that would help her to employ

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
more than the 20 people

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that she already has working for her,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and capital that would fuel her own country's

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
economic climb.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The great news is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we already know what works.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Theory and empirical evidence

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Have already taught us.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We don't need to invent solutions because we have them --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
cash flow loans

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
based in income rather than assets,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because women often don't own land.
