00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
are pervasive,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and so are the misleading mental images.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you see the word "microfinance,"

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
what comes to mind?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Most people say women.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And if you see the word "entrepreneur,"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
most people think men.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Why is that?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Because we aim low and we think small

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when it comes to women.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but we must move beyond micro-hopes
