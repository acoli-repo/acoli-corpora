00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
for a fellowship overseas,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I would never ever, ever find another job,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The women in my family

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The women in this room and watching in L.A.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and all around the world

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
are not exceptions.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We are not a special interest group.
