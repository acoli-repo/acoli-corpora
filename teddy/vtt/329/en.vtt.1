00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I set out to write a compelling economic story,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one that had great characters, that no one else was telling,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and one that I thought mattered.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And that turned out to be women.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for business school,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a path I knew almost nothing about.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
had graduated from college,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
let alone considered business school.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But they had hustled to feed their kids

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and pay their rent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I saw from a young age

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that having a decent job and earning a good living
