00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So these stories together

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
became the Herald Tribune business cover.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And when this story posted,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to feature at your next investment conference,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
here are a couple of women."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But think about this.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The IMF official is hardly the only person

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to automatically file women under micro.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
are pervasive,
