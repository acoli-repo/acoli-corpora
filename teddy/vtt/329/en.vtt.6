00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to become breadwinners

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And at a time of economic collapse

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and windows and doors

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just to survive,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
these girls made the difference

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
between survival and starvation

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for so many.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because everywhere I went I met more of these women

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
who no one seemed to know about,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or even wish to.
