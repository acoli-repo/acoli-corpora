00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is this is an incredible opportunity.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We have so much room to grow.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So you see,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
this is not about doing good,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
this is about global growth

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and global employment.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It is about how we invest

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and it's about how we see women.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And women can no longer be

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
both half the population

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and a special interest group.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Applause)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters
