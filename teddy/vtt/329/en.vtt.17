00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Just think of the benefits

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
when it comes to jobs, productivity,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
employment, child nutrition,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
maternal mortality, literacy

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and much, much more.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
smaller gender gaps are directly correlated

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
with increased economic competitiveness.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And not one country in all the world

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
has eliminated its economic participation gap --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
not one.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So the great news

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is this is an incredible opportunity.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We have so much room to grow.
