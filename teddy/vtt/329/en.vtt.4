to men and women all around Afghanistan.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Business, she said,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
was critical to her country's future.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because long after this round of internationals left,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
business would help keep her country

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
peaceful and secure.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And she said business was even more important for women

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
because earning an income earned respect

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and money was power for women.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So I was amazed.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)
