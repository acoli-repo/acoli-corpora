00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And in the developing world overall,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That figure is 40 to 50 percent.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Nearly everywhere I go,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
who are seeking access to finance, access to markets

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and established business networks.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
They are often ignored

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because they're harder to help.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And as the World Bank recently noted,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
women are stuck in a productivity trap.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Those in small businesses

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
can't get the capital they need to expand
