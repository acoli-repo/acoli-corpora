I'm talking to you today
from my home in Brazil,

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:06.038
where I live with my wife and two kids.

00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:09.746
Let me start by asking a question
to the other parents out there.

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:14.746
Would you consider
asking a total stranger,

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:18.371
someone you've never met before,
never even seen before,

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:20.663
to meet your kids after school,

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.204
put your kids in their car --

00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:24.371
which, by the way,
you haven't seen either --

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:26.246
and drive them halfway across town?

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:30.496
Even just asking that hypothetical
question freaks me out.
