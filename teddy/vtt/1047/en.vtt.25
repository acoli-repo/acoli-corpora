00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
A great deal of them.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For a number of countries in this part of the world,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and for having some meaning

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Just take Azerbaijan.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
as a frozen basket case.
