00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the present and some maps you haven't seen

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in order to get a sense of where things are going.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's start with the world of 1945.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
After World War II, Europe was devastated,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but still held large overseas colonies:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then over the late '40s,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
waves of decolonization took place.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Over 50 new countries were born.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.
