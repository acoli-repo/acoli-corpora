Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on this screen, of the many more

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that will never leave the place in which they were born.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and often violently.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
our basic political geography.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?
