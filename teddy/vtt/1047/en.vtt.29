00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and now you have what most people consider

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
a zone of peace spanning 27 countries

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and 450 million people.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Well in light blue, you see the zones

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
or the regions that are at least two-thirds

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
or more dependent on the European Union

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
for trade and investment.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia
