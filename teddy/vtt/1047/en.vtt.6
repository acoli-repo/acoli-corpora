00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In fact, the World Bank predicts

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that Russia's population is declining

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
towards about 120 million people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000

Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders

Russian governments have invested in infrastructure

to unite the country, east and west.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But nothing has more perversely impacted

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Russia's demographic distribution,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
