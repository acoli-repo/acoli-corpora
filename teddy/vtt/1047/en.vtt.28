The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to happen in a peaceful way.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The E.U. also became a currency block,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
since the end of the Cold War.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
In fact most of that happened on just one day.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and now you have what most people consider
