00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And today, if you go to Kurdistan,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But what are they guarding?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Is it really a border on the map?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
No. It's the pipelines.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
of their own statehood.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I don't believe we should.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
behind Saudi Arabia.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It has no choice but to behave.
