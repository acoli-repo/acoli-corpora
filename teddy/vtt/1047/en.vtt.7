00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
have gotten on those trains and roads

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and gone back to the west.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
As a result, in the Russian far east today,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which is twice the size of India,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you have exactly six million Russians.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Why do they call it that?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
