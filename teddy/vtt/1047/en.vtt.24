00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and the way we're talking about it now.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Before it was, how do we control their oil?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Here are just some of the pipeline projections

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and possibilities and scenarios

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.
