00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now this is important, because border conflicts

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Border conflicts can derail

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I think we need a deeper understanding

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of how people, money, power,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
religion, culture, technology

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
interact to change the map of the world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And we can try to anticipate those changes,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and shape them in a more constructive direction.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we're going to look at some maps of the past,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the present and some maps you haven't seen
