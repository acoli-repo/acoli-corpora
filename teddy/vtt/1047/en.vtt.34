00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
If we were to look at all of Africa

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
we could most certainly acknowledge far more,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
tribal divisions and so forth.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It has three ongoing civil wars,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the civil war in the east of the country,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and south Sudan.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
There is a great race on for energy resources

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
under the Arctic seabed.
