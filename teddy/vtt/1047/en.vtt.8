China isn't conquering Mongolia.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's buying it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So let's apply this principle to Siberia.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Siberia most of you probably think of

as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,

But who is it going to feed?

Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,
