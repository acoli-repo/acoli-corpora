00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Again, globalization Chinese style.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
undermine and change the way we think about political geography.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, the history of East Asia in fact,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
people don't think about nations and borders.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
usually Chinese or Japanese.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Well it's China's turn again.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So let's look at how China is re-establishing

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that hierarchy in the far East.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It starts with the global hubs.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
