00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in terms of nations and borders,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
what you really have emerging in the far east

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
are national cultures,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
All of this is happening without firing a shot.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
where countries are still very uncomfortable

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in the borders left behind by European colonialists.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
What lines on the map should we focus on?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What I want to present to you is what I call

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
state building, day by day.
