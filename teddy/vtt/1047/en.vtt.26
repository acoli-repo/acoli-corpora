00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
as a frozen basket case.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to provide for Europe,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and even a potentially Turkmen-

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Today most people recognize Kazakhstan

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
north through Russia, and even east to China.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.
