00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Again, like Mongolia,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now maybe this is what the map of the region

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
might look like in 10 to 20 years.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but it does rhyme.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.
