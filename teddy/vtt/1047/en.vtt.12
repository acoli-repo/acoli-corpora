00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that show the hubs of the global economy?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
East Asia today has more of those global hubs

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000

These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
trade relationships that China has

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Specifically, it targets Japan
