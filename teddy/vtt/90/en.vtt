00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:04.500
It was my first year
as an atmospheric science professor

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:06.190
at Texas Tech University.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.516
We had just moved to Lubbock, Texas,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.042
which had recently been named
the second most conservative city

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.866
in the entire United States.

00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:18.600
A colleague asked me to guest teach
his undergraduate geology class.

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:19.774
I said, "Sure."

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.670
But when I showed up,
the lecture hall was cavernous and dark.

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.514
As I tracked the history
of the carbon cycle

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:29.164
through geologic time to present day,

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:33.561
most of the students were slumped over,
dozing or looking at their phones.
