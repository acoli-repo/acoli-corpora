00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.896
I've been at MIT for 44 years.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.856
I went to TED I.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.736
There's only one other person here,
I think, who did that.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.976
All the other TEDs --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.256
and I went to them all,
under Ricky's regime --

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.816
I talked about
what the Media Lab was doing,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.856
which today has almost 500 people in it.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.296
And if you read the press,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.976
last week it actually said
I quit the Media Lab.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.176
I didn't quit the Media Lab,
I stepped down as chairman --

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.896
which was a kind of ridiculous title,
but someone else has taken it on --

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.111
and one of the things
you can do as a professor
