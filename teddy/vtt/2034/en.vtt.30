they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in very short order.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So, what do we do about that?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.
