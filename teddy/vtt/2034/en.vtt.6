that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
which is two one hundredths of that budget --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --
