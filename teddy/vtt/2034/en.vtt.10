Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now the problem with all of this, getting older,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So, what are the solutions?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We don't really have mental health insurance in this country,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Something like 98 percent of all people with depression,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and I mean really severe depression

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
-- I have a friend with stunningly severe depression

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
-- this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.
