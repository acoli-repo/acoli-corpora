And in my opinion, we don't spend enough time

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Number six: biotech disaster.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
