There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And with the kind of computing power we have now,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
almost all the money that's spent on science in this country
