or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
civilization that is more intelligent than our own.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
the rainforest and start logging it.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,

even in those cases where every attempt was made
