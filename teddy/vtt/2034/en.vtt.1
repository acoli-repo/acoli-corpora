00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I should say people who write about science --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is ways the world could end very suddenly.
