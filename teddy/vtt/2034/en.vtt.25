00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
have had exactly the same thought.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This spring -- there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
this spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I hope they're right. (Laughter)
