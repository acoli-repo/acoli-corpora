In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
where there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.
