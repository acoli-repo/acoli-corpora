Last July, in Science, the journal Science,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
by a factor of 10,000.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
