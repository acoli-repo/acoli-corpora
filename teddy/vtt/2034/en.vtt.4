00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and lo and behold, we found them.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
press conference from a couple of weeks ago.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Can we run that, Andrew?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
