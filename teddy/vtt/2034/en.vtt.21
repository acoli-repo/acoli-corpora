00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.
