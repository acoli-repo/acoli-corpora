00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
We shut one down that was going to be big.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But there's talk of building very big accelerators.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
What can we do about this? What are the solutions?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
We've got the fox watching the henhouse here.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and what should be done in particle physics,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
of what's going on with these experiments.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Secondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,
