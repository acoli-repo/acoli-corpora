00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to me these are Richard's cockroaches.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I hope you take some of this stuff away with you,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and when you have an opportunity to be influential,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.
