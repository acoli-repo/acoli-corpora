00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I thought, ah, God,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
who was a neuroscientist, said,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.
