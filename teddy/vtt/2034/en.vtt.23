almost all the money that's spent on science in this country

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
comes from the federal government, one way or another.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And they get to prioritize, you know?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
There are people at the National Science Foundation

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
who get to say, this is the most important thing.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Secondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and start moving them around.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,
