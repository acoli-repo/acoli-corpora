00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
we're finding about two or three a month.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.
