00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I run a design studio in New York.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Every seven years, I close it for one year

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to pursue

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some little experiments, things that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are always difficult to accomplish

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
during the regular working year.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In that year, we are not available

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for any of our clients.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We are totally closed.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And as you can imagine,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it is a lovely and very energetic time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I originally had opened the studio in New York
