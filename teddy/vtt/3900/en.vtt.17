00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:30.424
And last year, I was asked
by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:34.280
to compose ringtones
that they were going to play.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.203
So one of them, I had the idea
to start from this sound field.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.622
I took a section,

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.408
I superimposed the section
over the distribution

00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:46.706
of the musicians onstage,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.560
and then I followed
the blooming of the sound field

00:08:49.584 --> 00:08:51.007
by means of three parameters:

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:53.785
time, intensity and frequency.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:59.858
Then I wrote down all the gradients
for each instrument,

00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:01.473
and as you can see, for instance,
