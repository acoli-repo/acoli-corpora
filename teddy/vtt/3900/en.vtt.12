00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:03.438
[Sound is memory.]

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.625
And it's not just about
the sound of a car.

00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:09.423
It's the memory of my father
coming back home.

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:13.274
[Sound is hypnotizing.]

00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:18.949
And sound has the power to create
an unexpected sense of wonder,

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:20.400
which hypnotizes.

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:23.171
And ultimately,

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:24.670
[Sound is superhuman.]

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.694
sound goes beyond the human condition,

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:29.361
because it allows us to transcend.
