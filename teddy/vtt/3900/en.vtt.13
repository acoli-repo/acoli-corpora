00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:36.845
As a second step,
we define the sonic variations.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:38.471
[Identity prism]

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:42.594
Just like humans, where different bodies
generate different voices,

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:47.872
also different car shapes
have a different acoustic behavior

00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:50.665
which depends on
the geometry and the materials.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:58.063
So we have to know, first of all,
how this car propagates the sound outside

00:06:58.087 --> 00:06:59.999
by means of acoustic measurements.
