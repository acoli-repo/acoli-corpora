00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:32.052
teeming with transience,
cross purposes and disarray.

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:36.592
And this landscape
offers a great opportunity

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:40.806
for developing new solutions
on how to reduce this chaos.

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:47.133
I have conceived a new approach
that tries to reduce the chaos

00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:48.924
by introducing harmony.

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:55.041
Since many people don't know
how an electric car could sound like,

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:59.354
I have to define, first of all,
a new sound world,

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:03.031
something that doesn't belong
to our previous experience
