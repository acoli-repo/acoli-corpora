00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.387
which we called "whistling" sound.

00:03:01.907 --> 00:03:05.249
However, if we would
just amplify this sound,

00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:09.059
we would still not be able to fulfill
the legal requirements.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:12.448
That's also why we need
to compose new sound.

00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:15.551
So how do we go after it?

00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:20.716
In many cities, the traffic
is already very chaotic,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.352
and we don't need more chaos.

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:28.298
But the streets of the 21st century
are a great case study

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:32.052
teeming with transience,
cross purposes and disarray.
