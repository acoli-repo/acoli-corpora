00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:03.031
something that doesn't belong
to our previous experience

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:05.521
but creates a reference for the future.

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:11.397
Together with a small team,
we create lots of sonic textures

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:15.159
that are able to transmit emotion.

00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:18.237
Just like a painter with colors,

00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:22.734
we are able to connect
feelings and frequencies

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.238
so that whenever one is approaching a car,

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:27.077
we can feel an emotion

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:31.007
which, besides fulfilling
the legal requirements,
