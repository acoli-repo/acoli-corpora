of how I transform
a sound field into a melody.

00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:04.562
Think that I am a violin player on stage.

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:06.332
If I would start to play the violin,

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:10.332
I would generate a sound field
which would propagate in this hall,

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:14.095
and at some point, the sound field
would hit the side walls

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:17.688
and would be scattered all over the place.

00:08:17.712 --> 00:08:19.293
And this is how it looked like.

00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:25.165

several ways of sound to hit side walls.

00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:30.424
And last year, I was asked
by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra
