Sound is one of the most
wonderful gifts of our universe.

00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:32.306
Sound is emotion

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.822
and sound is sublime,

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.648
and when it comes to cars,
sound is also information.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.536
In order to protect pedestrians

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.535
and to give acoustic
feedback to the drivers,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:50.771
governments around the world
have introduced several regulations

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.604
which prescribe the presence of a sound
for electric vehicles.

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:59.248
In particular, they require
minimum sound levels

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:01.441
at specific frequency bands
