00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.779
The absence of sound, in fact,
when it comes to cars,

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:02.088
it can be quite dangerous.

00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:04.946
Think of blind people,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.153
who can't see a car which is approaching.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.295
And now, if it's electric,
they can't even hear it.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:15.398
Or think of every one of us
as we are walking around the city,

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:19.323
we are absorbed in our thoughts,
and we detach from the surroundings.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.027
In these situations, sound can become
our precious companion.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:31.084
Sound is one of the most
wonderful gifts of our universe.
