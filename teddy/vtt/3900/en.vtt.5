I rather see it as the voice of the car.

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:38.009
And this is one of my biggest challenges,
and privileges, at the same time.

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:41.350
I design the voice of electric cars.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.279
We all know how a combustion
engine sounds like,

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:50.625
and we do actually also know
how an electric engine sounds like.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:53.435
Think of the electric tramway.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.673
As soon as it moves,

00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:58.496
it creates this ascending
high-frequency pitch sound,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.387
which we called "whistling" sound.
