00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:30.937
This was the question
that motivated our partnership

00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:32.780
with Google's Counter Abuse team,

00:10:32.804 --> 00:10:33.982
Wikipedia

00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.940
and newspapers like the New York Times.

00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:38.840
We wanted to see if we could build
machine-learning models

00:10:38.864 --> 00:10:42.470
that could understand
the emotional impact of language.

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:46.672

were likely to make someone else leave

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.070
the online conversation?

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:52.402
And that's no mean feat.

00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:53.992
That's no trivial accomplishment

00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:56.579
for AI to be able to do
something like that.

00:10:56.603 --> 00:11:00.332
I mean, just consider
these two examples of messages
