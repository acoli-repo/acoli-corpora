00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.038
And in response,

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:15.840
Google supported a few colleagues and me
to set up a new group called Jigsaw,

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:20.460

from threats like violent extremism,

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:22.562

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:30.256
and I left in the aftermath
of a violent revolution.
