Do you think you'd continue doing
the thing that you were doing?

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.291
Would you continue doing that thing
that's irritating your attacker?

00:09:36.016 --> 00:09:39.112
Online abuse has been this perverse art

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:42.604
of figuring out what makes people angry,

00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:44.760
what makes people afraid,

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.425
what makes people insecure,

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:49.516
and then pushing those pressure points
until they're silenced.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.637
When online harassment goes unchecked,

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.328
free speech is stifled.

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:57.323
And even the people
hosting the conversation

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.181
throw up their arms and call it quits,

00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:02.162
closing their comment sections
and their forums altogether.
