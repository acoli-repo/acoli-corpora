Radicalization isn't
this yes-or-no choice.

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:04.984
It's a process, during which
people have questions --

00:06:05.008 --> 00:06:08.784
about ideology, religion,
the living conditions.

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:11.574
And they're coming online for answers,

00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:13.515
which is an opportunity to reach them.

00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:16.919
And there are videos online
from people who have answers --

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.819
defectors, for example,
telling the story of their journey

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:21.426
into and out of violence;

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.937
stories like the one from that man
I met in the Iraqi prison.

00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:28.504
There are locals who've uploaded
cell phone footage

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:32.031
of what life is really like
in the caliphate under ISIS's rule.
