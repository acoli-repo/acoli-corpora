00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:32.339
"I arrived in Syria full of hope,

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:36.728
and immediately, I had two
of my prized possessions confiscated:

00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:39.685
my passport and my mobile phone."

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.546
The symbols of his physical
and digital liberty

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.330
were taken away from him on arrival.

00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:48.758
And then this is the way he described
that moment of loss to me.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:50.942
He said,

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.295
"You know in 'Tom and Jerry,'

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:57.295
when Jerry wants to escape,
and then Tom locks the door

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.475
and swallows the key

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.050
and you see it bulging out
of his throat as it travels down?"
