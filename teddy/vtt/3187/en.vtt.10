00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.050
and you see it bulging out
of his throat as it travels down?"

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:05.599
And of course, I really could see
the image that he was describing,

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:09.284
and I really did connect with the feeling
that he was trying to convey,

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.329
which was one of doom,

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.142
when you know there's no way out.

00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:15.840
And I was wondering:

00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:19.326
What, if anything,
could have changed his mind

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.590
the day that he left home?

00:05:20.614 --> 00:05:21.864
So I asked,

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:25.066
"If you knew everything that you know now

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.141
about the suffering
and the corruption, the brutality --

00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:29.580
that day you left home,

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.283
would you still have gone?"
