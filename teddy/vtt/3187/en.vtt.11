00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:37.913
And then he said,

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.938
"At that point, I was so brainwashed,

00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:44.206
I wasn't taking in
any contradictory information.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.299

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:56.476
"At that point, I think it probably

00:05:58.138 --> 00:06:01.535
Radicalization isn't
this yes-or-no choice.
