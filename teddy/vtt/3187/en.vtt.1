When I started working at Google in 2006,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.407
Facebook was just a two-year-old,

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.443
and Twitter hadn't yet been born.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:40.258
And I was in absolute awe
of the internet and all of its promise

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:41.719
to make us closer

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.039
and smarter

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:44.277
and more free.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.979
But as we were doing the inspiring work
of building search engines

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.889
and video-sharing sites
and social networks,

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:57.211
criminals, dictators and terrorists
were figuring out

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.437
how to use those same
platforms against us.
