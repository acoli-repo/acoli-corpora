00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.426
which involves keeping
a daily log of symptoms

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.864
for at least two months in a row.

00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:38.833
Many studies also exclusively focused
on white, middle-class women,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:43.479
which makes it problematic
to apply study findings to all women.

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.517
We know there's a strong
cultural component to the belief in PMS

00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:51.139
because it's nearly unheard of
outside of Western nations.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.400
Third, many studies failed
to use control groups.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.210
If we want to understand
the specific characteristics

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.730
of women who have PMS,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.932
we need to be able to compare them
to women who don't have PMS.
