00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.775
it becomes easy to question 
the competence of all women.


00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:35.594
Women have made tremendous strides
in the workforce,

00:12:35.594 --> 00:12:39.657
but still there's a minuscule number
of women at the highest echelons

00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:42.397
of fields like government or business,

00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:47.343
and when we think about
who makes for a good CEO or senator,

00:12:47.343 --> 00:12:52.462
someone who has qualities like 
rationality, steadiness, competence

00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:53.971
come to mind,

00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:57.512
and in our culture, that sounds more
like a man than a woman,

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:01.170
and the PMS myth contributes to that.
