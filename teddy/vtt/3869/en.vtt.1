Well, I am here to tell you
that scientific evidence says

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.569
neither of those assumptions is true.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.792
I'm here to give you 
the good news about PMS.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.242
But first, let's take a look
at how firmly the idea of PMS

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.634
is entrenched in American culture.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:48.210
If you examine newspaper
or magazine articles,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.552
you'll see how widely assumed it is
that everyone gets PMS.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:57.940
In an article in the magazine Redbook
titled "You: PMS Free,"

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.520
readers were informed that between 80 
to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.
