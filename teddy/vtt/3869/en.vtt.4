Over 150 different symptoms
have been used to diagnose PMS,

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.751
and here are just a few of those.

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:06.632
Now, I want to be clear here.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:09.998
I'm not saying women don't get
some of these symptoms.

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:12.622
What I'm saying is that
getting some of these symptoms

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.501
doesn't amount to a mental disorder,

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.822
and when psychologists
come up with a disorder

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.108
that's so vaguely defined,

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:24.591
the label eventually becomes meaningless.

00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:27.563
With a list of symptoms
this long and wide,

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:30.326
I could have PMS, you could have PMS,
