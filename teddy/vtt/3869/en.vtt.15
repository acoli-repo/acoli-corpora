00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.360
Research tells us that the more
a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.268
the more likely she is
to erroneously report that she has it.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.544
Let me tell you what I mean
by "erroneously."

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:41.270
You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.613
and she says yes,

00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:45.031
but then, when you have her 
keep a daily log

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.430
of psychological symptoms for two months,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.704
no correlation is found
between her symptoms

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:52.496
and time of the month.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:57.385
Another reason for
the persistence of the PMS myth

00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:00.846
has to do with the narrow boundaries
of the feminine role.
