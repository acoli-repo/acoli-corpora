readers were informed that between 80 
to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.251
L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:09.525
that 40 to 50 percent of women
suffer from PMS,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:14.169
and that it plays a major role
in women's mental and physical health,

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:17.160
and a couple of years ago,
even the Wall Street Journal

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.345
ran an article on calcium
as a treatment for PMS,

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:22.400
asking its female readers,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.489
"Do you turn into a witch every month?"

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:28.866
From all these articles, you would think
there must be a mountain of research


00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.790
verifying the widespread nature of PMS.
