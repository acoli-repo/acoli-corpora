If you've got a distinct disorder
with a distinct cause,

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.174
which PMS is supposed to be,

00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:05.982
then the treatment should bring
improvement for a great number of women.

00:10:05.982 --> 00:10:08.536
This has not been the case
with these treatments,

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:12.646
and FDA regulations say that
for a drug to be deemed effective,

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.713
a large portion of the target population

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:17.871
should see clinically
significant improvement.

00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:21.887
So we have not had that at all
with these so-called treatments.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:26.200
However, the financial gain
of perpetuating the myth

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.201
that PMS is a common mental disorder

00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:33.270
and is treatable is quite substantial.
