Individual issues like
quality of relationship or work conditions

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:35.313
or societal issues like racism or sexism
or the daily grind of poverty

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:38.657
are all strongly related to daily mood.

00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:42.420
Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.272
keeps women from understanding
the source of their negative emotions,

00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:51.640
but it also takes away the opportunity
to take any action to change them.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.469
So the good news about PMS

00:13:54.469 --> 00:13:59.205
is that while some women get some symptoms
because of the menstrual cycle,

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:02.758
the great majority don't
get a mental disorder.
