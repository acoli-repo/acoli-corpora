00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.561
and over six months of research,

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:02.852
I actually made it.

00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:11.484
(Applause)

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:15.248
I created a building block

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.569
out of the ashes and rubble
of the demolished houses.

00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:24.823
It's here, it came all the way with me.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.447
Well, it came before me.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.847
So, it's lighter,

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:32.212
it's cheaper, and it's stronger.
