But also, maybe we can use something
from inside the community,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.585
something we already had.

00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.931
I started to put things together.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:13.247
First, paper as a filler,
instead of the aggregate we import.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.243
But that did not work out.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:21.333
What about using glass powder
to replace part of the cement?

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.085
But that failed, too.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:27.571
I guessed making building blocks
out of mud would be a great idea.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.939
But unfortunately, it didn't work out.
