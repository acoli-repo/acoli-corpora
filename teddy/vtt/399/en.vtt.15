00:07:28.883 --> 00:07:31.470
One of the solar units
we installed in a refugee camp.

00:07:31.494 --> 00:07:34.405
The next day I came to check
what happened with the solar,

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:37.233
and I found a whole neighborhood
watching a football match

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.562
using our device.

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:42.685
I was like, "Wow, that's going to create
a huge impact in the community."

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.525
That encouraged us to go
to the second round

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.566
of bringing 200 units.

00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:52.815
But each unit costs around 350 dollars.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.768
And a Palestinian family
can't afford the 350 dollars.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.942
So we had to think, again,
outside the box:

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:00.656
How can we make this happen?
