00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.232
In Gaza, we have a whole lot of nothing.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:09.291
And I aim to create something
from that nothing.

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:12.403
When a community is cut off
from the world,

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:14.379
all that we need to do is ... what?

00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:16.469
To think outside the box.

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:18.624
Way outside the box.

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.127
That thinking led me to two projects

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.703
to address two serious issues
in my community.

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:33.952
The need for building materials
and the need for electricity and energy.
