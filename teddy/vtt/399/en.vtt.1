00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:34.344
For more than 10 years,
I and two million people back home

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.240
have been living in darkness,

00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:39.732
locked between two borders

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:43.507
that are nearly impossible
to leave, literally,

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:51.013
in an area that spans 25 miles long
and about five miles wide.

00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:55.164
I am Palestinian, and I am from Gaza.

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:58.503
I grew up there and I still live there.
