Those houses were made
from sunbaked stones and blocks.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.749
Those houses stood
for decades and decades.

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:39.466
Those houses were
for my family, friends, neighbors,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.769
everyone I know.

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:44.769
At that time, I asked myself a question:

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:46.460
What can I do for people?

00:02:46.952 --> 00:02:48.285
How can I help them?

00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:56.127
I knew we weren't able
to get cement, aggregate and sand

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.619
to rebuild what the war destroyed.

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:03.895
But also, maybe we can use something
from inside the community,
