00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.576
is not through more wars and more borders,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.440
but through more connectivity
of pipelines and water canals.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.976
Sadly, this is not yet
the map of the Middle East.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
But it should be,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.800
a connected Pax Arabia,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.336
internally integrated

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.656
and productively connected
to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.776
Now, it may not seem like connectivity
is what we want right now

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.840
towards the world's most turbulent region.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.216
But we know from history
that more connectivity is the only way
