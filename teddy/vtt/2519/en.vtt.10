00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.440
I believe that is what is happening.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.936
Connectivity has a twin megatrend
in the 21st century:

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.040
planetary urbanization.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.280
Cities are the infrastructures
that most define us.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.056
By 2030, more than two thirds
of the world's population

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.336
will live in cities.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.096
And these are not
mere little dots on the map,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.720
but they are vast archipelagos
stretching hundreds of kilometers.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.936
Here we are in Vancouver,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.816
at the head of the Cascadia Corridor
