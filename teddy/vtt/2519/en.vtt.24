00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.776
when we invest in robust
transportation networks

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.336
to allow people to connect to each other
both physically and digitally,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.736
that's when our divided
cities and societies

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.616
will come to feel whole again.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.480
(Applause)

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.736
And that is why infrastructure
has just been included

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.216
in the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.560
because it enables all the others.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.896
Our political and economic leaders

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.016
are learning that connectivity
is not charity,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.240
it's opportunity.
