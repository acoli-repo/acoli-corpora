00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.256
with populations
reaching 100 million people.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.176
The Bohai Rim around Beijing,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.456
The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.376
and the Pearl River Delta,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.736
stretching from Hong Kong
north to Guangzhou.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.096
And in the middle,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.016
the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.816
whose geographic footprint
is almost the same size

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.480
as the country of Austria.

00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:53.216
And any number of these megacity clusters

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.296
has a GDP approaching
two trillion dollars --

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.000
that's almost the same
as all of India today.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.216
So imagine if our global diplomatic
institutions, such as the G20,
