00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.816
has enabled such a quantum leap
in the mobility of people,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.576
of goods, of resources, of knowledge,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
such that we can no longer even think
of geography as distinct from it.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.936
In fact, I view the two forces
as fusing together

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.040
into what I call "connectography."

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.216
Connectography represents a quantum leap

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.656
in the mobility of people,
resources and ideas,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.480
but it is an evolution,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.456
an evolution of the world
from political geography,
