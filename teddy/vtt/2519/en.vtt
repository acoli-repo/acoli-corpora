00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.520
I want you to reimagine
how life is organized on earth.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.720
Think of the planet
like a human body that we inhabit.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.816
The skeleton is the transportation system
of roads and railways,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.576
bridges and tunnels, air and seaports

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.816
that enable our mobility
across the continents.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.096
The vascular system that powers the body

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.896
are the oil and gas pipelines
and electricity grids.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.120
that distribute energy.
