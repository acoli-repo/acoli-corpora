00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.736
Meanwhile, our global
infrastructure spending

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.136
is projected to rise
to nine trillion dollars per year

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.696
within the coming decade.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.336
And, well, it should.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.096
We have been living
off an infrastructure stock

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.720
meant for a world population
of three billion,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.736
as our population has crossed
seven billion to eight billion

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.600
and eventually nine billion and more.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.976
As a rule of thumb, we should spend
about one trillion dollars

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.240
on the basic infrastructure needs
of every billion people in the world.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.
