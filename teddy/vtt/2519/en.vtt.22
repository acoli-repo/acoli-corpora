00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.936
how to deploy electric
car-sharing systems.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.176
In major Chinese cities,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.256
they're imposing quotas
on the number of cars on the streets.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.536
In many Western cities,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.880
young people don't even
want to drive anymore.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.936
Cities have been part of the problem,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.960
now they are part of the solution.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.480
Inequality is the other great challenge
to achieving sustainable urbanization.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.376
When I travel through megacities
from end to end --

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.496
it takes hours and days --

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.256
I experience the tragedy
of extreme disparity

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.200
within the same geography.
