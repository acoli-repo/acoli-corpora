It is evolving
into what I call a Pax Asiana,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.240
a peace among Southeast Asian nations.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.176
A similar phenomenon
is underway in East Africa,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.576
where a half dozen countries

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.896
are investing in railways
and multimodal corridors

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.056
so that landlocked countries
can get their goods to market.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.656
Now these countries
coordinate their utilities

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.776
and their investment policies.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.600
They, too, are evolving
into a Pax Africana.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.096
One region we know could
especially use this kind of thinking
