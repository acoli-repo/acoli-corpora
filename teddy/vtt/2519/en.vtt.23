00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.096
And yet, our global stock
of financial assets

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.576
has never been larger,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.096
approaching 300 trillion dollars.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.520
That's almost four times
the actual GDP of the world.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.976
We have taken on such enormous debts
since the financial crisis,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.160
but have we invested them
in inclusive growth?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.960

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.616
Only when we build sufficient,
affordable public housing,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.776
when we invest in robust
transportation networks
