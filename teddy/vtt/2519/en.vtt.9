00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.656
we will build more infrastructure
in the next 40 years,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.440
than we have in the past 4,000 years.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.960
Now let's stop and think
about it for a minute.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.336
Spending so much more on building
the foundations of global society

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.176
rather than on the tools to destroy it

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.776
can have profound consequences.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.856
Connectivity is how
we optimize the distribution

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.456
of people and resources around the world.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.600
It is how mankind comes to be more
than just the sum of its parts.
