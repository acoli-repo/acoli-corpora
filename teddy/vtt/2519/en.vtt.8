In 2015, China announced the creation

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.000
of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.056
which together with a network
of other organizations

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.495
aims to construct a network
of iron and silk roads,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.720
stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.816

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.656
we will build more infrastructure
in the next 40 years,
