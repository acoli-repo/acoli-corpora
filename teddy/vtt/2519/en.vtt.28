00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.216
But the real promise of connectivity
is in the postcolonial world.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.576
All of those regions where borders
have historically been the most arbitrary

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.536
and where generations of leaders

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.176
have had hostile relations
with each other.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.576
But now a new group of leaders
has come into power

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.160
and is burying the hatchet.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.936
Let's take Southeast Asia,
where high-speed rail networks

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.256
are planned to connect
Bangkok to Singapore

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.176
and trade corridors
from Vietnam to Myanmar.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.736
Now this region of 600 million people
coordinates its agricultural resources

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.160
and its industrial output.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.376
It is evolving
into what I call a Pax Asiana,
