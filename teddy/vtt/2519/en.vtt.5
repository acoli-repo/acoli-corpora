00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.456
an evolution of the world
from political geography,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.280
which is how we legally divide the world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.216
to functional geography,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.816
which is how we actually use the world,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.960
from nations and borders,
to infrastructure and supply chains.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.160
Our global system is evolving

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.896
from the vertically integrated
empires of the 19th century,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.176
through the horizontally interdependent
nations of the 20th century,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.440
into a global network civilization
in the 21st century.
