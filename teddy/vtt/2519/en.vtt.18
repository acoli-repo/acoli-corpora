WEBVTT

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.096
has a GDP approaching or exceeding
one third of one half

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.280
of their entire national GDP.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.896
But equally importantly,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.776
you cannot calculate
any of their individual value

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.456
without understanding
the role of the flows of people,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.176
of finance, of technology

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.880
that enable them to thrive.

It too represents just over
a third of South Africa's GDP.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.776
But equally importantly,
it is home to the offices

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.776
of almost every single
multinational corporation
