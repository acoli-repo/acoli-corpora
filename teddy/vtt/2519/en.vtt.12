00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.816
America's northeastern megalopolis
begins in Boston through New York

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.616
and Philadelphia to Washington.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.816
It contains more than 50 million people

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.616
and also has plans
for a high-speed rail network.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.560
But Asia is where we really see
the megacities coming together.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.536
This continuous strip of light
from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.736
contains more than 80 million people

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.440
and most of Japan's economy.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.520
It is the world's largest megacity.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.360
For now.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.336
But in China, megacity clusters
are coming together

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.256
with populations
reaching 100 million people.
