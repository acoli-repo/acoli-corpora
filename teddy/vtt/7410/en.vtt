00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:04.436
When I was 12, I had a dream
to tell one million young people

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:08.836
that it is possible to close the gap
between how learning should feel like

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.956
and how it actually feels.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:14.356
All my friends went to school
out of pressure to compete

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:16.396
in gaining the highest grades,

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.796
which leads to depending
their self-worth on numbers,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.036
normalizing cheating and hating school.

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:26.036
I had this mission
because I wanted young people

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:29.116
to fight for our right
to have an education

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:33.036
that encourages us to learn
out of internal curiosity
