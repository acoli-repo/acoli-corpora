00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.212
away from what traditional
defenders of capitalism think.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.103
But even if you go to the constitution,

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:35.374
you'll notice, before the founders
even got to the First Amendment --

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:38.673
with free speech,
free religion, free press,

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:41.071
they thought about patents and copyright.

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:45.267
They talked about the government's role
in promoting arts and sciences.

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:50.058
It's the reason why I could not start
a search engine tomorrow called Goggle.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:51.440
(Laughter)

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.140
Google doesn't own Gs,

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:55.943
but I couldn't do it
because there could be some confusion.

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:58.582
So even property rights
have ambiguity built into them.

00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:00.482
And on and on.
