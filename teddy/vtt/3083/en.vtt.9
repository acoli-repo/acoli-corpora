00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.997
And all of a sudden,
this equation is going to be decoupled.

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:34.004
And when it gets decoupled,

00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:37.696
we might find that democracy,
the multitude of voices,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.156
actually impedes capitalism

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.186
because a state that does not have
any pretense of limited government

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.752
can very quickly mandate
a regulatory framework for drones,

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.219
for electric cars, for self-driving cars,

00:04:50.243 --> 00:04:52.038
for any new innovation

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.789
where they feel that they can leapfrog
Western societies.

00:04:56.792 --> 00:05:00.672
And this is a very unique thing
in the American experience.
