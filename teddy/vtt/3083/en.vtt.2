00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.537
As you have advances in hardware,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.537
you have advances in software.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.569
And the operating system needs to keep up.

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:08.529
It needs to be patched,
it needs to be updated,

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:10.458
new releases have to happen.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:13.441
And all of these things
have to happen symbiotically.

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:16.767
The operating system needs
to keep getting more and more advanced

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:18.591
to keep up with innovation.

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:22.109
And this is why, fundamentally,

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.339
when you think about it
as an operating system,

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:26.512
it devolves the language of ideology

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.212
away from what traditional
defenders of capitalism think.
