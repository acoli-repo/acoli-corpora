00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:02.047
So, what is capitalism?

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:05.261
Capitalism, fundamentally,
is a series of marketplaces.

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:07.199
You can have a marketplace for lemonade,

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:08.508
a marketplace for lemons,

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:10.911
a marketplace for trucks
that transport lemons,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.490
a marketplace that fuels those trucks,

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:16.902
marketplaces that sell wood
to build lemonade stands.

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:19.371
However, capitalism of course, as we know,

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.831
is this either celebrated term

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.006
or condemned term.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.270
It's either revered or it's reviled.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.004
And I'm here to argue
that this is because capitalism,

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.229
in the modern iteration,
is largely misunderstood.
