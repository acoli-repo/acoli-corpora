00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:33.451
you're going to see American democracy

00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:38.973
rise to meet the challenges
that capitalism poses and modernity poses.

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:42.394
And I ask policymakers to think about --

00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:47.079
decoupling ideology from economics,

00:05:47.103 --> 00:05:51.440
and think about how good policy
can ultimately become good politics.

00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:52.976
Thank you.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.407
