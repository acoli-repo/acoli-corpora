00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:31.966
the drivers of these automobiles
had to have driver's licenses, eye exams,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.696
registered motor vehicles, speed limits,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.934
rules of the road,

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.950
so that horses, pedestrians,
could coexist with cars.

00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:43.175
It had to be backwards compatible.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.697
So a new invention had to basically fit
advances from the past.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:50.180
Similarly, five or ten years from now,

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:52.995
we're going to see the same thing
with self-driving cars --

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.149
coexisting with human-driven cars.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:57.497
The reason why this is important,
is in 10 years,

00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.970
another thing is going to happen
beyond drones and self-driving cars,
