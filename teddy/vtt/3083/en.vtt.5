00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:32.752
Now all of a sudden,
it was very much relevant

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:35.450
whether your land ends
at 1,000 feet in the sky,

00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:37.243
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet.

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:40.283
And you have to have
someone arbitrate that.

00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:43.077
And indeed, that's exactly what happened.

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:44.614
And five or ten years from now,

00:02:44.638 --> 00:02:48.226
when Amazon wants to deliver a package
over your house to your neighbor

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.894
from that UPS truck,

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:53.180
we're going to have to decide:
Does you property end at five feet,

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:55.912
10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet?

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.111
Where does it end?

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.858
And there is no ideology

00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:01.447
that will tell you
where your property ends.
