00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:00.482
And on and on.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:04.862
And by 1900, you have other types
of property that come into being.

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:08.743
For instance, imagine that in 1900,
you owned 100 acres of land

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.186
someplace in the Midwest.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.804
It's very easy to see
where your fence ends,

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.462
your neighbor's property begins.

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:15.649
Now let me ask you,

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.047
where in the sky does your property end?

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.752
Does it end at 1,000 feet,

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:22.117
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet?

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.324
It makes no difference,

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:26.363
because other than the novelty
of a few hot-air balloons,

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:27.537
man couldn't fly.

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:29.798
But within three years, he could.

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:32.752
Now all of a sudden,
it was very much relevant
