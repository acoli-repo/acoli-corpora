00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.970
another thing is going to happen
beyond drones and self-driving cars,

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:04.161
but you're going to see
the most valuable economy in the world --

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:05.883
the largest economy in the world --

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:08.175
is going to be a country
run by communists.

00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:11.433
The Chinese seem to be
very good at capitalism.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.946
And this is going to have
fundamental problems

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.548
and present an identity crisis
for the United States.

00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:21.237
Because for a long time,

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:27.118
free markets coincided with liberties
such as free speech, free press,

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:28.506
free religion.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.997
And all of a sudden,
this equation is going to be decoupled.
