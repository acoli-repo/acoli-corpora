00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and it creates physical spaces,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
If people live inside of the green barrier

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and from some of the forces of nature.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Inside of the dunes we find shade.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We can start harvesting condensation,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and start greening the desert from within.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and then excavate the sand,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and we have our architecture.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We can either excavate it by hand
