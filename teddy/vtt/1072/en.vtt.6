00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We get droughts,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
increased desertification,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
crashing food systems, water scarcity,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
famine, forced migration,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
political instability, warfare, crisis.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
That's a potential scenario

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if we fail to take this seriously.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But, how far away is it?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to try and find out how far away it is.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,
