00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I only believe in opportunities.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Which is why I'll show you a threat,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and an architectural response.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The threat is desertification.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My response is a sandstone wall

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
made from bacteria and solidified sand,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
stretching across the desert.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, sand is a magical material

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of beautiful contradictions.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It is simple and complex.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It is peaceful and violent.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It is always the same, never the same,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
endlessly fascinating.
