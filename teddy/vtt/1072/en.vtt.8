00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's the kind of forced migration

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
that desertification can lead to.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you happen to live close to the desert border,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
before you have to carry your kids away,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and abandon your home and your life as you know it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And still, those extreme environments are very good places

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
if we want to stop the shifting sands.
