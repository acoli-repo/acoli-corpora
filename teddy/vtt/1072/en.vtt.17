Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
with good spatial qualities,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Now, part of the formal control over this structure

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
would be lost to nature, obviously,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
as the bacteria do their work.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I think there is really something in that articulation
