00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which you'll never have to pay again,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
one cubic meter of bacterial sand

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
would be about 11 dollars.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
How do we construct something like this?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Well, I'll quickly show you two options.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Then, a few years afterwards,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
using permacultural strategies,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we green that part of the desert.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The second alternative would be to use injection piles.
