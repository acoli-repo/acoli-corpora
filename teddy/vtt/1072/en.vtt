00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a bit funny to be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
at a conference dedicated to things not seen,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and present my proposal to build

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a 6,000-kilometer-long wall

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
across the entire African continent.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
About the size of the Great Wall of China,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this would hardly be an invisible structure.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
bacteria and grains of sand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I only believe in opportunities.
