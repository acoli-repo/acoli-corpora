00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It takes a pile of loose sand

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and it creates sandstone out of it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
A chemical process produces calcite,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
which is a kind of natural cement

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that binds the grains together.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
