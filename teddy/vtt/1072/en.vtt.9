00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
if we want to stop the shifting sands.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Four years ago, 23 African countries

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
A fantastic project, the initial plan

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
right across the African continent,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
from avalanching over its crest.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is to use some kind of sand catcher.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Trees or cacti are good for this.
