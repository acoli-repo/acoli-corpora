00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It is always the same, never the same,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
endlessly fascinating.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One billion grains of sand

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
come into existence in the world each second.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That's a cyclical process.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As rocks and mountains die,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
grains of sand are born.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some of those grains may then accumulate

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
on a massive scale,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
into a sand dune.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In a way, the static, stone mountain
