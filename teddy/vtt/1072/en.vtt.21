00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Borges said that "nothing is built on stone,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
everything is built on sand,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but we must build as if the sand were stone."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
political, practical, ethical, financial.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
is fraught with many challenges
