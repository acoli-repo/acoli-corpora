Trees or cacti are good for this.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the people in these regions are so poor

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they chop them down for firewood.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and hoping that they won't get chopped down.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It adds roughness to the dune's surface,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It provides a physical support structure for the trees,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and it creates physical spaces,
