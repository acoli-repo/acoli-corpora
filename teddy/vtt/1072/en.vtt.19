00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
architectural anti-desertification structures

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
made from the desert itself.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
by the end of the century.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
In a period of unprecedented population growth

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But, if I had something like a TED wish,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
it would be to actually get it built,
