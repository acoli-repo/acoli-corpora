00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And yet desertification

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is a major threat on all continents,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
affecting some 110 countries

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It seriously threatens the livelihoods

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of millions of people,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and especially in Africa and China.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
through unsustainable use of scarce resources.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, we get climate change.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We get droughts,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
increased desertification,
