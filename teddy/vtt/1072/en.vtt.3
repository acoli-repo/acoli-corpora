00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In a way, the static, stone mountain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
becomes a moving mountain of sand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Some are already deserts;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
others are being seriously degraded by the sand.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The name means "edge of the desert."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that major droughts brought three million people
