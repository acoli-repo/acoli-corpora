00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and we have our architecture.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We can either excavate it by hand

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
or we can have the wind excavate it for us.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But, by now, you're probably asking,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How do we glue those grains of sand together?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Bacillus pasteurii,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and marshes, and does precisely that.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It takes a pile of loose sand
