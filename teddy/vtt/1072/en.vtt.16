00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The second alternative would be to use injection piles.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and we create an initial bacterial surface.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
We then pull the piles up through the dune

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But, what should they look like?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,
