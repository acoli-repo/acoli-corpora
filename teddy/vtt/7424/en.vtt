00:00:01.036 --> 00:00:03.716
So, I was born in India.

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:09.676
This is just a small part
of my big, beautiful family there.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:14.716
I have, actually, 50,
five zero, first cousins.

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:17.196
Most of us have a couple of kids.

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:21.396
And so all of this leads me
to believe the United Nations

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:24.596
when they tell us that by 2100,

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:28.756
the world will have a population
of almost 11 billion people.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:33.796
That is, three billion more people
than the planet houses today.
