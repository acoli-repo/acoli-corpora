00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:02.562
Look all around you.

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:08.286
Whether you're in a subway, a park,
an airport, a restaurant,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.029
even at this conference,

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:13.441
all of you have a phone in your hands
or maybe in your pockets.

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:15.291
How many of you have a book?

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.465
Very few, right?

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:18.946
This is the sight that used to greet me

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.077
every time I walked out
of my office block.

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:24.752
I was surrounded by a sea
of 20-something professionals

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.243
glued to their phones.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.038
And not a single one
had a book in their hands.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.195
And this used to make me
very, very frustrated.
