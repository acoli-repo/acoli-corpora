00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:30.067
Today, it's more of an experiment
in collective dreaming.

00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:34.974
It's a year-round community,
and every August, for a single week,

00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:40.431
70,000 people power down their technology
and pilgrimage out into the desert

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:42.545
to build an anti-consumerist society

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.060
outside the bounds
of their everyday lives.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.274
The conditions are brutal.

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:49.385
Strangers will hug you,

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.152
and every year, you will swear
it was better the last,

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:57.335
but it's still ridiculous
and freeing and alive,

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.858
and the art is one thing
that thrives here.
