about as far as you can get
from the galleries of New York

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.635
and London and Hong Kong.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.484
And here, for just about
30 years, at Burning Man,

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:22.532
a movement has been forming

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:30.067
Today, it's more of an experiment
in collective dreaming.
