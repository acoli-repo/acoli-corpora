Art becomes a place
for extended interaction,

00:08:02.697 --> 00:08:05.346
and although the display
might be short-lived,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.482
the experience stays with you.

00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:13.524
Nowhere is that truer at Burning Man
than at the Temple.

00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:17.333
In 2000, David Best and Jack Haye
built the first Temple,

00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:20.804
and after a member of their team
was killed tragically in an accident

00:08:20.828 --> 00:08:22.964
shortly before the event,

00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:25.265
the building became a makeshift memorial.

00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:30.614
By itself, it's a magnificent
piece of architecture,
