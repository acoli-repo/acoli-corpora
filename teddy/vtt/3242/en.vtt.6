00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:06.301
So this is me
on the desert playa last year

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.901
with my brother, obviously hard at work.

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:10.083
(Laughter)

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.898
I'd been studying the art
of Burning Man for several years,

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:17.250
for an exhibition I curated
at the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery,

00:03:17.274 --> 00:03:21.416
and what fascinates me the most
isn't the quality of the work here,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.822
which is actually rather high,

00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:27.922
it's why people come out here
into the desert again and again

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:33.137
to get their hands dirty and make
in our increasingly digital age.
