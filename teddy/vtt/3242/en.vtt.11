00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.921
Here, under a canopy of dancing lights
set to classical music,

00:05:33.945 --> 00:05:36.423
participants could escape
the thumping rave beats

00:05:36.447 --> 00:05:38.153
and chaos all around.

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:44.122
At night, the city swarms
with mutant vehicles,

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.447
the only cars allowed to roam the playa.

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:50.122
And if necessity
is the mother of invention,

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:52.130
here, absurdity is its father.

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:53.169
(Laughter)

00:05:53.193 --> 00:05:55.492
They zigzag from artwork to artwork

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:58.944
like some bizarre, random
public transportation system,

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:00.944
pulsing with light and sound.
