00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:31.291
and take on complex projects
a single artist would never even attempt,

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:35.703
from a Gothic rocket ship that appears
ready to take off at any moment

00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:38.670
to a fairytale home inside a giant boot

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:41.393
complete with shelves
full of artist-made books,

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:43.471
a blackbird pie in the oven

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.297
and a climbable beanstalk.

00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:50.889
Skilled or unskilled, all are welcome.

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:54.567
In fact, part of the charm
and the innovation of the work here

00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:57.400
is that so many makers
aren't artists at all,

00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:59.876
but scientists or engineers

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.663
or welders or garbage collectors,
