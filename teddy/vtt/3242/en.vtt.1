00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:31.813
and you've just activated
Peter Hudson's "Charon,"

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:34.297
one of the world's largest zoetropes.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.054
This is the farthest thing
from marketable art.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:42.135
(Laughter)

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.658
It's huge, it's dangerous,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:48.011
it takes a dozen people to run,
and it doesn't go with the sofa.

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:49.036
(Laughter)

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.233
It's beautifully crafted
and completely useless,

00:00:53.257 --> 00:00:55.011
and it's wonderful.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.233
You're unlikely to see works like "Charon"
in the art-world headlines.
