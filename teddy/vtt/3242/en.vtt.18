00:08:57.192 --> 00:09:00.699
before it's set afire
on the last night of the event.

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:10.886
Every year, something compels people
from all different walks of life,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.835
from all over the world,

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:15.907
to go out into the desert and make art

00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.676
when there is no money in it.

00:09:18.997 --> 00:09:21.111
The work's not always refined,

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.596
it's not always viable,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.069
it's not even always good,

00:09:25.093 --> 00:09:29.918
but it's authentic and optimistic
in a way we rarely see anywhere else.
