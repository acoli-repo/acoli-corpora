00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:40.860
Really, the entire
encampment of Burning Man

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:44.216
could be thought of as one giant
interactive art installation

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.636
driven by the participation
of everyone in it.

00:03:47.754 --> 00:03:51.217
One thing that sets this work aside
from the commercial art world

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:54.289
is that anyone who makes work can show it.

00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:58.836
These days, around 300 art installations
and countless artistic gestures

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.146
go to the playa.
