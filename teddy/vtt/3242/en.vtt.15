searching for information,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.206
as though the entire story
of a work of art

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.329
could be contained
in that one 80-word text.

00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:40.480
But in the desert,
there are no gatekeepers

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:45.179
and no placards explaining the art,

00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:49.012
You see a work on the horizon,
and you ride towards it.

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:51.592
When you arrive, you walk all around it,

00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:53.972
you touch it, you test it.

00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:57.830
Is it sturdy enough to climb on?
Will I be impaled by it?

00:07:57.854 --> 00:07:59.887
(Laughter)

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:02.673
Art becomes a place
for extended interaction,
