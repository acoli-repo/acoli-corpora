but still, when you look at these works
and you look at the headlines,

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:33.173
you have to ask yourself,

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:36.451
"Do I care about these
because they move me,

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:39.105
or do I care about them
because they're expensive

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:40.773
and I think they're supposed to?"

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:45.724
In our contemporary world, it can be hard
to separate those two things.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.081

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:53.101
What if we redefined art's value --

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.459
not by its price tag,

00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:59.282
but by the emotional connection it creates
between the artist and the audience,

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.235
or the benefits it gives our society,
