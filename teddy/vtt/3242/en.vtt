Imagine, in the empty desert,

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:09.094

ringed in skeletons,

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:14.778
and someone invites you to come pull
a series of heavy ropes at its base,

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.750
so you walk to one side,
where a team is waiting,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.757
and you all throw your backs into it,

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.038
and you pull in turn,

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.463
and eventually, the wheel roars to life,

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:28.740
lights begin to flicker,
and the audience cheers,

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:31.813
and you've just activated
