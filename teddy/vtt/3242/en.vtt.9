00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:32.116
rugged enough to withstand
the wind and weather and participants,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.453
stimulating in daylight and darkness,

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:36.530
and engaging without interpretation.

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:42.736
Encounters with monumental
and intimate works here feel surreal.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.848
Scale has a tendency to fool the eyes.

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:49.719
What looked enormous in an artist's studio
could get lost on the playa,

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:52.388
but there are virtually no spatial limits,

00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:55.253
so artists can dream
as big as they can build.

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:59.405
Some pieces bowl you over by their grace

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:02.984
and others by the sheer audacity
it took to bring them here.
