00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:34.052
In these cynical times,

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:39.885
it's comforting to know that we're still
capable of great feats of imagination,

00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:42.575
and that when we search for connection,

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:45.742
we come together and build
cathedrals in the dust.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.847
Forget the price tags.

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.813
Forget the big names.

00:09:50.837 --> 00:09:54.458
What is art for in our contemporary
world if not this?

00:09:56.081 --> 00:09:57.232
Thank you.

00:09:57.256 --> 00:10:04.256
