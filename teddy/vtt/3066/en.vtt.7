They pretty much underpin our existence.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.816
And they need to know so much,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.256
yet most lack knowledge

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.016
on livestock disease
prevention and treatment.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.176
So how do they learn?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.976
Apart from shared experiences,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.256
trial and error,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.400
conventional farming extension services
are boots on the ground and radio --

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.800
expensive and hard to scale
in the face of population growth.
