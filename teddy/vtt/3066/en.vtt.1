00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.336
Nutritional stunting manifests itself

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.216
in a reduction of growth rate
in human development.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.176
And according to UNICEF,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.816
stunting doesn't come easy.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.456
It doesn't come quickly.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.296
It happens over a long period of time

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.800
during which a child endures painful
and debilitating cycles of illness,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.336
depressed appetite,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.936
insufficient nutrition

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.560
and inadequate care.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.000
And most kids simply
can't endure such rigors.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.360
But those that do survive,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.976
they carry forward
long-term cognitive problems
