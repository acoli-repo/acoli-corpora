00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.976
they carry forward
long-term cognitive problems

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.120
as well as losses of stature.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.856
The numbers of stunted children
under the age of five,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.336
in most regions of the world,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.896
has been declining.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.936
And I really hate to say this,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.856
but the only place where
they haven't been declining is here,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.080
in Africa.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560
Here, 59 million children,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.656
three in 10 in that age group,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.536
struggle to meet
their genetic potential --

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.120
their full genetic potential.
