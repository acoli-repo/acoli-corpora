Farmers receive three SMSs a week
on best livestock practices,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.776

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.840
The first increases in productivity,

Farmers store their messages,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.696

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.760

agricultural manuals into the fields.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.896
We recognize that we are all
part of the global food network:
