Most protein consumed
on the African continent is crop-based.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.920
And although we have millions
of smallholder farmers rearing animals,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.160
livestock production
is not as easy as we think.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.896
The big livestock gaps between
rich countries and poor countries

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.440
are due to poor animal health.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.136
Endemic livestock diseases,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.536
some of them transmissible to humans,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560
threaten not only livestock producers
in those poor countries,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.520
but all human health across all countries.
