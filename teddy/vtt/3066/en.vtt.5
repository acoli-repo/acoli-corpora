00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.576
This is a global pathogens network.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.096
It shows the pathogens
found across the world

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.496
according to the Enhanced
Infectious Diseases database.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.256
And it shows those pathogens
that share hosts.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.576
In a nutshell,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.056
we share pathogens, and thus diseases,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.496
with the species we live closest to:

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.776
our livestock.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.056
And we call these zoonotic diseases.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.856
Recent reports show

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.936
that the deadly dozen zoonotic
diseases kill 2.2 million people

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.960
and sicken 2.4 billion people annually.
