breeding records and feeding records --

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.776
to the ADGG platform.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.936
This stage is synthesized
through algorithms

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.496
from some of the top
livestock institutions in the world

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.296
before it lands back in the farmers' hands

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440
in actionable SMSs.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.736
Customized data,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.336
customized responses

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.016
all aimed at increasing productivity

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.960
based on the potential on the ground.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.160
We're at a very interesting place
in agriculture in Africa.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.176
By the end of this year,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.440
we'll have almost one billion
mobile phone subscriptions.
