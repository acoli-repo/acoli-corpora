Protein is one of our most important
dietary requirements,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.776
and evidence shows
that lack of essential amino acids,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.576
the building blocks of proteins,
in young children's diets,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.840
can result in stunting.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.576
Essential amino acids are called essential

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.136
because we can't
synthesize them in our bodies.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.840
We have to get them from our foods

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.616
and the best sources are animal-derived:

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.960
milk, meat and eggs.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.016
Most protein consumed
on the African continent is crop-based.
