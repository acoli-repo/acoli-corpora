she would force me
beyond the simple categories

00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.380
I had constructed for the world.

00:10:03.404 --> 00:10:06.225
I remember talking with her

00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:07.427
with Porter Wagoner.

as, like, a type: classic,

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.406
trying to hold her back.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.464
