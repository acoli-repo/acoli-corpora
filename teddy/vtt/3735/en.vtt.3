that I would generally bring in
the beautiful music, as I just did,

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.010
and you'd start to get that warm feeling.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:34.816
A feeling, that we know from science,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.760
kind of localizes in your head and chest

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.237
and spreads through your body.

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.879
It's that feeling of wonder.

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:43.143
From 2002 to 2010,
I did hundreds of these stories.

00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:48.138

into that feeling of wonder.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.419
And I began to see that as my job,

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:55.817
to lead people to moments of wonder.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.753
What that sounded like was:

00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:01.585
(Various voices) "Huh!" "Wow!" "Wow!"
