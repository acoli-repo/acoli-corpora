00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:01.300
Like, what literally kept happening
is we'd be, you know, telling a story,

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:03.507
cruising along,
two viewpoints in conflict,

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:06.229
you get to the end and it's just like --

00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:07.404
No, let me see.

00:05:07.428 --> 00:05:08.721
What do I say at the end?

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:09.896
Oh, my God.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.951
What do you -- how do you end that story?

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:13.745
You can't just happily-ever-after it,

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:15.277
because that doesn't feel real.

00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.451
At the same time,

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:18.864
if you just leave people
in that stuck place,

00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:20.729
like, "Why did I just listen to that?"

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.309
Like, it felt like there had to be
another move there.

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.943
Had to be a way beyond the struggle.

00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:29.772
And this is what brings me to Dolly.
