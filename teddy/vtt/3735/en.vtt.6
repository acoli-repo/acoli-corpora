00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:00.632
One story in particular,

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:04.673
where we interviewed
a guy who described chemical weapons

00:03:04.697 --> 00:03:07.325
being used against him
and his fellow villagers

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.587
in the mountains of Laos.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:10.547
Western scientists went there,

00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.140
measured for chemical weapons,
didn't find any.

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:14.791
We interviewed the man about this,

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:16.449
he said the scientists were wrong.

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:17.878
We said, "But they tested."

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:20.362
He said, "I don't care,
I know what happened to me."

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:22.537
And we went back and forth
and back and forth,

00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:24.449
and make a long story short,

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.167
the interview ended in tears.

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.131
I felt ...

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:29.901
I felt horrible.
