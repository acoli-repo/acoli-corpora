This genre that I've always felt so

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:33.460
having nothing to do
with where I came from

00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:36.332
is actually made up of instruments
and musical styles

00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:38.285
that came directly from the Middle East.

00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:42.086
In fact, there were trade routes
that ran from what is now Lebanon

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.534
right up into the mountains
of East Tennessee.

00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:48.816
I can honestly say, standing there,
looking at her home,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.967

like I'm a Tennessean.

00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:54.424
That is honestly true.

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:56.489
And this wasn't a one-time thing,

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:57.877
I mean, over and over again,

00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:01.830
she would force me
beyond the simple categories
