00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:30.770
But how do you do that?

00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:34.070
I think for me, now, the answer is simple.

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:36.443
You interrogate those differences,

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:38.991
you hold them for as long as you can,

00:11:39.015 --> 00:11:42.189
until, like up on that mountain,

00:11:42.213 --> 00:11:43.414
something happens,

00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:45.105
something reveals itself.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.705
Story cannot end in difference.

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:49.544
It's got to end in revelation.

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.999
And coming back
from that trip on the mountain,

00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:56.435
a friend of mine gave me a book
that gave this whole idea a name.

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:59.450
In psychotherapy,
there's this idea called the third,

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:01.064
which essentially goes like this.
