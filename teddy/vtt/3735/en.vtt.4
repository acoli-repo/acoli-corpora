(Various voices) "Huh!" "Wow!" "Wow!"

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:03.259
"That's amazing."

00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:05.316
"Whoa!" "Wow!"

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.371
JA: But I began to get
kind of tired of these stories.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.673
I mean, partially, it was the repetition.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.387
I remember there was a day
I was sitting at the computer,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.807
making the sound of a neuron.

00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:15.982
(Crackling sound)

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:19.325
You know, take some white noise,
chop it up, very easy sound to make.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.214
I remember thinking,
"I have made this sound 25 times."

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.252
But it was more than that --

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:27.443
there was a familiar path
to these stories.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.959
You walk the path of truth,
which is made of science,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.133
and you get to wonder.
