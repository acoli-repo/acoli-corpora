00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:32.777
Or Saint Dolly, as we like
to call her in the South.

00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.445
I want to tell you about one little
glimmer of an epiphany that I had,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.631
doing a nine-part series
called "Dolly Parton's America" last year.

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:41.336
It was a bit of a departure for me,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.539
but I just had this intuition
that Dolly could help me

00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:46.316
figure out this ending problem.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.094
And here was the basic intuition:

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:49.396
You go to a Dolly concert,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.118
you see men in trucker hats
standing next to men in drag,

00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:54.031
Democrats standing next to Republicans,

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.206
women holding hands,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.483
every different kind of person
smashed together.

00:05:57.507 --> 00:06:00.372
All of these people that we are told
should hate each other
