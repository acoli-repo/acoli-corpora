00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:31.265
and spellbinding spectacles in nature,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.384
because, you have to keep in mind,
it is absolutely silent.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.068
Jad Abumrad: Like this guy,
mathematician, Steve Strogatz,

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:38.504
and he would paint a picture.

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.827
SS: Picture it.
There's a riverbank in Thailand,

00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:42.424
in the remote part of the jungle,

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:44.861
you're in a canoe,
slipping down the river.

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:46.956
There's no sound of anything,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.273
maybe the occasional, you know,
exotic jungle bird or something.

00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:52.622
JA: So you're in this imaginary
canoe with Steve,

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:56.177
and in the air all around you
are millions of fireflies.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:01:00.296
And what you see is sort of
a randomized starry-night effect.
