00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:01.064
which essentially goes like this.

00:12:01.406 --> 00:12:04.667
Typically, we think of ourselves
as these autonomous units.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.356
I do something to you,
you do something to me.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.197
But according to this theory,
when two people come together

00:12:10.221 --> 00:12:12.769
and really commit to seeing each other,

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:15.427
in that mutual act of recognition,

00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:17.539
they actually make something new.

00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:20.229
A new entity that is their relationship.

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:25.095
You can think of Dolly's concerts
as sort of a cultural third space.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.825
The way she sees all the different
parts of her audience,

00:12:27.849 --> 00:12:29.039
the way they see her,

00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:31.927
creates the spiritual
architecture of that space.
