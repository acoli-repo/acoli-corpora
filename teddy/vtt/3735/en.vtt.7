Like, hammering at a scientific truth,
when someone has suffered.

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:36.997
That wasn't going to heal anything.

00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:41.589
And maybe I was relying
too much on science to find the truth.

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.776
And it really did feel, at that moment,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.879
that there were a lot
of truths in the room,

00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:47.838
and we were only looking at one of them.

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:50.053

better at this."

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:51.648
And so for the next eight years,

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:55.230
I committed myself to doing stories
where you heard truths collide.

00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:57.394
We did stories
about the politics of consent,

00:03:57.418 --> 00:04:00.299
where you heard the perspective
of survivors and perpetrators
