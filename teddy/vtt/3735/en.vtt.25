WEBVTT

00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:31.927
creates the spiritual
architecture of that space.

00:12:33.293 --> 00:12:35.626
And I think now that is my calling.

00:12:36.237 --> 00:12:37.816
That as a journalist,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.729
as a storyteller,

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:41.681
as just an American,

00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:45.094
living in a country struggling to hold,

00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:48.094
that every story I tell
has got to find the third.

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.342
That place where the things
we hold as different

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:54.504
resolve themselves into something new.

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:56.942
Thank you.
