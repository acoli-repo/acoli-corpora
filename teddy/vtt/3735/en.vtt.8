00:03:57.418 --> 00:04:00.299
where you heard the perspective
of survivors and perpetrators

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.530
whose narratives clashed.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:02.807
We did stories about race,

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.457
how black men are systematically
eliminated from juries,

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.305
and yet, the rules that try
and prevent that from happening

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.529
only make things worse.

00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:12.093
Stories about counter terrorism,
Guantanamo detainees,

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.893
stories where everything is disputed,

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:16.258
all you can do is struggle
to try and make sense.

00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:18.964
And this struggle
kind of became the point.

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.427
I began to think, "Maybe that's my job."

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.444
To lead people to moments of struggle.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.483
Here's what that sounded like:

00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.594
(Various voices) "But I see -- I, like --"

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:29.919
"Uh, I --" (Sighs)

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.935
"Well, so, like, huh --"
