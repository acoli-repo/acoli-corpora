WEBVTT

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.154
"Am I not the right person
for this project?"

00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:32.641
But then ...

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:34.447
twist of fate.

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:36.301
We meet this guy, Bryan Seaver,

00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.562
Dolly's nephew and bodyguard.

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:41.959
And on a whim, he drives
producer Shima Oliaee and I

00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:43.261
out of Dollywood,

00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:45.269
round the back side of the mountains,

00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:46.697
up the mountains 20 minutes,

00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:48.150
down a narrow dirt road,

00:07:48.174 --> 00:07:51.366
through giant wooden gates
that look right out of "Game of Thrones,"

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.921
and into the actual
Tennessee Mountain Home.

00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.397
But the real place.

00:07:58.421 --> 00:07:59.575
Valhalla.

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.176
The real Tennessee Mountain Home.
