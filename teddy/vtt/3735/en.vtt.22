He didn't know how many dreams I had.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.285
JA: In effect, she kept telling me,

00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:05.332

But increasingly, in this confusing world,

00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:29.213
we need to be the bridge
between those differences.

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:30.770
But how do you do that?
