00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.416
And businesses can do it
in three simple ways.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.056
The first is with a policy.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.976
A policy that clearly says,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.416
the company prohibits
sex-buying during work,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.120
with company resources or on company time.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.176
That's right.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.296
I'm saying that your handbook
has to specifically give an example

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.656
that says no sex-buying
while you're traveling,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.760
at the international trade show,
because that's where it's happening.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.976
Now, a policy is only as good
as its enforcement and its communication.
