This crime knows no age,
gender or socioeconomic barrier.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.416
I'm talking about the 16-year-old girl
that I met in Washington, DC.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.336
She had been trafficked
from the time she was 14 until she was 16.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.656
She was a victim
of the foster care system.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.280
And she told me she'd been sold
up to five times a day.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.616
She didn't even know
the term "human trafficking;"

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.400
she thought that it was just
a part of her life as a foster care kid.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.256
Sex trafficking also shows up
in affluent areas and gated communities.
