WEBVTT

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.176
This Colorado-based organization
had web-based support and materials

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.336
that we gave to our truck drivers

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.456
that gave them exactly what they needed
to spot the red flags.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.280
Like, hearing CB chatter on their radios
about girls at nearby exits.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.456
Or, seeing underaged women
emerging from vehicles

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.560
in the truck stop parking lots.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.576
When we rolled out this training,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.576
a few brave drivers admitted
they had seen these women,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.656
knocking on the cabs in the truck stops,
looking for customers.
