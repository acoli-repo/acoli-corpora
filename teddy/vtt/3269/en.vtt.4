00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.216
because the conversation
would turn from curiosity:

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.016
"Really? This happens here?"

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.440
to empathy: "Wow, we've got
to do something about that."

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:15.616
To blame: "You're not telling me that
every prostitute is a victim, are you?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.616
I mean, don't they know
what they're getting into?"

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.176
I get it, I understand
why people are confused.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.616
So, to be clear,
the people that I'm talking about

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.456
do not choose this life.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.136
They're forced, defrauded or coerced.
