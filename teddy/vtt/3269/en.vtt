A few years ago,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.816
I got a call from the highest ranking
legal official in the state of Georgia:

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.696
the attorney general.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.200
That moment was a wake-up call.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.335
It was 2013, and the city of Atlanta

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.136
was hosting the Final Four
basketball tournament.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.656
The AG called to ask

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.216
if the company that I worked for
could help sponsor billboards

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.176
that would be put up around the city

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.920
as part of an anti-human
trafficking campaign.
