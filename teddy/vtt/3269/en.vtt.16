Our company has more than 100,000 drivers

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.256
all over the country, all over the world.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.416
And so it made perfect sense
to train them to see the red flags.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.856
We don't want them jumping out there
and doing things on their own,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.096
so we want them to call
a phone number, the hotline,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.160
and let law enforcement intervene.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.136
So to do this, we teamed up

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.656
with an organization
called Truckers Against Trafficking.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.176
This Colorado-based organization
had web-based support and materials
