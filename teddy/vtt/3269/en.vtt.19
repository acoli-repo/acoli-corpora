00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.536

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.016
about the underlying issues
fueling demand.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.416
Because sometimes, Johns don't even know

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.960

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.856
or a secret sauce or resource
that they can bring

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.216
to fight human trafficking.
