00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.497
You see, I'm a lawyer
and I needed some evidence.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.204
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:37.078
that I stood up and I walked around
to where she was sitting

00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:39.992
so that I could look
over her shoulder and verify

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:42.121
what was written
on the page in front of her.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.347
(Laughter)

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:44.958
Malignant carcinoma.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:49.188
But still not wanting
to believe it, I said,

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:54.813
"Now, malignant carcinoma,
you're sure that means cancer?"

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:56.043
(Laughter)

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:57.734
She told me she was sure.

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:02.876
Back at work, I handed over
the urgent things that needed to be done
