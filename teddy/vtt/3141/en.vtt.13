00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:33.244
And then there were the tricks
for managing my workflow.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.477
I scheduled chemo for first thing
on a Monday morning.

00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:40.243
I knew that from the time
I left the cancer care unit,

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:44.696
I had about four hours
before this fog screen would come down

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.560
and I would start to be sick.

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:51.037
So I would use that time to clean my inbox
and make any urgent calls.

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.882
The worst of the sickness would be gone
within about 48 hours.

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:58.466
And then I would log back
into work from home.
