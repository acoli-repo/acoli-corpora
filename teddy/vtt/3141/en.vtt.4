00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.569
that would make me feel valuable and human

00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:03.388
at times when I would have
otherwise felt like a statistic.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.553
That it would be my job
that would give me routine and stability

00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:11.402
when I was dealing with so many
difficult personal decisions

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:12.998
and so much uncertainty.

00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:17.155
Like, what sort of breast
reconstruction I was going to have.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.299
And at a time like that,

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:23.877

to my family and friends for support.

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.607
And yes, of course I did that.

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.735
But it would ultimately be my colleagues

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:34.132
who would play a huge role
in my day-to-day life.
