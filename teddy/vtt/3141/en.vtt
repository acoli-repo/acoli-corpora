It was June 2014.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.063
I was 30 years old,

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.229
and I received a call
from my doctor's office

00:00:09.253 --> 00:00:11.320
to say my test results were in.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.833
So I walked up to see her
in my lunch break, and my doctor said

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.512
she was very sorry to tell me
that I had breast cancer.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.688
I didn't want to believe her
and at first, I didn't.

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.497
You see, I'm a lawyer
and I needed some evidence.
