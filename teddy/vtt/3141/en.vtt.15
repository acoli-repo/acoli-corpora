00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.014
I got the impression they didn't want
to put any extra pressure on me

00:07:30.038 --> 00:07:31.791
while I was going through treatment.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:34.522
And while I appreciated the sentiment,

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:36.679
I actually needed the deadlines.

00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:39.839
To me, that was something
within my control

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:42.807
and something
that could stay in my control

00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.990
when there were so many
things that couldn't.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.148
And as I was working from home,

00:07:48.172 --> 00:07:51.609
I was thinking about how employers
should be applying this concept

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:54.005
of reasonable adjustments
in our current age,

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:58.014
where one in two Australian men and women

00:07:58.038 --> 00:08:01.204
will be diagnosed with cancer
by the age of 85.
