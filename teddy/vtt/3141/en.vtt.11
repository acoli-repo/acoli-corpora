00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:33.045
I was fortunate to have
a supportive manager

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.887
who was happy to see
how things went as we went along,

00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.008
rather than requiring
a concrete plan up front.

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.887
I was lucky that while
he may not have even known

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.641
about this concept
of reasonable adjustments,

00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:50.363
to him, it was just common sense.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.474
But I've learned that it's not
common sense to everyone.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:59.926
Everyone going through treatment
will learn how it impacts them

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.743
and what their limitations are.
