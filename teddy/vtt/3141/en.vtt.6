00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.325
and it did make getting ready
in the mornings very easy.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.696
(Laughter)

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.339
But in little moments like this,
I appreciated what their support meant,

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:09.537
and I wondered what I would
have done without that network.

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:14.874
I've spoken with so many people,
women in particular,

00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:17.771
who haven't had the chance
to have that network

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:21.771
because they haven't been given
the opportunity to work through treatment.

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.740
And there are several reasons for this.

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:29.585
But I think it mostly comes down
to overly paternalistic employers.
