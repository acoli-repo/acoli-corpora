00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:32.507
I knew the obvious impacts
my diagnosis was going to have on work.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.341
Medical appointments would be scheduled
during business hours,

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:40.715
and I knew that I would need time off
to recover from surgical procedures.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.919
Again, being a typical lawyer,

00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:47.815
I had done my due diligence
on what to expect from treatment.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.816
Admittedly, a lot of that
was through Doctor Google,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.875
perhaps not my best move
and I wouldn't recommend that.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.045
(Laughter)

00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:58.349
But while I was ready
for all the physical side effects,

00:04:58.373 --> 00:05:01.798
what really scared me
was this thing called chemo brain.
