00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:00.545
So what should be
a manager's first response

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:02.983
when somebody says that they're sick

00:10:03.007 --> 00:10:05.769
and they don't know
how it's going to impact their work?

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.688
It must be this:

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:12.490
"To the extent that you
are able, and want to,

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:14.847
we would love to work out
an arrangement for you

00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:16.957
to continue to work through treatment."

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:21.446
We need to start positively engaging
people with serious illness

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.970
to keep them in the workforce,

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:27.127
rather than paternalistically
pushing them away.

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:32.344
I've told you my story
because I want you to know the benefits
