00:04:58.373 --> 00:05:01.798
what really scared me
was this thing called chemo brain.

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:06.234
Chemo brain presents itself
through memory loss,

00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:08.455
an inability to concentrate

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.813
and an inability to solve problems.

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:12.988
And if this happened to me,

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.806
I wondered how I was going to do
my job as a lawyer.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:18.209
Would I be forced to leave work?

00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:23.273
And how could I possibly
have a discussion with my manager

00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.196
about reasonable adjustments
to my working arrangements

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.736
when I didn't know
how I was going to be impacted?

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:33.045
I was fortunate to have
a supportive manager
