00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.815
So I started to look into
what an employer is required to do

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.545
when someone presents
with a cancer diagnosis.

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.243
I discovered that under Australian law,
cancer is considered a disability.

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:13.248
So if you are unable to perform
your usual work duties,

00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:17.192
your employer is obligated
by the Disability Discrimination Act

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:20.315
to make reasonable adjustments
to your working arrangements,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.783
so that you can continue to work.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.880
What would reasonable
adjustments look like for me?

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:32.507
I knew the obvious impacts
my diagnosis was going to have on work.
