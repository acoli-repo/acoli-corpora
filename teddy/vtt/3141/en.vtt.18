00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:02.427
"Oh no, don't come back to work
until you're better."

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:05.133
And a light went on for me.

00:09:05.903 --> 00:09:07.975
It must be compulsory for managers

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:11.236
to have to have these conversations
with their employees.

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:14.133
And lessons from people like me,

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:17.061
that have really benefited
from working through treatment,

00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:19.085
need to be more widely shared.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.934
And I thought about what could be done
to guide these conversations,

00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.561
and then an amazing
colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn,

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:29.958
developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.
