This treatment continued
and I knew what to expect.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.649
I was able to set reasonable expectations
with my business partners

00:07:06.673 --> 00:07:08.562
about what I could do

00:07:08.586 --> 00:07:10.778
and the time frames that I could do it in.

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:15.418
But I still remember
the hesitation in their voices

00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:17.649
when it came to asking for things.

00:07:17.673 --> 00:07:20.498
And asking me to do things
by a certain time.

00:07:20.522 --> 00:07:22.516
And trust me, these were people

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.807
that were not afraid
of setting a good deadline.

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:25.986
(Laughter)

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.014
I got the impression they didn't want
to put any extra pressure on me
