just offering a longer break
or a comfier chair to sit in,

00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:35.972
although those things might be good, too.

00:08:36.854 --> 00:08:38.164
At the very least,

00:08:38.188 --> 00:08:41.433
we need to be applying
the flexibility policies and strategies

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:43.268
we've developed for other scenarios,

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:46.535
like for people
with family responsibilities.

00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:52.331
But how can we ensure that people
are even having a conversation

00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:55.760
about what reasonable adjustments
might look like for them

00:08:55.784 --> 00:08:58.823
if a manager's first response is to say,

00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:02.427
"Oh no, don't come back to work
until you're better."
