00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.743
and what their limitations are.

00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:04.934
And they'll learn to adjust for that.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.615
So for me, there were the tips and tricks
that I learned about the treatment itself,

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.369
like, before you go to chemo,

00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:13.702
you need to make sure
you're really well hydrated

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:17.107
and that you're warm, because it helps
the nurses to find your veins.

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:20.418
And make sure that you don't eat
any of your favorite food,

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:22.395
either before or after chemo,

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.688
because you're going to be
throwing that up

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:26.814
and you won't ever
want to look at it again.

00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:28.028
(Laughter)

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:29.607
I learned that one the hard way.
