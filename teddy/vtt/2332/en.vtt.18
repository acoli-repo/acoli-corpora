00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:03.204
I designed a picture exhibition
on the schoolyard

00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:07.279
showing them their children
playing together through the fence.

00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:08.761
At the end of this exhibition,

00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:11.733
I asked people to write down
their thoughts, ideas and wishes

00:09:11.757 --> 00:09:13.091
on these big wooden boxes,

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.869
and I labeled the boxes
with, "What do you think?"

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:19.144
A lot of people wrote "Yes" on it.

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:21.144
Yes, what?

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:25.267
I never mentioned my opinion
or an action that should follow,

00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.931
so which question
were they answering with yes?

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:30.759
When I asked, they said yes,
the fence should go.
