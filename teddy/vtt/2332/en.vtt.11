00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.819
will never get the opportunity
to even make a friend on the other side.

00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:35.265
School should be the place
where children, all children,

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.960
come together and learn --

00:05:36.984 --> 00:05:39.575
learn from the teacher,
but more importantly,

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:40.851
learn from each other.

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:44.309
And the more diversity,
the more there is to learn.

00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.648
In fact, school might be
the only time in our lives

00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:52.105
where establishing a contact despite
social differences is even possible.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.826
Separating children during
this time of their development

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.999
will make integration extremely difficult,

00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:01.004
if not impossible.
