00:09:57.648 --> 00:10:00.140
The mental wall started to crumble.

00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:02.909
I chose the word "crumbling,"

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:06.133
because breaking a mental wall
is a long journey,

00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:09.211
and breaking a mental wall
can be a lot more difficult

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:11.907
than simply tearing down the physical one.

00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:14.772
We have to challenge
our opinion and beliefs

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.418
and maybe even admit our own wrongs.

00:10:18.012 --> 00:10:21.550
So what happened in Brussels
was a big step,

00:10:21.574 --> 00:10:25.664
a step that has been taking
generations in Germany.

00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:29.173
There are many examples
from all over the world

00:10:29.197 --> 00:10:33.471
telling the same story I experienced
in Brussels and Germany,
