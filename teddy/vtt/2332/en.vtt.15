00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:30.408
was that I wanted to change something
about the situation.

00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:34.795
I wanted to show both sides again
how much they have in common.

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:37.875
For children, this isn't very hard,

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:40.348
because even though
one schoolyard speaks Dutch

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:44.259
and the other schoolyard, a mix
of French, Turkish and Arabic,

00:07:44.283 --> 00:07:47.100
they all speak the universal
language of play.

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.051
And it turned out the desire to play

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:53.750
is a lot stronger than all
the supposed differences between them.

00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:56.285
I installed different games at the fence,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.031
which turned it into an interface,
a common ground,

00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:00.478
instead of a barrier.
