I would love to take this
as a serious indication

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.615
that there could be a future
without a mental wall dividing Germany,

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.845
but I think we have to face reality:

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.923
this one wall could be disappearing,

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:12.333
but in the meanwhile,
a billion others are constructed.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.638
One global trend
we are currently experiencing

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.231
is the rise of gated communities.

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:23.829
And in a way, gated communities can be
seen the same exact way as countries,

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:25.854
just on the small scale --

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:28.458
neighborhoods surrounded
by walls and fences

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:31.722
to protect citizens from other citizens --
