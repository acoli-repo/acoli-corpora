00:07:59.055 --> 00:08:00.478
instead of a barrier.

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:03.397
And all of a sudden,
children were drawing together,

00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:04.900
exchanging pencils

00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:06.596
and talking on the phone.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.990
Especially the phones
were a great success,

00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:10.368
because they were so amazed

00:08:10.392 --> 00:08:13.468
by the fact that they can hear
the other side through this device

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.459
that they couldn't stop speaking.

00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:20.472
In the case of an elementary school,
parents play a very big role

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:24.278
in shaping the everyday life
and the environment of their children.

00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:26.601
So I knew that if I wanted
to make a difference,

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:29.562
I had to somehow show them, too,
how much they have in common

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:30.970
with the other side.
