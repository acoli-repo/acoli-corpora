But then he quickly added
that the fence should stay,

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:35.664
because the other side is mean
and they never give back his ball.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:39.129
It's funny, because I talked
to children from both sides,

00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:41.813
and everyone told me
that the other side is mean

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:44.681
because they never give back the ball.

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:47.409
The children on both sides
dislike each other,

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:51.298
and there are regularly arguments
breaking out at this fence,

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:54.131
which is also the main reason
why people feel the need

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:55.345
for it to be there:

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.346
it protects the children from each other,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.542
or at least their toys,

00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:00.530
and it prevents chaos.
