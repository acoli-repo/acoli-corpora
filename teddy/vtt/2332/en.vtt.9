00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:31.722
to protect citizens from other citizens --

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:35.091
and the only difference is,
it's by choice.

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:38.556
But the physical and mental effects
on the people living inside

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.839
and the people kept outside

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.148
are the same,

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:45.132
separating cities, neighborhoods

00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:47.083
and even playgrounds.

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.609
In the spring of last year,
I worked on a design project in Brussels

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.500
at two elementary schools
where this was the case.

00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:57.986
Both the schools share an entrance
and the schoolyard.

00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:00.170
Both schools teach in Dutch.
