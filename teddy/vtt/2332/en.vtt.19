00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:30.759
When I asked, they said yes,
the fence should go.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.046
Yes, we want to play with the other side.

00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:37.336
The pictures implied enough
to answer a question

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.007
that was never proposed.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.479
People were seeing the absurdity
of the situation again

00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:44.865
and felt how unnecessary this fence is

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:47.418
without me forcing an opinion on them.

00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:53.025
The exhibition showed the two sides
their similarities for once.

00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:55.387
That day, there was no us and them,

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.862
there was no others.

00:09:57.648 --> 00:10:00.140
The mental wall started to crumble.
