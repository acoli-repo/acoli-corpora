00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:30.671
the fall of the Berlin Wall
always felt to me

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.935
like the introduction of a new world,
a world without barriers.

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.144
But since the attacks of 9/11,

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:40.268
the construction has experienced
an extreme rise.

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:42.799
Since then, the amount has doubled,

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:46.460
with about 30 new structures
that were planned or built.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:51.628
Walls and fences are often built
with the intention of security,

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.998
security from another group of people,

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:56.336
from crime, from illegal trades.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:00.948
But walls and fences only provide us
with a feeling of security,
