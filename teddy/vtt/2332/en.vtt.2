00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:00.948
But walls and fences only provide us
with a feeling of security,

00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:03.700
which is different from real security.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.587
Even though they might make us feel safe,

00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:09.596
the structures themselves
can't protect us.

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:12.740
Instead, they do something else:

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.180
they separate.

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:16.647
They create an us and a them.

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.556
They establish an enemy.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.816
Walls make us build a second wall
in our head, a mental wall.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.567
And those mental walls
slowly make us lose sight

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:31.563
of all the things we have in common
with the people on the other side.
