00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.109
with a group of young Germans
who grew up without the wall

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:34.258
to see if these effects
are still measurable nowadays.

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:37.564
And the results show that this generation,

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:39.070
my generation,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:43.320
is just kind of bad
at geography in general --

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:44.414
(Laughter)

00:03:44.438 --> 00:03:45.632
East and West.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:49.378
But in our defense, this could be seen
as an improvement, right?

00:03:49.402 --> 00:03:51.978
We never experienced the actual wall.

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:55.842
This physical barrier was never able
to make us build a mental wall

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:57.114
in the first place.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.060
I would love to take this
as a serious indication
