Humankind loves to build walls.

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:06.146
Have you ever noticed that?

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:08.732

for shelter, for protection, for privacy.

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:15.148
Over the past 70 years,

between countries has doubled.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.407
Right now, there are more walls
than at the end of the Second World War,

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.143
more than during the Cold War.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.239

always felt to me
