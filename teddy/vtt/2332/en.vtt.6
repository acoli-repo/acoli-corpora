The interesting thing is that they found
a link between political attitude

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.884
and estimation of the distance.

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:11.342
The more a participant was against
the German reunification,

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.897
the further away
they estimated cities to be.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:20.769
It's the mental wall which keeps
cities on the other side far away,

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:23.739
and the higher and stronger
this mental wall,

00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:26.154
the more difficult
they seem to be reached.

00:03:26.777 --> 00:03:28.117
I tried to repeat this study

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.109
with a group of young Germans
who grew up without the wall
