00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:01.004
if not impossible.

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.008
And yet, somehow,

00:06:03.032 --> 00:06:06.688
I seem to be the only one having
a problem with this fence in Brussels.

00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:09.576
Most of the parents, teachers and children

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.570
stopped seeing or at least
questioning the structure.

00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:14.297
It's just how it is.

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.554

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:24.292
and he said, "No."

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.817
Then I asked if he would play with them
if the fence wasn't there,

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:29.707
and he said, "Probably."

00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:32.221
But then he quickly added
that the fence should stay,
