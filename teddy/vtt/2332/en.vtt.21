00:10:29.197 --> 00:10:33.471
telling the same story I experienced
in Brussels and Germany,

00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:36.336
enough examples from which
we could have learned.

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:42.388
But still, we seek walls as solutions
for problems that they cannot solve,

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:46.371
because walls don't fight
the root of our problem.

00:10:46.907 --> 00:10:49.662
If anything, they reduce the symptoms.

00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:53.994
So the next time you
are planning to build a wall

00:10:54.018 --> 00:10:58.199
or you are planning to support someone
who wants to build a wall,

00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:01.704
I want you to remember
the impact you are really having.
