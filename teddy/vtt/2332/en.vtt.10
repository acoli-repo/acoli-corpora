00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:00.170
Both schools teach in Dutch.

00:05:00.594 --> 00:05:03.582
But one school is mainly visited
by Belgian children,

00:05:03.606 --> 00:05:06.379
and the other school,
by immigrant children.

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:08.839
The schools are separated
by walls and fences,

00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:11.503
leaving the children
no point of interaction

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:15.295
other than this fence on the schoolyard
that separates them.

00:05:15.962 --> 00:05:17.367
When I started to work there,

00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:20.608
it made me sad to see children
having to stand at a fence

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:23.055
to talk to their friend on the other side.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.526
But what's even worse is that
most of the children

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.819
will never get the opportunity
to even make a friend on the other side.
