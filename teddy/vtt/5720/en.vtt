We don't just have a climate crisis,

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:05.996
we have a climate leadership crisis.

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:09.356
We've acted as though
an environmental crisis

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:12.076
created by corporate and government elites

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.756
can now somehow be solved

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:16.236

and government elites.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:21.436
While the people on the front lines,
the people most impacted

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:25.636

rising sea levels,

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:28.076
