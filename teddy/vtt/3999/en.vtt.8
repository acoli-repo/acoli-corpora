00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.588
and in a single jump,

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:03.492
going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.212
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:08.535
So the question is:

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.520
How do cat fleas do it?

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:14.211
It turns out, they make
this wonderful material,

00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:15.961
which is called resilin.

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:19.376
In simple words, resilin,
which is a protein,

00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:24.145
is the most elastic rubber on Earth.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.733
You can stretch it,

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:29.384
you can squish it,

00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:32.699
and it doesn't lose almost any energy
to the environment.
