They recognize each other
and self-assemble

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.529
into structures -- scaffolds
on which cells are proliferating

00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:14.993
to give tissues.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.204
They develop into organs,
and together bring life.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:25.056
So we at the Hebrew University,
about 10 years ago, decided to focus

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.058
on probably the most important
biomaterial for humans,
