Now here, I have a personal interest.

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:35.208
This is my father, Zvi,
in our winery in Israel.

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.954
A heart valve, very similar
to the one that I showed you before,

00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:42.751
seven years ago,
was implanted in his body.

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:49.077
Now, the scientific literature says
that these heart valves start to fail

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.144
10 years after the operation.

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:53.660
No wonder:

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.791
they are made from old, used tissues,

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:02.156
just like this wall made of bricks
that is falling apart.
