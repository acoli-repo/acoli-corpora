00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.273
to perfect some of the most
amazing materials,

00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:35.434
that we wish we had in our possession.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:40.902
Remember, these materials
carry a quality assurance

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:42.810
of three billion years.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.525
Take, for example, sequoia trees.

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.696
They carry hundreds of tons
for hundreds of years

00:00:50.243 --> 00:00:53.161
in cold weather, in warm climates,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.528
UV light.

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:59.125
Yet, if you look at the structure
by high-resolution electron microscopy,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.172
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,
