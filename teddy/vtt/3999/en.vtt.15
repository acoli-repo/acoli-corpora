on probably the most important
biomaterial for humans,

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:32.291
which is collagen.

00:07:33.142 --> 00:07:34.332
Why collagen?

00:07:34.356 --> 00:07:38.070

We have nothing more than collagen,
other than water, in our body.

00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.584
So I always like to say,

00:07:44.608 --> 00:07:47.703

would like to have collagen.

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.687
Admittedly, before we started our project,

00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:56.354
there were already more
than 1,000 medical implants

00:07:56.378 --> 00:07:57.780
made of collagen.

00:07:57.804 --> 00:08:01.660
You know, simple things like
dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,
