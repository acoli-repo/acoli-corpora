00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:01.673
which we glue and screw into our body.

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:04.861
And I'm going to say
that this is not a good idea.

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:06.796
Why? Because they fail.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:08.559
This synthetic material fails,

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.632
just like this plastic fork,

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:13.798
that is not strong enough
for its performance.

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.149
But sometimes they are too strong,

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:19.244
and therefore their mechanical
properties do not really fit

00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:20.758
their surrounding tissues.

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.229
But in fact, the reason
is much more fundamental.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.509
The reason is that in nature,

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:29.412
there is no one there

00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:33.092
that actually takes my head
and screws it onto my neck,
