00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:04.619
Two hundred years of modern science.

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.829
We have to admit

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:08.518
that our performance is not great.

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:12.331
The machines we build continue
to suffer from mechanical failures.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.767
The houses we build
do not survive severe earthquakes.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.764
But we shouldn't be so critical
of our scientists for a simple reason:

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:23.272
they didn't have much time.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.400
Two hundred years is not a lot of time,

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:29.647
while nature had three billion years

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.273
to perfect some of the most
amazing materials,
