00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.685
than we had before the injury.

00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:03.367
So what's for the future?

00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:06.392
In the future, we believe
we'll be able to make

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:09.993
many nanobio building blocks
that nature provided for us --

00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:13.857
collagen, nanocellulose,
resilin and many more.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.073
And that will enable us to make
better machines perform better,

00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.279
even the heart.

00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:22.097
Now, this heart
is not going to be the same

00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:24.263
as we can get from a donor.

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.286
It will be better.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:28.866
It actually will perform better

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.191
and will last longer.
