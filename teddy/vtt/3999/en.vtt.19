00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:30.783
for making type I collagen in humans

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:34.926
into a transgenic tobacco plant.

00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:41.224
So now, the plant has the ability
to make human collagen brand new,

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.404
untouched.

00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:43.661
This is amazing.

00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:46.176
Actually, it's happening now.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:52.015
Today in Israel, we grow it
in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.284
all over the country.

00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:56.517
The farmers receive
small plantlets of tobacco.

00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.491
It looks exactly like regular tobacco,

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:01.046
except that they have five human genes.
