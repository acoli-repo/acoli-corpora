00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.470
So every living cell,

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:47.128
whether coming from a plant,
insect or human being,

00:06:47.152 --> 00:06:51.235
has a DNA that encodes
for nanobio building blocks.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.808
Many times they are proteins.

00:06:53.318 --> 00:06:56.949
Other times, they are enzymes
that make other materials,

00:06:56.973 --> 00:06:59.060

00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:02.427
And the common feature
