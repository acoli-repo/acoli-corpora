00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:03.092
we have shown that by adding
only a small percent of nanocellulose

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:06.913
into cotton fibers, the same
as my shirt is made of,

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:09.786
it increases its strength dramatically.

00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:15.142
So this can be used
for making amazing things,

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.466
like super-fabrics for industrial
and medical applications.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.913
But this is not the only thing.

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:26.791
For example, self-standing,
self-supporting structures,

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.411
like the shelters that you can see now,

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:34.234
actually are now showcasing
in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.
