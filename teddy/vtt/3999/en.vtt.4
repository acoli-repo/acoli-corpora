00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.974
So we at the Hebrew University,
together with our partners in Sweden,

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:08.649
decided to focus on the development
of an industrial-scale process

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:10.347
to produce this nanocellulose.

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:13.595
And, of course,
we didn't want to cut trees.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.950
So we were looking for another source

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:18.326
of raw material,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.966
and we found one -- in fact,
the sludge of the paper industry.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:25.582
The reason: there is a lot of it.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.969
Europe alone produces 11 million tons

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.534
of that material annually.
