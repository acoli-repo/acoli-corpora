00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.172
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.968
surprisingly, it's made of sugar.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.801
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:11.736
It's actually a nanofiber
called nanocrystalline cellulose.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.725
And this nanocrystalline cellulose
is so strong, on a weight basis,

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.068
it's about 10 times stronger than steel.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:22.846
Yet it's made of sugar.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.362
So scientists all over the world
believe that nanocellulose

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:31.598
is going to be one of the most important
materials for the entire industry.
