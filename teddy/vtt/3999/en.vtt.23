00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:30.023
Together with our partners from Ireland,

00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:31.762
we thought about the next thing:

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:34.358
adding resilin to those fibers.

00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.608
By doing that,

00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:39.430
we've been able to make a superfiber

00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:42.428
which is about 380 percent tougher,

00:11:42.775 --> 00:11:45.487
and 300 percent more elastic.

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:48.591
So oddly enough, in the future,

00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:53.575
when a patient is transplanted
with artificial tendons or ligaments

00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:55.329
made from these fibers,

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:58.932
we'll have better performance
after the surgery

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.685
than we had before the injury.
