00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.534
of that material annually.

00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:37.054
It's the equivalent of a mountain
three kilometers high,

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:38.509
sitting on a soccer field.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.263
And we produce this mountain every year.

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:45.170
So for everybody,
it's an environmental problem,

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:47.470
and for us, it's a gold mine.

00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:53.085
So now, we are actually producing,
on an industrial scale in Israel,

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.660
nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:57.834
We can do a lot of things
with the material.

00:02:57.858 --> 00:02:59.233
For example,

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:03.092
we have shown that by adding
only a small percent of nanocellulose
