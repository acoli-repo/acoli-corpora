00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:02.426
Mostly, they gently
encouraged me to get help;

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.397
I never felt out of control with them --

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:06.188
an interesting parallel,

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:09.775
as I felt so out of control
in every other aspect of my life.

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:12.841
It felt my self-harm
was probably the only area

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:14.710
where I felt I had any control.

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:21.175
A few years later, I managed to get
some control in my life.

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.903
And I had appropriate support around me

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:26.045
to allow me to live
with what had happened.

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:29.144
I had become a survivor of abuse
rather than a victim.
