But I guess in a world which is dominated
by professionalizing everything we do,

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.585
I really understood
that that simple act of listening

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:04.744
could have such a life-changing effect.

00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:07.007
I guess it's a simple concept

00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:09.474
that can be applied
across all areas of life.

00:06:10.768 --> 00:06:12.800
So in the 1980s, when I called Samaritans,

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.394
child abuse was a subject
no one wanted to talk about.

00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:19.874
Victims were often blamed,
victims were often judged.

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:25.051
And it was a topic of shame,
and no one really wanted to talk about it.

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.847
Today, judgment and shame
surround a different issue.

00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.275
There's a different stigma
that's out there.
