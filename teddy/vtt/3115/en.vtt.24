00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:02.283
SA: And that's not untypical of a call
we might receive at our helpline.

00:12:02.307 --> 00:12:04.956
That's someone who really sees us
as part of the family.

00:12:05.727 --> 00:12:08.212
So Silver Line, I guess,
are now helping older people

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:10.442
in the same way
that Samaritans has helped me.

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:13.124
They're there 24/7,
they're listening confidentially

00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:15.671
and quite often not giving any advice.

00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:19.307
How often do we really ever listen
without giving advice?

00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.664
It's actually quite hard.

00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:23.697
Quite often on the phone calls,
an older person would say,

00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:25.663
"Could you give me some advice, please?"

00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:28.546
And 20 minutes later, they say,
"Thank you for your advice,"

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.310
and we realize we haven't given any.
