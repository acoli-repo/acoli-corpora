00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:32.537
And some quite simply, as I was,
may have simply just given up on life.

00:09:34.931 --> 00:09:37.685
I guess it's a really simple idea,
setting up a helpline.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:39.418
And I look back to those early days

00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:43.157
when I had the lofty title, I still have,
of chief exec, but in the early days,

00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:44.632
I was chief exec of myself.

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:48.139
Which, I have to say, I had
the best meetings ever in my career --

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:49.314
(Laughter)

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:50.624
as chief exec of myself.

00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:54.431
But things have moved on, and now in 2017,

00:09:54.455 --> 00:09:58.183
we have over 200 staff
listening to older people

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:00.074
every day of the year, 24/7.
