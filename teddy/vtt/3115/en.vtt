00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.325
After cutting her arm with a broken glass,

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:08.423
she fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep
on the railway station platform.

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.443
Early in the morning,
when the station toilets were opened,

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.640
she got painfully to her feet,
and made her way over to them.

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.537
When she saw her reflection in the mirror,

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.828
she started to cry.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.974
Her face was dirty and tearstained;

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:25.323
her shirt was ripped and covered in blood.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:30.085
She looked as if she'd been on the streets
for three months, not three days.
