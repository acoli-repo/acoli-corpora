walked out and left me in the family home.

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:05.482
And the abuse I was suffering
at the hands of my father and his friends

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.239
had left me a total wreck.

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:10.839
I was running away, I was missing school,

00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:12.196
I was arriving drunk.

00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:15.424
I was without hope and wanted to die.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:18.851
And that's where Samaritans came in.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:24.345
Samaritans has been around since 1953.

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:28.497
It's a 24/7 confidential
helpline in the UK

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.544
for anyone who might be feeling
desperate or suicidal.
