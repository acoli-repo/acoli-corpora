00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.793
The 14-year-old
that made that call was me.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.122
That was me in the phone box.

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.336
I was running away from home,
sleeping rough on the streets in London.

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:44.459
I was being sexually abused
by my father and his friends.

00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.747
I was self-harming every day.
I was suicidal.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:55.502
The first time I called Samaritans,
I was 12 and absolutely desperate.

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.027
It was a few months after
my mother had deserted me,

00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:01.252
walked out and left me in the family home.
