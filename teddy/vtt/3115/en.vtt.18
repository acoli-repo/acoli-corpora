00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:02.466
I launched a new national
helpline in the UK for older people,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.696
called The Silver Line,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.084
which is there to support
lonely and isolated older people.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.793
In our short history,
we've taken 1.5 million calls.

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:16.097
And I know we're having a big impact,
based on the feedback we get every day.

00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:20.006
Some people might be calling up
for a friendly chat,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.514
maybe some information
about local services.

00:09:22.538 --> 00:09:25.180
Some might be calling
because they're suicidal.

00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:27.998
Some might be calling up
because they're reporting abuse.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:32.537
And some quite simply, as I was,
may have simply just given up on life.
