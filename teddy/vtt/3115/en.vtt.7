00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.544
for anyone who might be feeling
desperate or suicidal.

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.503
Which I certainly was.

00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:37.592
Volunteers answer the phone
around the clock every day of the year,

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.148
and calls are confidential.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:43.744
During my teenage years,
when I was most desperate,

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.901
Samaritans became my lifeline.

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.426
They promised me total confidentiality.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.259
And that allowed me to trust them.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.506
Disturbing as they no doubt
found my story, they never showed it.

00:03:56.457 --> 00:03:59.529
They were always there for me
and listened without judgment.
