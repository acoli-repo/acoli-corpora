Pam: And what's happened
to make you so upset?

00:02:01.128 --> 00:02:05.022
Girl: I just want to die.
Every day I wake up and wish I was dead.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:08.767
If he doesn't kill me, then, I think,
I want to do it myself.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.616
Pam: I'm glad you called.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.031
Let's start at the beginning.

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.014
Sophie Andrews: Pam continued to gently
ask the girl about herself.

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:22.582
She didn't say much;
there were lots of silences.

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:24.576
But she knew she was there,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.952
and having Pam on the end of the phone
felt so comforting.
