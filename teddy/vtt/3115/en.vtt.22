donkey's years ago,

00:11:21.887 --> 00:11:24.783
if you wanted to make
a phone call to somebody,

00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:26.998
you had to go to a shop

00:11:27.022 --> 00:11:29.474
and use the telephone of the shop

00:11:29.498 --> 00:11:33.451
and pay the shop for using the telephone
and have your phone call.
