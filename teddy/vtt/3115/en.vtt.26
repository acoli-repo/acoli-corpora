(Laughter)

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:03.656
But for the first time in her life,
she had that catcher,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.355

00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:16.736
and becoming volunteers
and becoming part of our family.

And people generally ask me why.

00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:30.649
And it's because,
at every stage of my life,
