WEBVTT

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:00.074
every day of the year, 24/7.

00:10:00.673 --> 00:10:04.443
We also have over 3,000 volunteers
making weekly friendship calls

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:05.806
from their own home.

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:08.974
We also, for people
that like the written word,

00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:11.895
offer Silver Letters,
and we write pen-pal letters

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.883
to older people who still enjoy
receiving a letter.

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:18.418
And we also have introduced
something called Silver Circles --

00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:20.706
you notice I'm owning
the word "silver" here --

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.733
put "silver" in front of it and it's ours.

00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:24.714
Silver Circles are group conference calls

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:27.062
where people actually
talk about shared interests.

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:28.935
My favorite group is the music group,

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:31.312
where people, every week,
play musical instruments
