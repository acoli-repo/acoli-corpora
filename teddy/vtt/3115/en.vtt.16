and being listened to
in an empathetic way.

00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:07.006
Professionals, and I'm conscious
I'm speaking to a room of professionals,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.427
have a very important place.

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.466
But for me, a volunteer
giving up their time

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.220
and listening to me without judgment
in a confidential way,

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:17.998
had such a huge,
life-changing effect for me.

00:08:18.546 --> 00:08:21.013
And that was something
that really stayed with me.

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.935
So as you will have gathered,
in my teenage years,

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:27.874
I was off the rails, I was going every day
wondering if I'd even live the next day.

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:31.808
But that profound impact of the volunteer
listening to me stayed with me.
