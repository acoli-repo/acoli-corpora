00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.310
and we realize we haven't given any.

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:31.335
(Laughter)

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.972
We've listened and listened,
and we haven't interrupted.

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:36.487
But to that person,
maybe we have given advice.

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:38.877
We recently conducted
a survey at The Silver Line

00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:42.558
to 3,000 older people, to ask them
what they thought of the service.

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:44.916
And one person quite simply
came back and said,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.497
for the first time in her life,

00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:51.307
she had what we would call
in the sport cricket a wicketkeeper,

00:12:51.331 --> 00:12:54.531
and what you would call
in baseball, a catcher.

00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.308
I've been here 48 hours,
and I'm talking American.

00:12:57.332 --> 00:12:59.347
They will not recognize me
when I get home.

00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:00.895
(Laughter)
