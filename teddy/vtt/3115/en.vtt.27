00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:30.649
And it's because,
at every stage of my life,

00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:35.110
I have been lucky enough to have someone
alongside me at the right time

00:13:35.134 --> 00:13:36.897
who maybe has believed in me,

00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:38.278
which in turn has helped me

00:13:38.302 --> 00:13:42.124
just to believe a little bit more
in myself, which has been so important.

00:13:43.094 --> 00:13:45.894
And everyone needs a catcher
at some point in their lives.

00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:48.162
This is my catcher.

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:50.014
So that's Pam.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.622
And she answered the call to me

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:55.218
when I was that 14-year-old
in the phone box, over 30 years ago.

00:13:56.973 --> 00:14:01.441
So never, ever underestimate
the power of a simple human connection.
