00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:32.323
But being a caregiver for a partner
that maybe has dementia

00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:34.080
can be a very lonely place.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.291
And a recent landmark study gave us
a very good, clear definition

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:39.830
of what loneliness is.

00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:43.256
And it said it's a subjective,
unwelcome feeling

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.614
of a lack or loss of companionship.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:48.249
And it happens when there's a mismatch

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:51.939
between the quality and the quantity
of relationships that we have

00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:53.310
and those that we want.

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.746
Now in my life, the best help
I've ever received

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.920
has been from those personal connections

00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:02.475
and being listened to
in an empathetic way.
