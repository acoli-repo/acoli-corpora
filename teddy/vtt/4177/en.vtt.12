Maybe their answers will be the hope
that supports you, improves you and enhances you.

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:07.927
And if nothing else it can transform
into poetry, like it does for me.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.237
Having played the game
of life through the ages,

00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:12.047
Having jostled the good and bad,

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.687
having drowned and resurfaced,

00:06:13.711 --> 00:06:15.647
having won and lost,

00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:19.327
in a moment of rest when
the heart took a breath,

00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:21.567
it came face to face with life's truths.

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.327
It accepted that life sometimes
tickles us with joy,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:28.007
or sometimes it tugs at us with sorrow.

00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:30.487
Life teaches us so much.
