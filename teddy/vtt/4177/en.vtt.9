00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:30.887
we adopted a village.

00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.247
This 600-year-old village called Saur

00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:37.127
boasted of a population
of over 200 families in 2011,

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.607
but today only 12 families
remain due to migration.

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:45.807
On these ruins, we painted
their life-lessons and folktales.

00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:49.207
Now, Saur has become the first
village in the world

00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:54.271
where an entire society’s life-lessons can
be seen and read outside their homes.

00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:03.287
This village, which was known
as the ghost village up until June 1, 2017,
