Deepak Ramola: My mother
was only able to study until Class 5.

00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:37.447
Her grandmother did not want any girl
from the family to go to school.

00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:42.807
Mother often told us to study well,
since she never had the pleasure of books.

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.567
One day, I got angry and told her

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:47.127
she was lying about never
having been to school.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.532
Without understanding mathematics,
how do you manage household finances?

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:53.881
Without understanding literature,
how do you guide us through life?

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.131
My mother smiled and said,
"It’s true I never went to school,

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.308
but I learn with close attention to 
whatever the life teaches me."
