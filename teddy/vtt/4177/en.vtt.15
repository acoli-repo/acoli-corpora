00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:30.007
First, treat others as you
want to be treated by them,

00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:31.567
I think that's very important.

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:35.807
And second, which is quite an important one:
spend some time with yourself.

00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:39.687
Especially when you
are low or face a failure.

00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.007
Because you will find a lot more
failures than success in life.

00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:44.727
At that time, listen to everyone,

00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.901
learn from those who love you,
who pamper you, who get angry with you.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.247
Listen to the advice of all.

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:54.207
But once a day I try for at least 
an hour and half to two hours,

00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:56.946
sit quietly by yourself.
Atleast that's what I try to do.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.687
Some people may call it meditation,

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.567
or introspection.
