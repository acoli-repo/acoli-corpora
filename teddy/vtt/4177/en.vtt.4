I mean to say that I was convinced
that in every individual's experience,

00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:14.167
there is a solution to some or
the other problem in the world.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:20.447

Today, the world's population
is over seven billion.

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:28.967

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:34.687
Seven billion life lessons that you
can use to face any problem you encounter.
