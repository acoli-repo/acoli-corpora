Believe me, since seventeen years of age,
teaching people twice my age

00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:34.345
had been a wonderful journey, 
but difficult as well.

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:37.687
Even then I continued trying it ,
because I believe

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.407
that along with the intelligentsia,

00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:44.727
if we also understand the knowledge
of the ordinary, illiterate people

00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:48.447
we can find solutions
to even our biggest problems easily.

00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:52.167
So today when you sit
with your family, your friends

00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:55.887
ask them what life has taught them.

00:05:55.911 --> 00:06:01.807
Maybe their answers will be the hope
that supports you, improves you and enhances you.
