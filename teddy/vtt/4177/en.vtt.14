SRK: Thank you, so much Deepak.

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:06.407
You're so young you could be
attending school lessons,

00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:08.596
but here you are, giving life lessons.
How old are you?

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.528
DR: Twenty-five.

00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:15.387
SRK: At 25 you have shared with us
and taught us such brilliant things today.

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:18.811
DR: I really want to know,
and the audience I’m sure agrees:

00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.421
What have you learned from life?
Your life lesson?

00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.001
(Cheers and applause)

00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.167
SRK: There are only two lessons
I've learned in life.

00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:30.007
First, treat others as you
want to be treated by them,
