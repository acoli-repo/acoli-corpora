where we can change someone’s
life without ever meeting them.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:04.647
Once, while travelling on the Delhi
Metro, I asked a lady,

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.007
"What has life taught you?"

00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.767
The reply I got was "If every morning,
your face in the mirror can surprise you,

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.471
you are leading a good life."

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.807
I converted this life lesson
into an activity using 300 mirrors.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:22.791
I asked my students in a class 
in Punjab to jot down

00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:25.791
40 new things in their faces 
in just four minutes.

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.287
Someone counted her eyelashes,
another her moles,

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:33.527
and one girl fell in love
with her smile for the first time.
