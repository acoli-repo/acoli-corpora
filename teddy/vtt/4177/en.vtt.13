00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:30.487
Life teaches us so much.

00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:33.967
Lonely, still nights held
days of hope within them.

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:37.127
Someone your own, someone unknown
who walks two steps with you.

00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.487
Sometimes lost in the crowd,
sometimes celebrating the solitude.

00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:42.727
It’s the mind that calms the mind.

00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:45.527
Sometimes it takes you
to your destination in moments.

00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:48.327
Sometimes it repeats the
same bend a hundred times.

00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.647
This is life.

00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.551
And life teaches you a lot of things.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.639

00:06:59.911 --> 00:07:02.207
