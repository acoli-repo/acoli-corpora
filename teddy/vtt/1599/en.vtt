00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one, the rise of a culture of availability;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and two, a request.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we're seeing a rise of this availability

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
being driven by mobile device proliferation,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
globally, across all social strata.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
an expectation of availability.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And, with that, comes the third point,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the problem is, we're still working through,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
from a societal standpoint,
