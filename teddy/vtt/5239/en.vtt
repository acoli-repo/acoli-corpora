Many generations have felt
they've reached the pinnacle

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:11.121
of technological advancement;

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:12.746
yet look back 100 years,

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.163
and the technologies
we take for granted today

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:18.079
would seem like impossible magic.

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:21.788
So will there be a point

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.038
where we reach an actual limit
of technological progress?

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.954
And if so, are we anywhere near
that limit now?
