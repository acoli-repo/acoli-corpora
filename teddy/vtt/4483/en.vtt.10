00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and the suppliers from the North.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Now, these suppliers

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
were our big companies.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They were the actors of this global market,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which I mentioned in the beginning.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They were the Siemenses of this world,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
from Canada, from Germany,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and they were systematically driven

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
by systematic, large-scale corruption.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We are not talking about

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
50,000 dollars here,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
