00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
donor meetings, for instance,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in which the various donors,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it is true, it is one of the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
unsafest cities of the world,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but they like to be there because the other cities

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
are even less comfortable.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And in these donor meetings, I noticed

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that many of the worst projects --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
which were put forward

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
by our clients, by the governments,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
by promoters,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
many of them representing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
suppliers from the North --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that the worst projects

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
were realized first.
