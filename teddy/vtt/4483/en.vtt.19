00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and to make a long story short,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
we managed to eventually

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
get Germany to sign

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
together with the other OECD countries

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and a few other exporters.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
In 1997, a convention,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
under the auspices of the OECD,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which obliged everybody

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to change their laws

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and criminalize foreign bribery.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in doing this,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we had to sit together with the companies.
