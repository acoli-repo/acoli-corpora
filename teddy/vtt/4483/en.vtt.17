00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
have this dilemma.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Many of them didn't want to bribe.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Many of the German companies, for instance,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
believe that they are really

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
producing a high-quality product

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
at a good price, so they are very competitive.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They are not as good at bribing

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
as many of their international competitors are,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but they were not allowed

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to show their strengths,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
because the world was eaten up

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
by grand corruption.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And this is why I'm telling you this:

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Civil society rose to the occasion.
