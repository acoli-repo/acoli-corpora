00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that the worst projects

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
were realized first.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me give you an example:

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a huge power project,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
300 million dollars,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to be built smack into

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
areas of western Kenya.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And we all noticed immediately

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that this project had no economic benefits:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
nobody was interested in irrigation projects.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
To the contrary, we knew that this project
