00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
To the contrary, we knew that this project

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
would destroy the environment:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It would destroy riparian forests,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which were the basis for

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the survival of nomadic groups,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
for these hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and the siphoning off

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of the scarce resources of the economy

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
from much more important activities
