00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
with non-governmental organizations.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And in the first session, they all said,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This is what these other cultures demand.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
They even applaud it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
In fact, [unclear]

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
still says this today.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And so there are still a lot of people

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But in the second session,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
they admitted already that they would never do this,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
what they are doing in these other countries,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Cabinet ministers would admit this.
