00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I believe that what we managed to achieve

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
in fighting corruption,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
one can also achieve

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in other areas of failing governance.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
By now, the United Nations

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
is totally on our side.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
they became, I would say, the strongest

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
anti-corruption agency in the world.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Most of the large companies

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are now totally convinced

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that they have to put in place

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
very strong policies

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
against bribery and so on.
