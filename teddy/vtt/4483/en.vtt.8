00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of the scarce resources of the economy

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
from much more important activities

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
like schools, like hospitals and so on.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And yet, we all rejected this project,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
none of the donors was willing

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to have their name connected with it,

they took years, you know,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000

and very often they didn't succeed.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But these bad projects,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
for many generations, for the environment,
