Not all civil society organizations are good.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So, we must be aware

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that civil society

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
has to shape up itself.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
They have to have a much more

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
transparent financial governance.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They have to have a much more participatory governance

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
in many civil society organizations.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
because we believe most of our educational

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and research institutions in Germany
