WEBVTT

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
an individual exporting country

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to say, "We are not going to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
continue this deadly, disastrous

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
habit of large companies to bribe."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So this is what I mean

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
with a failing governance structure,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
because even the powerful government,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which we have in Germany, comparatively,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
was not able to say,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They needed help,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the large companies themselves

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
have this dilemma.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Many of them didn't want to bribe.
