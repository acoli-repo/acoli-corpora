00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:30.533
And that is why, when you walk
into a Walgreens in New York,

00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:32.661
you cannot check the source
of your medicine,

00:08:32.685 --> 00:08:34.846

problem-solving models.

00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:59.665
Now, you might say, "Well, that's bad,

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:03.979
but in such a world
where we have so many other problems,
