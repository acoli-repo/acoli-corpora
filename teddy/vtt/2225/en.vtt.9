you are giving them a lifetime insurance

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.530

that can cripple them or kill them.

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:36.459
Sometimes, this is for a lifetime.

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:41.564
The problem is that vaccines
are delicate organisms really,

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:44.751
and they need to be stored
between two degrees and eight degrees.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.577
And if you don't do that,

00:04:53.704 --> 00:04:56.441
Working with computer vision scientists,

00:04:56.465 --> 00:05:01.067
we've converted simple markers
on the vials of vaccines
