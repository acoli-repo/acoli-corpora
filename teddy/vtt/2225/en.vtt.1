But let's be blunt about it:

00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:34.040

what we really mean is the poor world --

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:37.987

with ready-made containers

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:42.268
for the hand-me-down ideas
of other places and other people.

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:48.884
But I'm here to depart
a little bit from the script

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:51.158
and to try and convince you

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.395
that these places are actually
alive and bubbling with ideas.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.639

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.467
