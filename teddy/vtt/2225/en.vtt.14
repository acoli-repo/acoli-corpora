00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:02.391
is a fundamental issue
of the breakdown of trust

00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:04.090
in markets and institutions,

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:07.571
and that there's nothing more global,
more universal, closer to you and I

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:08.917
than the problem of trust.

00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:15.940
For example, a quarter of all the seafood
marketed in the US is falsely labeled.

00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:18.579
So when you buy a tuna
or salmon sandwich in Manhattan,

00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:22.016
you are eating something that could be
banned for being toxic in Japan.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.936
Literally.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.654
Most of you have heard of a time
when horsemeat was masquerading as beef

00:07:28.678 --> 00:07:30.242
in burger patties in Europe?
