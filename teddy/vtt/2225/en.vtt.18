00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:03.979
but in such a world
where we have so many other problems,

00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:05.533
do we need another cause?"

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:07.184
I say yes, we need another cause.

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:10.706
Actually, that cause will surprise you:
the cause of intellectual justice.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.206
You say, "What? Intellectual justice?
In a world of human rights abuses?"

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.593
And I explain this way:

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:19.943
all the solutions to the other problems
that affect us and confront us

00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:21.140
need solutions.

00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:23.414
So you need the best ideas
to address them.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.434
And that is why today I ask you,

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:28.760
can we all give it one time
for intellectual justice?
