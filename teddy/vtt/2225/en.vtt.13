00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:31.514
And that is that there are
parts of the world

00:06:31.538 --> 00:06:34.337
whose good ideas simply don't scale

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.629
because of the latitude
on which they were born.

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:39.256
I call that "mental latitude imperialism."

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280
(Laughter)

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:43.441
That really is the reason.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.689
But you may counter and say, "Well,
maybe it's an important problem,

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:49.452
but it's sort of an obscure problem
in parts of the world.

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:51.534
Why do you want
to globalize such problems?

00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:53.070
I mean, they are better local."

00:06:53.094 --> 00:06:54.664
What if, in response, I told you

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:59.921
that actually, underlying each
of these problems that I've described

00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:02.391
is a fundamental issue
of the breakdown of trust
