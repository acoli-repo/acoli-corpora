00:04:56.465 --> 00:05:01.067
we've converted simple markers
on the vials of vaccines

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.535
into what you might regard
as crude thermometers.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.769
So then, these patterns change slowly
over time in response to temperature

00:05:07.793 --> 00:05:11.475
until they leave a distinct pattern
on the surface of the vaccine,

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.928
such that a nurse,
with a scan of the phone,

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:19.111
can detect if the vaccine was stored
properly in the right temperature

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:21.124
and therefore is still good for use

00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:23.360
before administering this to the child --

00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:27.183
literally securing the next generation.

00:05:27.207 --> 00:05:33.082
These are some of the solutions at work
saving lives, redeeming societies,
