In 1965, 17-year-old high school student,
Randy Gardner

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:16.042
stayed awake for 264 hours.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:20.060
That's 11 days to see how
he'd cope without sleep.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.241
On the second day, 
his eyes stopped focusing.

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.350
Next, he lost the ability
to identify objects by touch.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.917
By day three, Gardner was moody
and uncoordinated.
