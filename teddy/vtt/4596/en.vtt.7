00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:33.938
So, what's happening in our brain
when we sleep to prevent this?

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:37.246
Scientists found something called
the glymphatic system,

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:40.355
a clean-up mechanism 
that removes this buildup

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:43.219
and is much more active when we're asleep.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.645
It works by using cerebrospinal fluid
to flush away toxic byproducts

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.997
that accumulate between cells.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.970
Lymphatic vessels, 
which serve as pathways for immune cells,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.866
have recently been discovered 
in the brain,

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:03.951
and they may also play a role in clearing
out the brain's daily waste products.
