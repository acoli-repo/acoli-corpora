00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.063
sleeplessness is a daily reality.

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:34.136
This condition, 
known as Fatal Familial Insomnia,

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:37.609
places the body in a nightmarish 
state of wakefulness,

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.915
forbidding it from entering 
the sanctuary of sleep.

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:42.746
Within months or years,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:47.494
this progressively worsening condition
leads to dementia and death.

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:51.325
How can sleep deprivation
cause such immense suffering?

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:55.308
Scientists think the answer lies
with the accumulation of waste prducts

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.915
in the brain.

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.482
During our waking hours,

00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:01.724
our cells are busy using up
our day's energy sources,
