00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.917
By day three, Gardner was moody
and uncoordinated.

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.806
At the end of the experiment,
he was struggling to concentrate,

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:35.607
had trouble with short-term memory,

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:37.107
became paranoid,

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:39.011
and started hallucinating.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.741
Although Gardner recovered without
long-term psychological

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.409
or physical damage,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.100
for others, losing shuteye can result
in hormonal imbalance,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.192
illness,

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:50.601
and, in extreme cases, death.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:55.027
We're only beginning to understand
why we sleep to begin with,

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:56.965
but we do know it's essential.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.916
Adults need seven to eight hours
of sleep a night,

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.170
and adolescents need about ten.
