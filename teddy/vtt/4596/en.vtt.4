00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:08.091
after staying awake for 48 hours 
to watch the World Cup.

00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:10.822
While his untimely death 
was due to a stroke,

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:14.614
studies show that chronically sleeping
fewer than six hours a night

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.598
increases stroke risk 
by four and half times

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:22.936
compared to those getting a consistent
