00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.481
and our bodies replenish themselves
for the day ahead.

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.061
In the United States,

00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:36.681
it's estimated that 30% of adults
and 66% of adolescents

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.124
are regularly sleep-deprived.

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:41.503
This isn't just a minor inconvenience.

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:44.841
Staying awake can cause 
serious bodily harm.

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.159
When we lose sleep,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.004
learning,

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:47.828
memory,

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:48.538
mood,

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.783
and reaction time are affected.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:53.385
Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation,

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:54.607
halluciations,

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:55.957
high blood pressure,

00:01:55.957 --> 00:02:00.424
and it's even been linked
to diabetes and obesity.
