00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.170
and adolescents need about ten.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.679
We grow sleepy due to signals
from our body

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:06.986
telling our brain we are tired,

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:10.512
and signals from the environment
telling us it's dark outside.

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:12.881
The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals,

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:15.136
like adenosine and melatonin,

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:18.348
send us into a light doze 
that grows deeper,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.951
making our breathing 
and heart rate slow down

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.577
and our muscles relax.

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:27.075
This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.481
and our bodies replenish themselves
for the day ahead.
