00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:01.724
our cells are busy using up
our day's energy sources,

00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:04.385
which get broken down 
into various byproducts,

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.673
including adenosine.

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:08.457
As adenosine builds up,

00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:12.913
it increases the urge to sleep,
also known as sleep pressure.

00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:18.273
In fact, caffeine works by blocking
adenosine's receptor pathways.

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:20.969
Other waste products 
also build up in the brain,

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.986
and if they're not cleared away,
they collectively overload the brain

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:29.536
and are thought to lead to the many
negative symptoms of sleep deprivation.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:33.938
So, what's happening in our brain
when we sleep to prevent this?
