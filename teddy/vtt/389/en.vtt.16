00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:01.352
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,

00:08:01.352 --> 00:08:03.825
growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,

00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.552
the most migrant community in America.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.640
When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.001
it's no wonder we get fruit like that.

00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:11.992
And I love it! And so do they.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.907
And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.

00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:17.280
And that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.657
And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people

00:08:20.657 --> 00:08:23.075
without a food stamp or a fingerprint.

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:25.128
The poorest congressional district in America,

00:08:25.128 --> 00:08:28.312
the most migratory community in America, we can do this.

00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:32.016
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,
