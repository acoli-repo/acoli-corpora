00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:30.423
for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:32.767
And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.607
Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.622
out of work looking to manage a million dollars.

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:40.031
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.042
or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:44.495
for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.

00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:46.274
That's the beauty of this economy.

00:04:46.274 --> 00:04:49.608
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:52.584
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.993
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:58.375
And this is the true triple bottom line,

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.630
because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute
