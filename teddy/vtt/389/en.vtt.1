00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.907
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.

00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:33.049
And as jobs continue to leave my community,

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.992
and energy continues to come in, be exported in,

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:41.327
it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:43.927
But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.560
so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.896
that I'm hoping to share with you all today.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:52.373
And with that note, I come to you with this belief

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:54.847
that kids should not have to leave their communities

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:56.228
to live, learn and earn in a better one.

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:57.866
So I'm here to tell you a story about me

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:01.387
and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.
