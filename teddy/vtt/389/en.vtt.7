00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.246
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:32.983
and they invited us to the Hamptons.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:35.254
So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:37.759
And we started putting in roofs that look like this,

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.047
and we came in from destitute neighborhoods

00:03:40.047 --> 00:03:43.615
to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.609
And so we got invited back this past summer,

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.368
and we actually moved into the Hamptons,

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:50.191
payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:52.967
And when you can do stuff like this --

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:56.183
These are my kids putting in this technology,

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:58.720
and when you can build a roof that looks like that

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.134
on a house that looks like that
