00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.941
We're also becoming children of the corn,

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:33.545
creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness

00:09:33.545 --> 00:09:35.098
and window bottles out of garbage.

00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:36.897
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:40.258
but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.

00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:42.745
I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:45.129
So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:48.929
Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.

00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:51.008
Or more importantly, to local shelters,

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:53.361
where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.049
And we're stepping it up.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:57.611
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.

00:09:57.611 --> 00:10:00.890
And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.
