00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:00.020
my school and my kids were awarded the first ever

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.707
high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.

00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:05.833
The greenest class in New York City.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.275
But more importantly is my kids learned to get,

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.908
they learned to give.

00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:12.377
And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,

00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:13.825
and started buying gifts for the homeless

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:15.265
and for needy around the world.

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.675
So we started giving back.

00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:19.174
And that's when I realized that the greening of America

00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:22.409
starts first with the pockets, then with the heart

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.627
and then with the mind.

00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:25.958
So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.792
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.025
because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.
