00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.150
But this is not a Getty image.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.726
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.941
addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,

00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:37.488
making them feel a part of it.

00:05:37.488 --> 00:05:39.842
That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,

00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:42.442
coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.160
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.342
and the State Senator comes to our class,

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:50.086
believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:51.608
We are poised, ready, willing and able

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.808
to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.

00:05:54.808 --> 00:05:56.874
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public

00:05:56.874 --> 00:06:00.087
and says he's got to lose weight, so do I!
