Big kids love strawberries and bananas.

00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:04.594
Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.

00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:07.826
Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.745
But most importantly, just love them.

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:12.059
Nothing works like unconditional love.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.266
So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:17.950
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.975
35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:23.626
where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:28.013
Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.276
we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
