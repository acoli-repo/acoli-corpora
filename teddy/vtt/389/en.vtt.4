00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.931
And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.059
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.427
into something small, like this,

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.219
and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.941
kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.241
and everyone could have access.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.374
So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:18.035
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:21.383
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:23.090
private-based learning.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.714
And lo and behold, we gave birth to

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.962
the first edible wall in New York City.

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:29.122
So if you're hungry, get up and eat.

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.946
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.
