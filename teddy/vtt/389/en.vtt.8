00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.134
on a house that looks like that

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.944
with sedum that looks like this,

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.686
this is the new green graffiti.

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:10.191
So, you may wonder what does a wall like this

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.751
really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.647
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:16.967
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:19.119
Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:21.852
And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:25.341
Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:28.225
really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:30.423
for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.
