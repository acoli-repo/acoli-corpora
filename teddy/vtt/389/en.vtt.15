00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.025
because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.

00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:32.832
We're 3,000 strong right now.

00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:34.153
And what does it really do?

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.187
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:39.233

00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:52.544
Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.

00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:54.264

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:57.674
Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,

00:07:57.674 --> 00:07:59.305
something you can aspire to.

00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:01.352
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,
