00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.946
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:34.298
Okay? But we were just getting started,

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:35.667
the kids loved the technology,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.012
so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.867
Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:43.644
which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:45.650
We decided to go to Boston.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.076
And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:51.341
became the first to install a green wall,

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.626
designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.175
21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it,

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.234
it's on top of the John Hancock building.

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:00.026
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools
