00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:31.154
And it starts with incredible kids like this,

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:32.875
who come early and stay late.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.843
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:37.602
most come with a lot of handicaps,

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:40.155
most are homeless and many are in foster care.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:42.406
Almost all of my kids live below poverty.

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:45.827
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:48.018
and this is what it looks like in my classroom.

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:50.619
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.058
And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:59.275
But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.931
And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.
