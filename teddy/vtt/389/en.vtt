00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:01.747
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:04.690
I am not a farmer.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.625
(Laughter)

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.177
I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:10.739
And this is my world.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.352
And along the way I've started noticing --

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:13.821
I'm on my third generation of kids --

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.074
that they're getting bigger.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:16.233
They're getting sicker.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.217
In addition to these complexities,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.130
I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.140
who are labeled learning disabled would not have been

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.497
had they had proper prenatal nutrition.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:28.173
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.907
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.
