But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:33.529
It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.722
You have things like coral.

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:39.256

You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit

And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.850
a lot of the sand is made of biological material

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.847
because the reefs provide a place where all these

00:05:56.847 --> 00:06:00.737
microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,
