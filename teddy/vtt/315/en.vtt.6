00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.128
the whole micro world that we see,

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.161
there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.556
the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.014
But I want to talk about this larger world,

00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:12.351
the world of the micro world.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:16.470
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.621
what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?

00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:22.136
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:25.430
when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.262
and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface

00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:31.328
of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
