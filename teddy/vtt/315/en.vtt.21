00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.760
goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.304
are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:36.689
they fall down back to the surface of the Moon,

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:39.585
they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:41.130
And these are actually microscopic;

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.098
you need a microscope to see these.

00:10:44.098 --> 00:10:47.535
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,

00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:49.689
and you can see that the entire

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:52.172
crystal structure is still there.

00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:54.320
This grain of sand is probably about

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.602
three and a half or four billion years old,

00:10:56.602 --> 00:10:58.793
and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand

00:10:58.793 --> 00:11:02.812
on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,
