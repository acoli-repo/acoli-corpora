00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.509
and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.099
That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.900
and these cells, the mission is

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.427
to move blood around our body.

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:13.211
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:16.147
as we see and understand what we're looking at,

00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:18.261
our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.803
right now. They're not just static. They're moving around

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:24.305
making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.095
As you go farther down this scale here,

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:29.999
that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.347
all the way down to here to a nanometer
