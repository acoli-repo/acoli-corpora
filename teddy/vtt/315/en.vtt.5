00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.347
all the way down to here to a nanometer

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:35.104
and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.471
of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.104
That's how small that is.

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:42.406
And microscopes that we have today can actually see

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.479
individual atoms. So these are some pictures

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.312
of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:51.141
This is a ring of cobalt atoms.

00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.799
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.994
is called the nano world, and the nano world,

00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.128
the whole micro world that we see,
