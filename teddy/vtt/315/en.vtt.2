00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.172
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.

00:01:01.172 --> 00:01:03.906
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:05.082
And as we go smaller again,

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:08.488
about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:11.071
So you could fit 10 human cells

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.737
across the diameter of a human hair.

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:16.323
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:19.591
involved in biology and science is by looking

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.058
at living cells in the microscope.

00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:24.129
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:28.028
absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.

00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:31.344
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,
