00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:31.344
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:33.168
they're actually moving all over the place.

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:36.933
This cell is looking for foreign objects,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.290
bacteria, things that it can find.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.938
And it's looking around, and when it finds something,

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:44.234
and recognizes it being foreign,

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:45.526
it will actually engulf it and eat it.

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:49.810
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.432
and it engulfs it and eats it.

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:58.613
If you take some heart cells from an animal,

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.509
and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.
