called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give

00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:04.178
a fragrance, and plants actually communicate

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:09.572
with one another through their fragrances.

00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:11.940
I want to talk about something really ordinary,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.864
just ordinary sand.

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:15.794
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:18.355
when I first saw sand from Maui,

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:21.502
and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:24.533
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.444
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:30.027
But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.
