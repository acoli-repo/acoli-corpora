00:05:56.847 --> 00:06:00.737
microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,

00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:03.075
and when they die, their shells and their teeth

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:05.417
and their bones break up and they make grains of sand,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:08.387
things like coral and so forth.

00:06:08.387 --> 00:06:12.180
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.717
This is from Lahaina,

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:16.447
and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually

00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:19.901
walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:22.368
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record

00:06:22.368 --> 00:06:24.941
of that entire ecology.

00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:28.099
So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.685
two bits of coral here,
