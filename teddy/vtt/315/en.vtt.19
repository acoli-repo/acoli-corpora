00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:31.970
it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.360
and when micrometeorites come in at about

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.370
20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.280
And you can see here that that is --

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.874
that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.420
little clump of little sand grains together.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.599
This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.759
And that's called a ring agglutinate.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:53.703
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:57.160
and you'd never find that on Earth.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.413
Most of the sand on the Moon,
