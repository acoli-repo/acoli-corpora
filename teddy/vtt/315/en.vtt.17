of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:34.457
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:37.424
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.

00:08:37.424 --> 00:08:41.207
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.

00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:43.870
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.336
in a microscope you can see very little at one time,

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:49.283
so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,

00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:53.074
keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.548
that puts all those pictures together

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:58.670
into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.905
and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,
