00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:31.328
of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.704
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:36.385
is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look

00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:39.729
a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.474
this is the style of that flower, and you notice

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:46.699
that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.441
that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.058
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:55.884
it's in a little Willy Wonka land.

00:03:55.884 --> 00:04:00.019
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
