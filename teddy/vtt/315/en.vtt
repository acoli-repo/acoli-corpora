00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:04.264
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:06.990
from a totally unique point of view,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.015
and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.595
I've found, after doing this for many, many years,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.311
that there's a magical world behind reality.

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.470
And that can be seen directly through a microscope,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.575
and I'm going to show you some of this today.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:24.262
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:26.526
something that we can see with our naked eye,

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.967
and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.863
it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
