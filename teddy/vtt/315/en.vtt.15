So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:42.686
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains

of sand alike in the world.

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:47.918
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:01.331
is filled with sand, and that sand comes together
