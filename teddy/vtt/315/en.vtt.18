00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.905
and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:04.607
is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.160
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.528
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.906
than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:15.706
seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:18.664
Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused

00:09:18.664 --> 00:09:21.003
by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.

00:09:21.003 --> 00:09:23.360
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.576
come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:29.176
is covered with powder now, because for four billion years

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:31.970
it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,
