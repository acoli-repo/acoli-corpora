WEBVTT

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:01.331
is filled with sand, and that sand comes together

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.528
to make our planets and the Moon.

00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:06.110
And you can see those in micrometeorites.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.653
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,

00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:11.747
and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:14.493
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:18.917
tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in --

00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:20.832
the planets and the Moon.

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:24.076
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,

00:08:24.076 --> 00:08:26.339
so they sent me sand from all the different landings

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.817
of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.
