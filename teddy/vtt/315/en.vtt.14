So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water

and rain and ice and so forth,

00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:03.803

There's some sand that's really much more colorful.

00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:08.322
These are sand from near the Great Lakes,

There are places in Africa where they do the mining

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:31.165
of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have
