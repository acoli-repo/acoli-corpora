I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,

00:11:32.242 --> 00:11:34.784
"To see a world in a grain of sand

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:37.538
and a heaven in a wild flower,

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.871
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,

00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:42.204
and eternity in an hour."

00:11:42.204 --> 00:11:45.933
Thank you. (Applause)
