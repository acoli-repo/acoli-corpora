It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.922
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:07.368
there and there, and here is a --

00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:09.946
what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.910
when you look in a microscope, it's actually made

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.674
of thousands of little grains of pollen.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:17.909
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.714
these little plants, and they're collecting pollen,

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:23.137
those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.570
into their legs and they take it back to the hive,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.200
and that's what makes the beehive,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.018
the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,
