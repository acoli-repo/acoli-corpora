00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.863
it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:34.151
But to really see the details of the bee, and really

00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.880
appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.966
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.313
and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:46.144
thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:48.576
and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.945
so they know when they're right up close to something,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.649
because they can't see in stereo.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.353
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.172
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
