00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:03.135
I'm going to start
by telling you about an email

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.968
that I saw in my inbox recently.

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:08.167
Now, I have a pretty unusual inbox

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:09.627
because I'm a therapist

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.095
and I write an advice column
called "Dear Therapist,"

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.563
so you can imagine what's in there.

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:19.818
I mean, I've read thousands
of very personal letters

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:22.108
from strangers all over the world.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.848
And these letters range
from heartbreak and loss,

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:27.222
to spats with parents or siblings.

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:29.647
I keep them in a folder on my laptop,

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.404
and I've named it
"The Problems of Living."
