00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:04.292
There are few things we know
about mass incarceration in our country.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.421
We know, for example,
that we're the world's leading jailer.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.548
With five percent
of the world's population,

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:12.592
we incarcerate 20 percent
of its prisoners.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.596
And we know that we punish
our poor, our own.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.473
Half of the [imprisoned] --

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:21.350
in fact, well over half --
live below the poverty line.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.935
This is nothing to say

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.565
about the egregious racial disparities
in how we administer justice

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:29.650
and how we choose to punish.
