To be compassionate is not a joke.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It's not that simple.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
That bigness should be centered on oneself,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
not in terms of money,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
not in terms of power you wield,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but it should be centered on oneself.
