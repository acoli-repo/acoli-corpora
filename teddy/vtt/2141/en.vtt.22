that the wholeness cannot be different from you,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
cannot be minus you.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It has got to be you.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You cannot be a part of wholeness

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and still be whole.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that realization, that recognition:

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
"Maybe I am the whole.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Maybe the swami is right.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
