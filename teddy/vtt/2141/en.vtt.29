You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
You learn cooking by cooking,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
having some sympathetic people around you

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to eat what you cook.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(Laughter)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And, therefore, what I say,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
you have to fake it and make it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Laughter)
