00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.268
we align them perfectly,
later in a supercomputer.

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:35.893
And we recreate
kind of an Earth-sized lens.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:38.893
And the only way to do that
is to bring the data back by plane.

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:42.601
You can't beat the bandwidth
of a 747 filled with hard discs.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:43.643
(Laughter)

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.143
CA: And so, I guess a few weeks
or a few months ago,

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.809
on a computer screen somewhere,

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:51.101
this started to come into view.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.393
This moment.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.684
SD: Well, it took a long time.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.000
CA: I mean, look at this.

00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.101
That was it.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.393
That was the first image.
