00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:00.018
then there's a point at which
light orbits the black hole.

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.559
CA: And so that's, I guess,
is what's happening here.

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:03.893
This is not an image,

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:06.893
this is a computer simulation
of what we always thought,

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:09.893
like, the event horizon
around the black hole.

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:13.393
SD: Until last week, we had no idea
what a black hole really looked like.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:17.351
The best we could do were simulations
like this in supercomputers,

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.351
but even here you see this ring of light,

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.309
which is the orbit of photons.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.059
That's where photons
literally move around the black hole,

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.643
and around that is this hot gas
that's drawn to the black hole,

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.643
and it's hot because of friction.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:33.018
All this gas is trying to get
into a very small volume, so it heats up.
