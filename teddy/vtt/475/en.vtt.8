00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.768
So this was all shipped,
you couldn't send this over the internet.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:03.643
All this data was shipped to one place

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.976
and the massive computer effort began
to try and analyze it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.768
And you didn't really know

00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:10.976
what you were going to see
coming out of this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.268
SD: The way this technique
works that we used --

00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:16.642
imagine taking an optical mirror
and smashing it

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.892
and putting all the shards
in different places.

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:20.309
The way a normal mirror works

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.143
is the light rays bounce
off the surface, which is perfect,

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.309
and they focus in a certain point
at the same time.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.309
We take all these recordings,

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.893
and with atomic clock precision

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.268
we align them perfectly,
later in a supercomputer.
