00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.476
SD: First, I would give anything
to be in that spaceship.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.393
(Laughter)

00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:03.708
Sign me up.

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.809
There’s something called the --
if I can get wonky for one moment --

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.601
the innermost stable circular orbit,

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:13.018
that's the innermost orbit at which
matter can move around a black hole

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:14.434
before it spirals in.

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:19.167
And for this black hole, it's going to be
between three days and about a month.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.934
CA: It's so powerful,
it's weirdly slow at one level.

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.809
I mean, you wouldn't even notice

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:30.643
falling into that event horizon
if you were there.
