Chris Anderson: Shep,
thank you so much for coming.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.833
I think your plane landed
literally two hours ago in Vancouver.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.184
Such a treat to have you.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:15.351
So, talk us through how do you get
from Einstein's equation to a black hole?

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.184
Sheperd Doeleman: Over 100 years ago,

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.643
Einstein came up with this
geometric theory of gravity

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.768
which deforms space-time.

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:24.393
So, matter deforms space-time,

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.370
and then space-time tells matter in turn
how to move around it.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.934
And you can get enough matter
into a small enough region
