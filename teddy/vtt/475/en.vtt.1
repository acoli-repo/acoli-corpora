00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.934
And you can get enough matter
into a small enough region

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.184
that it punctures space-time,

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:34.893
and that even light can't escape,

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.018
the force of gravity
keeps even light inside.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.143
CA: And so, before that,
the reason the Earth moves around the Sun

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.809
is not because the Sun
is pulling the Earth as we think,

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:44.976
but it's literally changed
the shape of space

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.101
so that we just
sort of fall around the Sun.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.018
SD: Exactly, the geometry of space-time

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.101
tells the Earth
how to move around the Sun.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.518
You're almost seeing a black hole
puncture through space-time,

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.518
and when it goes so deeply in,

00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:00.018
then there's a point at which
light orbits the black hole.
