WEBVTT

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:31.226
moves around and comes to us
on these parallel lines

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.934
at exactly that orbit.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.601
It turns out, that orbit is
the square root of 27

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:40.601
times just a handful
of fundamental constants.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.643
It's extraordinary
when you think about it.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.601
CA: When ...

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:47.309
In my head, initially,
when I thought of black holes,

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:49.226
I'm thinking that is the event horizon,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.059
there's lots of matter and light
whirling around in that shape.

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:56.268
But it's actually
more complicated than that.

00:05:56.292 --> 00:06:00.726
Well, talk us through this animation,
because it's light being lensed around it.
