00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:33.018
All this gas is trying to get
into a very small volume, so it heats up.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.893
CA: A few years ago,
you embarked on this mission

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.101
to try and actually image
one of these things.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.000
And I guess you took --

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:42.768
you focused on this galaxy way out there.

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:44.601
Tell us about this galaxy.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:46.434
SD: This is the galaxy --

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:50.268
we're going to zoom into the galaxy M87,
it's 55 million light-years away.

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:51.518
CA: Fifty-five million.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:53.559
SD: Which is a long way.

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:55.226
And at its heart,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.934
there's a six-and-a-half-billion-
solar-mass black hole.

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.434
That's hard for us
to really fathom, right?
