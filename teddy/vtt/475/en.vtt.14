00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.143
because the light is actually
being boosted in our direction.

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.143
CA: And how physically big is that?

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:07.976
SD: Our entire solar system
would fit well within that dark region.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.976
And if I may,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.059
that dark region is the signature
of the event horizon.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.059
The reason we don't see light from there,

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.684
is that the light that would come
to us from that place

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:20.434
was swallowed by the event horizon.

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:22.559
So that -- that's it.

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.559
CA: And so when we think of a black hole,

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:27.143
you think of these huge rays
jetting out of it,

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:29.268
which are pointed
directly in our direction.

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:30.643
Why don't we see them?
