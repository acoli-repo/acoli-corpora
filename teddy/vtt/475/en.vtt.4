00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.434
That's hard for us
to really fathom, right?

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:04.726
Six and a half billion suns
compressed into a single point.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.143
And it's governing some of the energetics
of the center of this galaxy.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.643
CA: But even though that thing is so huge,
because it's so far away,

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.559
to actually dream
of getting an image of it,

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:16.851
that's incredibly hard.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:19.184
The resolution would be incredible
that you need.

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:22.226
SD: Black holes are the smallest
objects in the known universe.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.018
But they have these outsize effects
on whole galaxies.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:26.309
But to see one,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.059
you would need to build a telescope
as large as the Earth,

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.184
because the black hole
that we're looking at
