00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.184
because the black hole
that we're looking at

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.684
gives off copious radio waves.

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.059
It's emitting all the time.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:35.851
CA: And that's exactly what you did.

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.643
SD: Exactly. What you're seeing here

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.726
is we used telescopes
all around the world,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.143
we synchronized them perfectly
with atomic clocks,

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:44.691
so they received the light waves
from this black hole,

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:48.684
and then we stitched all of that data
together to make an image.

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:50.000
CA: To do that

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:52.601
the weather had to be right

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.684
in all of those locations
at the same time,

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.601
so you could actually get a clear view.

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.042
SD: We had to get lucky
in a lot of different ways.

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:02.184
And sometimes, it's better
to be lucky than good.
