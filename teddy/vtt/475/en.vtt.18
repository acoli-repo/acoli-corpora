00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:01.101
(Laughter)

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:02.393
CA: Oh, my God.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.559
(Applause)

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.875
It's the red circle, that's terrifying.

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:09.601
No, really.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:13.184
SD: Black holes really are
the central mystery of our age,

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:17.018
because that's where the quantum world
and the gravitational world come together.

00:09:17.042 --> 00:09:18.643
What's inside is a singularity.

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:21.059
And that's where
all the forces become unified,

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:25.684
because gravity finally is strong enough
to compete with all the other forces.

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.101
But it's hidden from us,

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:31.184
the universe has cloaked it
in the ultimate invisibility cloak.
