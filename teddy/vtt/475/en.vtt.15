00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:30.643
Why don't we see them?

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.768
SD: This is a very powerful black hole.

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:36.101
Not by universal standards,
it's still powerful,

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.602
and from the north and south poles
of this black hole

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.351
we think that jets are coming.

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:43.976
Now, we're too close
to really see all the jet structure,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.684
but it's the base of those jets
that are illuminating the space-time.

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.434
And that's what's being bent
around the black hole.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:55.226
CA: And if you were in a spaceship
whirling around that thing somehow,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.726
how long would it take
to actually go around it?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.476
SD: First, I would give anything
to be in that spaceship.
