00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:30.143
We marveled at the resonance
that this image has had.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:33.684
If you told me that it would be
above the fold in all of these newspapers,

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:36.143
I'm not sure I would
have believed you, but it was.

00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:37.724
Because this is a great mystery,

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:41.351
and it's inspiring for us,
and I hope it's inspiring to everyone.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:45.018
But the more important thing is that
this is just a small number of the team.

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:47.934
We're 200 people strong with 60 institutes

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.518
and 20 countries and regions.

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:52.684
If you want to build a global telescope
you need a global team.

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:56.643
And this technique that we use
of linking telescopes around the world

00:10:56.667 --> 00:11:01.226
kind of effortlessly sidesteps
some of the issues that divide us.
