00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:31.184
the universe has cloaked it
in the ultimate invisibility cloak.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.101
So we don't know what happens in there.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.768
CA: So there's a smaller one of these
in our own galaxy.

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:37.934
Can we go back
to our own beautiful galaxy?

00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.726
This is the Milky Way, this is home.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.393
And somewhere in the middle of that
there's another one,

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:44.184
which you're trying to find as well.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:47.351
SD: We already know it's there,
and we've already taken data on it.

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:49.434
And we're working on those data right now.

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:53.309
So we hope to have something
in the near future, I can't say when.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.601
CA: It's way closer
but also a lot smaller,

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.893
maybe the similar kind of size
to what we saw?

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:01.434
SD: Right. So it turns out
that the black hole in M87,
