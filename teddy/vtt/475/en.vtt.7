00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.101
CA: So you started capturing
huge amounts of data.

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:34.143
I think this is like half the data
from just one telescope.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:37.309
SD: Yeah, this is one of the members
of our team, Lindy Blackburn,

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.059
and he's sitting with half the data

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:41.143
recorded at the Large
Millimeter Telescope,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:44.559
which is atop a 15,000-foot
mountain in Mexico.

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:47.893
And what he's holding there
is about half a petabyte.

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.184
Which, to put it in terms
that we might understand,

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:55.143
it's about 5,000 people's
lifetime selfie budget.

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.309
(Laughter)

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.601
CA: It's a lot of data.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.768
So this was all shipped,
you couldn't send this over the internet.
