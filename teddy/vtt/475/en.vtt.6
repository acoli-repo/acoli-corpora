00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:02.184
And sometimes, it's better
to be lucky than good.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.893
In this case, we were both,
I like to think.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.726
But light had to come from the black hole.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.684
It had to come
through intergalactic space,

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.393
through the Earth's atmosphere,
where water vapor can absorb it,

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:17.184
and everything worked out perfectly,

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:19.726
the size of the Earth
at that wavelength of light,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.059
one millimeter wavelength,

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:25.851
was just right to resolve that black hole,
55 million light-years away.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.684
The universe was telling us what to do.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.101
CA: So you started capturing
huge amounts of data.
