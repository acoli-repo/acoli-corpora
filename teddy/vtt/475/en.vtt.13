00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.226
CA: Yeah, that is amazing.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.018
So tell us more about
what we're actually looking at here.

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:38.684
First of all, why is part of it
brighter than the rest?

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:42.476
SD: So what's happening
is that the black hole is spinning.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.893
And you wind up with some of the gas
moving towards us below

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.601
and receding from us on the top.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:50.101
And just as the train whistle
has a higher pitch

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.518
when it's coming towards you,

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:55.309
there's more energy from the gas
coming towards us than going away from us.

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:56.893
You see the bottom part brighter

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.143
because the light is actually
being boosted in our direction.
