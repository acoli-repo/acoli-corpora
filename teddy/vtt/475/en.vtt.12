00:05:56.292 --> 00:06:00.726
Well, talk us through this animation,
because it's light being lensed around it.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.101
SD: You'll see here that some light
from behind it gets lensed,

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:08.518
and some light does a loop-the-loop
around the entire orbit of the black hole.

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:10.018
But when you get enough light

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:12.851
from all this hot gas
swirling around the black hole,

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.768
then you wind up seeing
all of these light rays

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.184
come together on this screen,

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:19.643
which is a stand-in
for where you and I are.

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:24.143
And you see the definition of this ring
begin to come into shape.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:27.542
And that's what Einstein predicted
over 100 years ago.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.226
CA: Yeah, that is amazing.
