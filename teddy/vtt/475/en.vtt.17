00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:30.643
falling into that event horizon
if you were there.

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:32.976
SD: So you may have heard
of "spaghettification,"

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.558
where you fall into a black hole

00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:38.183
and the gravitational field on your feet
is much stronger than on your head,

00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.518
so you're ripped apart.

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.976
This black hole is so big

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.351
that you're not going to become
a spaghetti noodle.

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:48.226
You're just going to drift
right through that event horizon.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.059
CA: So, it's like a giant tornado.

00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:53.601
When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado,
she ended up in Oz.

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:55.976
Where do you end up
if you fall into a black hole?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.851
(Laughter)

00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.143
SD: Vancouver.

00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:01.101
(Laughter)
