00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:04.744
I'm here to talk to you about something
important that may be new to you.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.645
The governments of the world

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:08.933
are about to conduct
an unintentional experiment

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:10.712
on our climate.

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:16.046
In 2020, new rules will require ships
to lower their sulfur emissions

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.178
by scrubbing their dirty exhaust

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:20.153
or switching to cleaner fuels.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.338
For human health, this is really good,

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.696
but sulfur particles
in the emission of ships

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.481
also have an effect on clouds.
