00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a conductor,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and I'm here today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to talk to you about trust.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My job depends upon it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There has to be, between me and the orchestra,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
an unshakable bond of trust,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
born out of mutual respect,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
through which we can spin a musical narrative

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we all believe in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now in the old days, conducting, music making,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Up to and around about the Second World War,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
conductors were invariably dictators --
