You get them to achieve 
unbelievable things.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799
But if the startup 
organization is so great,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.281
why do so many fail?

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.878
That's what I wanted to find out.

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:39.363
I wanted to find out what
actually matters most

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:40.573
for startup success.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.782
And I wanted to try 
to be systematic about it,

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:45.935
avoid some of my instincts
and maybe misperceptions I have

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:48.201
from so many companies
I've seen over the years.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.428
I wanted to know this

00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:52.476
because I've been starting businesses
since I was 12 years old

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.131
when I sold candy at the bus stop
in junior high school,

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:57.442
to high school, when I made
solar energy devices,

00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.229
to college, when I made loudspeakers.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.255
And when I graduated from college,
I started software companies.
