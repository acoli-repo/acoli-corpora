00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:01.513
was when companies were looking for
cost-effective ways to get traffic.

00:05:01.513 --> 00:05:03.085
We thought the idea was so great,

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.846
but actually, the timing was probably
maybe more important.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:07.284
And then some of our failures.

00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:10.761
We started a company called Z.com,
it was an online entertainment company.

00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:12.204
We were so excited about it --

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:14.746
we raised enough money,
we had a great business model,

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:17.994
we even signed incredibly great
Hollywood talent to join the company.

00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:20.382
But broadband penetration
was too low in 1999-2000.

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.538
It was too hard to watch
video content online,

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:25.347
you had to put codecs in your browser
and do all this stuff,

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:27.978
and the company eventually
went out of business in 2003.

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.074
Just two years later,

00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.959
when the codec problem
was solved by Adobe Flash
