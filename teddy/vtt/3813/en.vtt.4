00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.148
Then I started looking
at the business model.

00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:05.398
Does the company have a very clear path
generating customer revenues?

00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:07.502
That started rising to the top
in my thinking

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.819
about maybe what mattered
most for success.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.216
Then I looked at the funding.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.916
Sometimes companies received
intense amounts of funding.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.754
Maybe that's the most important thing?

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.300
And then of course,
the timing.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.110
Is the idea way too early and
the world's not ready for it?

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.557
Is it early, as in, you're in advance
and you have to educate the world?

00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:24.366
Is it just right?

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.229
Or is it too late, and there's
already too many competitors?

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.818
So I tried to look very carefully
at these five factors

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:30.869
across many companies.
