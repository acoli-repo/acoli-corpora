00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.255
And when I graduated from college,
I started software companies.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.064
And 20 years ago,
I started Idealab,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.305
and in the last 20 years,
we started more than 100 companies,

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:09.629
many successes, and many big failures.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.458
We learned a lot from those failures.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.735
So I tried to look across what factors

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:17.898
accounted the most for company
success and failure.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:19.458
So I looked at these five.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.418
First, the idea.

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.574
I used to think that 
the idea was everything.

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.881
I named my company Idealab
for how much I worship

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.474
the "aha!" moment when you first
come up with the idea.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.385
But then over time,

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.970
I came to think that maybe the team,
the execution, adaptability,
