00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.140
Timing accounted for 42 percent

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.640
of the difference
between success and failure.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.742
Team and execution came in second,

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:35.564
and the idea,

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:38.481
the differentiability of the idea,
the uniqueness of the idea,

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:39.884
that actually came in third.

00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:41.849
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.066
it's not to say that 
the idea isn't important,

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:47.706
but it very much surprised me that
the idea wasn't the most important thing.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:50.306
Sometimes it mattered more when 
it was actually timed.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:53.681
The last two, business model and funding,
made sense to me actually.

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.048
I think business model
makes sense to be that low

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.428
because you can start out
without a business model

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.895
and add one later if your customers
are demanding what you're creating.
