00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:30.869
across many companies.

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.064
And I looked across all 100
Idealab companies,

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:34.518
and 100 non-Idealab companies

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:37.154
to try and come up with 
something scientific about it.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.899
So first, on these Idealab companies,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.772
the top five companies --

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:45.188
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,
NetZero, Tickets.com --

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.262
those all became billion-dollar successes.

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:49.175
And the five companies on the bottom --

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.985
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,
Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.376
we all had high hopes for,
but didn't succeed.

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.833
So I tried to rank across all 
of those attributes

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.075
how I felt those companies scored
on each of those dimensions.
