00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.959
when the codec problem
was solved by Adobe Flash

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.633
and when broadband penetration
crossed 50 percent in America,

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.590
YouTube was perfectly timed.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.319
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.759
In fact, YouTube didn't even have
a business model when it first started.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.042
It wasn't even certain that 
that would work out.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:47.177
But that was beautifully, 
beautifully timed.

00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:48.728
So what I would say, in summary,

00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:51.513
is execution definitely matters a lot.

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:52.757
The idea matters a lot.

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:54.516
But timing might matter even more.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.562
And the best way to really assess timing

00:05:56.562 --> 00:05:59.179
is to really look at whether 
consumers are really ready

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.715
for what you have to offer them.
