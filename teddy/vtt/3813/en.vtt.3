00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.970
I came to think that maybe the team,
the execution, adaptability,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.121
that mattered even more than the idea.

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:38.483
I never thought I'd be quoting
boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:40.342
but he once said,

00:01:40.342 --> 00:01:44.945
"Everybody has a plan, until they get
punched in the face." (Laughter)

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.864
And I think that's so true
about business as well.

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:50.140
So much about a team's execution


00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.900
is its ability to adapt to getting punched
in the face by the customer.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.588
The customer is the true reality.

00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.039
And that's why I came to think

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.556
that the team maybe
was the most important thing.
