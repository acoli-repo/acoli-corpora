00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.020
is the timing.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.299
That company came out
right during the height of the recession

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.117
when people really needed extra money,

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:36.931
and that maybe helped people overcome

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.777
their objection to renting out
their own home to a stranger.

00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:40.896
Same thing with Uber.

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:41.949
Uber came out,

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.110
incredible company,
incredible business model,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.174
great execution, too.

00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:46.656
But the timing was so perfect

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.805
for their need to get drivers
into the system.

00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:51.927
Drivers were looking for extra money;
it was very, very important.

00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:55.705
Some of our early successes, Citysearch,
came out when people needed web pages.

00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.182
GoTo.com, which we announced
actually at TED in 1998,

00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:01.513
was when companies were looking for
cost-effective ways to get traffic.
