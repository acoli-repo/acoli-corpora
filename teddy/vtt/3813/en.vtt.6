00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.075
how I felt those companies scored
on each of those dimensions.

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:04.540
And then for non-Idealab companies,
I looked at wild successes,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.122
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber
and Youtube and LinkedIn.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:09.385
And some failures:

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.185
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.465
Flooz and Friendster.

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.469
The bottom companies had intense funding,

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.548
they even had business models
in some cases,

00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:17.695
but they didn't succeed.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.556
I tried to look at what factors
actually accounted the most

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:23.109
for success and failure across
all of these companies,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.938
and the results really surprised me.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.008
The number one thing was timing.

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.140
Timing accounted for 42 percent
