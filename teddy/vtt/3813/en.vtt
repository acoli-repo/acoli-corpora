I'm really excited to share with you

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:05.534
some findings that really surprise me

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:08.085
about what makes companies 
succeed the most,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.987
what factors actually matter the most
for startup success.

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.212
I believe that the startup organization

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:18.970
is one of the greatest forms
to make the world a better place.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.756
If you take a group of people 
with the right equity incentives

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.635
and organize them in a startup,

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:28.609
you can unlock human potential
in a way never before possible.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.139
You get them to achieve 
unbelievable things.
