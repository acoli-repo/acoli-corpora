00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.715
for what you have to offer them.

00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:02.677
And to be really, really honest about it,

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.938
not be in denial about
any results that you see,

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:08.149
because if you have something you love,
you want to push it forward,

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:11.219
but you have to be very, very honest
about that factor on timing.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:12.089
As I said earlier,

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.478
I think startups can change the world
and make the world a better place.

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:16.876
I hope some of these insights

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.528
can maybe help you
have a slightly higher success ratio,

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.748
and thus make something great
come to the world

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.594
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:25.931
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.

00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:27.425
