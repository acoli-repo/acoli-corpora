00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.895
and add one later if your customers
are demanding what you're creating.

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:03.301
And funding, I think as well,

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.076
if you're underfunded at first
but you're gaining traction,

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:07.365
especially in today's age,

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.426
it's very, very easy to get
intense funding.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:12.546
So now let me give you some specific
examples about each of these.

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:15.459
So take a wild success like Airbnb
that everybody knows about.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.524
Well, that company was famously
passed on by many smart investors

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.666
because people thought,

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.719
"No one's going to rent out a space
in their home to a stranger."

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.444
Of course, people proved that wrong.

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:26.298
But one of the reasons it succeeded,

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:29.283
aside from a good business model,
a good idea, great execution,

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.020
is the timing.
