00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.000
During that period, while
the fetal brain is developing,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.942
we know that exposure to certain agents

00:04:31.942 --> 00:04:35.027
can actually increase the risk of autism.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:37.962
In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:40.548
which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:44.220
we know can increase that risk of autism.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.519
In addition, there can be some infectious agents

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.419
that can also cause autism.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.999
And one of the things I'm going to spend

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.060
a lot of time focusing on

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.621
are the genes that can cause autism.

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.077
I'm focusing on this not because genes

00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:00.221
are the only cause of autism,
