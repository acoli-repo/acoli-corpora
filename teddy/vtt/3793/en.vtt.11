00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.860
One of the ways that we can understand

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.723
that genetics is a factor

00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:34.060
is by looking at something called

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.950
the concordance rate.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.138
In other words, if one sibling has autism,

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.625
what's the probability

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.629
that another sibling in that family will have autism?

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.194
And we can look in particular

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:47.362
at three types of siblings:

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.233
identical twins,

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.452
twins that actually share 100 percent

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:53.054
of their genetic information

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:56.230
and shared the same intrauterine environment,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.475
versus fraternal twins,

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.464
twins that actually share 50 percent
