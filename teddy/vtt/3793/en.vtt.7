00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.456
that vaccines cause autism.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.093
Furthermore,

00:03:34.093 --> 00:03:36.562
one of the ingredients in vaccines,

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:38.614
something called thimerosal,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.930
was thought to be what the cause of autism was.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.193
That was actually removed from vaccines

00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:45.918
in the year 1992,

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:48.962
and you can see that it really did not have an effect

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.601
in what happened with the prevalence of autism.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.334
So again, there is no evidence

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.416
that this is the answer.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:59.559
So the question remains, what does cause autism?

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.390
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.
