00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.819
These days, one in 88 children

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.861
will be diagnosed with autism,

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.334
and the question is,

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:37.337
why does this graph look this way?

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.304
Has that number been increasing

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:41.238
dramatically over time?

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:45.769
Or is it because we have now started labeling

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:47.331
individuals with autism,

00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.579
simply giving them a diagnosis

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.132
when they were still present there before

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.525
yet simply didn't have that label?

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:58.516
And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,

00:01:58.516 --> 00:01:59.926
legislation was passed

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:02.565
that actually provided individuals with autism
