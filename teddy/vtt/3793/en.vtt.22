00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:00.932
in terms of how the brain functions.

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:03.078
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:04.787
where we're identifying those genes,

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:07.265
those proteins, those molecules,

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:09.175
understanding how they interact together

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:10.572
to make that neuron work,

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:13.309
understanding how those neurons interact together

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:14.528
to make circuits work,

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:16.544
and understand how those circuits work

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:18.370
to now control behavior,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.170
and understand that both in individuals with autism

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.071
as well as individuals who have normal cognition.

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:27.529
But early diagnosis is a key for us.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:29.488
Being able to make that diagnosis

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.995
of someone who's susceptible
