00:13:58.549 --> 00:14:00.761
All of these new technologies

00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.767
just offer tremendous opportunities

00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:04.672
for us to be able to impact

00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:07.357
the individuals with autism,

00:14:07.357 --> 00:14:09.893
but yet we have a long way to go.

00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:11.203
As much as we know,

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:14.160
there is so much more that we don't know,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.293
and so I invite all of you

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:18.535
to be able to help us think about

00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:19.946
how to do this better,

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:22.825
to use as a community our collective wisdom

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:24.631
to be able to make a difference,

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:25.888
and in particular,

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:28.592
for the individuals in families with autism,

00:14:28.592 --> 00:14:31.847
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,
