00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.713
that causes the autism.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:32.507
However, in other individuals,

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:34.213
it's genetic, that is,

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:37.333
that it's actually a combination of genes

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.128
in part with the developmental process

00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:43.508
that ultimately determines that risk for autism.

00:07:43.508 --> 00:07:46.378
We don't know in any one person, necessarily,

00:07:46.378 --> 00:07:48.471
which of those two answers it is

00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:50.512
until we start digging deeper.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.799
So the question becomes,

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:54.040
how can we start to identify

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.912
what exactly those genes are.

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:57.021
And let me pose something

00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:59.211
that might not be intuitive.

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.570
In certain individuals,
