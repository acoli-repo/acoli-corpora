00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:02.032
to identify things that we might be able to impact

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.730
and can be certain that that's really

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.425
what we need to do in autism.

and we need to be able to educate them

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.753

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:26.671
Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals

00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:28.817
in this room who have great ideas

00:13:28.817 --> 00:13:31.361
in terms of new technologies we can use,
