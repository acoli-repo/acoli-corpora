00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:01.320
in terms of how the brain functions

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.137
and affects behavior.

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:05.514
In doing this within these families,

00:10:05.514 --> 00:10:07.832
we were able to account for approximately

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:10.157
25 percent of the individuals

00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:12.704
and determine that there was a single

00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:14.900
powerful genetic factor

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.024
that caused autism within those families.

00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:20.276
On the other hand, there's 75 percent

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.727
that we still haven't figured out.

00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.197
As we did this, though,

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:26.291
it was really quite humbling,

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.656
because we realized that there was not simply

00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:30.597
one gene for autism.
