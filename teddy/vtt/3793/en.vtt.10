00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:00.221
are the only cause of autism,

00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.790
but it's a cause of autism

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.667
that we can readily define

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.460
and be able to better understand the biology

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.729
and understand better how the brain works

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.714
so that we can come up with strategies

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:13.044
to be able to intervene.

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.990
One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.138
however, is the difference that we see

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.044
in terms of males and females.

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:24.049
Males are affected four to one compared to females

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.151
with autism,

00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:29.142
and we really don't understand what that cause is.

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.860
One of the ways that we can understand
