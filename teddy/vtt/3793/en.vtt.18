00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.802
be able to look at all that genetic information

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.984
and determine what those differences were

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:07.685
between the mother, the father and the child.

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.639
In doing so, I apologize,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.523
I'm going to use an outdated analogy

00:09:11.523 --> 00:09:14.181
of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,

00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:17.180
but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.538
that as we did this inventory,

00:09:19.538 --> 00:09:21.131
we needed to be able to look at

00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:23.304
massive amounts of information.

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:25.591
Our genetic information is organized

00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.478
into a set of 46 volumes,

00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.387
and when we did that, we had to be able to account
