00:14:28.592 --> 00:14:31.847
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,

00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:34.041
to be part of the solution to this,

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.920
because it's going to take really a lot of us

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.190
to think about what's important,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.115
what's going to be a meaningful difference.

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:42.620
As we think about something

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.452
that's potentially a solution,

00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:46.111
how well does it work?

00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:48.059
Is it something that's really
going to make a difference

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:50.428
in your lives, as an individual,

00:14:50.428 --> 00:14:52.081
as a family with autism?

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:54.501
We're going to need individuals of all ages,

00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:56.228
from the young to the old,

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.387
and with all different shapes and sizes

00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:00.224
of the autism spectrum disorder
