WEBVTT

00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.387
and when we did that, we had to be able to account

00:09:30.387 --> 00:09:32.371
for each of those 46 volumes,

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.224
because in some cases with autism,

00:09:34.224 --> 00:09:36.680
there's actually a single volume that's missing.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.990
We had to get more granular than that, though,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.310
and so we had to start opening those books,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.190
and in some cases, the genetic change

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.578
was more subtle.

00:09:44.578 --> 00:09:47.764
It might have been a single
paragraph that was missing,

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:51.042
or yet, even more subtle than that,

00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:52.734
a single letter,

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:55.536
one out of three billion letters

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:57.810
that was changed, that was altered,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.407
yet had profound effects

00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:01.320
in terms of how the brain functions
