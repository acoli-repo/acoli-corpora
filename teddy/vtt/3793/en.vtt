00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:02.231
"Why?"

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.689
"Why?" is a question

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.325
that parents ask me all the time.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.172
"Why did my child develop autism?"

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:13.626
As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:16.069
we try and address that question.

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.018
But autism is not a single condition.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.733
It's actually a spectrum of disorders,

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.267
a spectrum that ranges, for instance,

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.940
from Justin, a 13-year-old boy

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.163
who's not verbal, who can't speak,

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:31.125
who communicates by using an iPad
