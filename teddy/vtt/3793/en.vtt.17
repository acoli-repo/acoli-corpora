WEBVTT

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.365
generation through generation within the family.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:33.546
And we can actually use that strategy

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.880
to now understand and to identify

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.980
those genes causing autism in those individuals.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.990
So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.716
we took 2,600 individuals

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:46.427
that had no family history of autism,

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:49.597
and we took that child and their mother and father

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:52.068
and used them to try and understand

00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:53.687
what were those genes

00:08:53.687 --> 00:08:56.005
causing autism in those cases?

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:59.072
To do that, we actually had to comprehensively

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.802
be able to look at all that genetic information
