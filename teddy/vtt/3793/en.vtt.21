00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:30.597
one gene for autism.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.346
In fact, the current estimates are

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:35.098
that there are 200 to 400 different genes

00:10:35.098 --> 00:10:36.990
that can cause autism.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.359
And that explains, in part,

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:40.476
why we see such a broad spectrum

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.519
in terms of its effects.

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:44.744
Although there are that many genes,

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.092
there is some method to the madness.

00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:49.040
It's not simply random

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.270
200, 400 different genes,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.064
but in fact they fit together.

00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:54.930
They fit together in a pathway.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.402
They fit together in a network

00:10:56.402 --> 00:10:58.234
that's starting to make sense now

00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:00.932
in terms of how the brain functions.
