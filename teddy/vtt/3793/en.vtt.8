00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.390
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.147
Just as autism is a spectrum,

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:06.337
there's a spectrum of etiologies,

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:07.989
a spectrum of causes.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.980
Based on epidemiological data,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.773
we know that one of the causes,

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.930
or one of the associations, I should say,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.214
is advanced paternal age,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.151
that is, increasing age of the father

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:20.330
at the time of conception.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.474
In addition, another vulnerable

00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.104
and critical period in terms of development

00:04:25.104 --> 00:04:27.010
is when the mother is pregnant.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.000
During that period, while
the fetal brain is developing,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.942
we know that exposure to certain agents
