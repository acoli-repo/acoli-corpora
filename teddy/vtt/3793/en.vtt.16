00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.570
In certain individuals,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.294
they can have autism

00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.747
for a reason that is genetic

00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.311
but yet not because of autism running in the family.

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.690
And the reason is because in certain individuals,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.751
they can actually have genetic changes or mutations

00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.794
that are not passed down from the mother

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.281
or from the father,

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.014
but actually start brand new in them,

00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:23.601
mutations that are present

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:25.004
in the egg or the sperm

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.617
at the time of conception

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:28.359
but have not been passed down

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.365
generation through generation within the family.
