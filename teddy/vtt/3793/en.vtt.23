00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.995
of someone who's susceptible

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.050
at a time in a window

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.397
where we have the ability to transform,

00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:37.000
to be able to impact

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.740
that growing, developing brain is critical.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.549
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:46.117
to be able to take infants, small babies,

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:48.650
and be able to use biomarkers,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.988
in this case eye contact and eye tracking,

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:54.074
to identify an infant at risk.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:56.239
This particular infant, you can see,

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.440
making very good eye contact with this woman

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.800
as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"
