00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:30.849
but yet they account for a lot of that risk,

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.162
because when you look at fraternal twins,

00:06:33.162 --> 00:06:36.238
that concordance rate is only 31 percent.

00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:38.149
On the other hand, there is a difference

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:41.092
between those fraternal twins and the siblings,

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.756
suggesting that there are common exposures

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:45.179
for those fraternal twins

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:47.296
that may not be shared as commonly

00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:49.470
with siblings alone.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.156
So this provides some of the data

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:52.778
that autism is genetic.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:54.742
Well, how genetic is it?

00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:56.585
When we compare it to other conditions

00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:58.197
that we're familiar with,

00:06:58.197 --> 00:07:02.077
things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,
