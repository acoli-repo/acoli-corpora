00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.391
"That's terrible. That doesn't look
anything like a horse."

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.543
And Brian's shoulders sank.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.880
And he wadded up the clay horse
and he threw it back in the bin.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:44.089
I never saw Brian do a project
like that ever again.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.256
And I wonder how often
that happens, you know?

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.581
It seems like when I tell
that story of Brian to my class,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.049
a lot of them want to come up after class

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:57.090
and tell me about
their similar experience,

00:00:57.114 --> 00:00:58.724
how a teacher shut them down,

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:01.409
or how a student
was particularly cruel to them.
