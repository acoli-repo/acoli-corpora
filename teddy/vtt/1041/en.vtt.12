00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.848
is take you through and show you
what this journey looks like.

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:05.972
To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:10.140
Doug Dietz is a technical person.

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:13.962
He designs large
medical imaging equipment.

00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:17.692
He's worked for GE, and he's had
a fantastic career.

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:20.668
But at one point,
he had a moment of crisis.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:25.139
He was in the hospital looking
at one of his MRI machines in use,

00:06:25.163 --> 00:06:28.410
when he saw a young family,
and this little girl.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:32.239
And that little girl was crying
and was terrified.
