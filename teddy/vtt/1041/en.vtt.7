00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:31.365
"Hell no! I'm not going in there,
certainly if there's a snake in there."

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.689
But Bandura has a step-by-step
process that was super successful.

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:38.619
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:40.938
looking into the room where the snake was.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.408
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:44.988
Then through a series of steps,

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:48.697
he'd move them and they'd be standing
in the doorway with the door open,

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.235
and they'd be looking in there.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.206
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.920
And then many more steps
later, baby steps,

00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:59.016
they'd be in the room, they'd have
a leather glove like a welder's glove on,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.694
and they'd eventually touch the snake.
