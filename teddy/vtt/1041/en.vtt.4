00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:07.694
So I've been looking
at this fear of judgment that we have,

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:11.200
that you don't do things, you're afraid
you're going to be judged;

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:15.021
if you don't say the right creative thing,
you're going to be judged.

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.716
And I had a major breakthrough,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.907
when I met the psychologist
Albert Bandura.

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.208
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura,
but if you go to Wikipedia,

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:29.374
it says that he's the fourth most
important psychologist in history --

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:33.107
you know, like Freud, Skinner,
somebody and Bandura.
