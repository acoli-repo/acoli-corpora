00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:30.761
And something else happened.

00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:34.724
These people who went through the process
and touched the snake

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:38.251
ended up having less anxiety
about other things in their lives.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.091
They tried harder, they persevered longer,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.871
and they were more resilient
in the face of failure.

00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:48.548
They just gained a new confidence.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.218
And Bandura calls
that confidence "self-efficacy,"

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.487
the sense that you can change the world

00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.335
and that you can attain
what you set out to do.
