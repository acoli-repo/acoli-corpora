and that you can attain
what you set out to do.

00:05:01.457 --> 00:05:04.221
Well, meeting Bandura
was really cathartic for me,

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:07.778
because I realized
that this famous scientist

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:10.962
had documented
and scientifically validated

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:14.377
something that we've seen happen
for the last 30 years:

00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.190
that we could take people who had the fear
that they weren't creative,

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:20.940
and we could take them
through a series of steps,

00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:24.360
kind of like a series of small successes,

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:27.734
and they turn fear into familiarity.

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.790
And they surprise themselves.

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:31.817
That transformation is amazing.
