00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:01.409
or how a student
was particularly cruel to them.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.975
And then some kind of opt out
of thinking of themselves as creative

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:06.154
at that point.

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:10.777
And I see that opting out
that happens in childhood,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.096
and it moves in and becomes
more ingrained, even,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120
by the time you get to adult life.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.278
So we see a lot of this.

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:23.702
When we have a workshop

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.472
or when we have clients
in to work with us side by side,

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:28.773
eventually we get
to the point in the process

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.118
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.
