00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:31.817
That transformation is amazing.

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.237
We see it at the d.school all the time.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.967
People from all different
kinds of disciplines,

00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:39.482
they think of themselves
as only analytical.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:43.010
And they come in and they go
through the process, our process,

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:46.216
they build confidence and now
they think of themselves differently.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.305
And they're totally emotionally excited
about the fact that they walk around

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:53.592
thinking of themselves
as a creative person.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.622
So I thought one
of the things I'd do today

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.848
is take you through and show you
what this journey looks like.
