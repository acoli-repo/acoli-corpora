00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:00.465
And the hospital and GE were happy, too,

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:03.648
because you didn't have to call
the anesthesiologist all the time,

00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:06.480
and they could put more kids
through the machine in a day.

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.411
So the quantitative results were great.

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:12.101
But Doug's results that he cared about
were much more qualitative.

00:08:12.463 --> 00:08:14.189
He was with one of the mothers

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:16.523
waiting for her child
to come out of the scan.

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:18.913
And when the little girl
came out of her scan,

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.833
she ran up to her mother and said,

00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:22.797
"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"

00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.049
(Laughter)

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:29.467
And so, I've heard Doug tell
the story many times

00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.777
of his personal transformation
