00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.118
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:35.281
And eventually, these big-shot executives
whip out their BlackBerrys

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:38.850
and they say they have to make
really important phone calls,

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.445
and they head for the exits.

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.854
And they're just so uncomfortable.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.909
When we track them down
and ask them what's going on,

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.856
they say something like,
"I'm just not the creative type."

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.187
But we know that's not true.

00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:54.371
If they stick with the process,
if they stick with it,

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:56.616
they end up doing amazing things.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.590
And they surprise themselves
at just how innovative

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.785
they and their teams really are.
