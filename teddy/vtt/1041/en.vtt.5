you know, like Freud, Skinner,
somebody and Bandura.

00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:34.543
(Laughter)

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.551
Bandura is 86 and he still
works at Stanford.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.331
And he's just a lovely guy.

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:42.362
So I went to see him,

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:45.888
because he's just worked
on phobias for a long time,

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:47.345
which I'm very interested in.

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.607
He had developed this way,

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:54.357
this, kind of, methodology,

00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.332
that ended up curing people
in a very short amount of time,

00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:58.715
like, in four hours.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.175
He had a huge cure rate
of people who had phobias.
