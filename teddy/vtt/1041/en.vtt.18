00:08:56.948 --> 00:09:00.107
I was told I had a 40 percent
chance of survival.

00:09:00.903 --> 00:09:03.809
So while you're sitting
around with the other patients,

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:05.057
in your pajamas,

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:07.109
and everybody's pale and thin --

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:08.149
(Laughter)

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.438
you know? -- and you're waiting
for your turn to get the gamma rays,

00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:13.114
you think of a lot of things.

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:15.716
Mostly, you think about:
Am I going to survive?

00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.649
And I thought a lot about:

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:20.591
What was my daughter's life
going to be like without me?

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.914
But you think about other things.

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:27.924
I thought a lot about:
What was I put on Earth to do?

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:31.190
What was my calling? What should I do?
