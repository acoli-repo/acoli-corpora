He had a huge cure rate
of people who had phobias.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.163
And we talked about snakes
-- I don't know why --

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:09.369
we talked about snakes
and fear of snakes as a phobia.

00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:13.227
And it was really enjoyable,
really interesting.

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:18.194
He told me that he'd invite
the test subject in,

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:21.105
and he'd say, "You know,
there's a snake in the next room

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.733
and we're going to go in there."

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.561
To which, he reported,
most of them replied,

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:31.365
"Hell no! I'm not going in there,
certainly if there's a snake in there."
