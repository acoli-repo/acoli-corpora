00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:01.898
About that time, he was at the d.school
at Stanford taking classes.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:06.573
He was learning about our process,
about design thinking, about empathy,

00:07:06.597 --> 00:07:08.422
about iterative prototyping.

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:13.135
And he would take this new knowledge
and do something quite extraordinary.

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.896
He would redesign the entire experience

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.158
of being scanned.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.159
And this is what he came up with.

00:07:20.183 --> 00:07:21.202
(Laughter)

00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:23.799
He turned it into
an adventure for the kids.

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:26.081
He painted the walls
and he painted the machine,

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:28.884
and he got the operators retrained
by people who know kids,

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.418
like children's museum people.
