I wanted to talk to you today
about creative confidence.

00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:08.587
I'm going to start way back
in the third grade

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.532
at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:15.977
I remember one day my best friend
Brian was working on a project.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.853
He was making a horse out of the clay
our teacher kept under the sink.

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:25.675
And at one point, one of the girls
that was sitting at his table,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.313
seeing what he was doing,
leaned over and said to him,

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.391
"That's terrible. That doesn't look
anything like a horse."
