00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:32.239
And that little girl was crying
and was terrified.

00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:34.809
And Doug was really disappointed to learn

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:39.497
that nearly 80 percent
of the pediatric patients in this hospital

00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:43.239
had to be sedated in order
to deal with his MRI machine.

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:47.144
And this was really disappointing to Doug,

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.821
because before this time,
he was proud of what he did.

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:51.976
He was saving lives with this machine.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:56.957
But it really hurt him to see the fear
that this machine caused in kids.

00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:01.898
About that time, he was at the d.school
at Stanford taking classes.
