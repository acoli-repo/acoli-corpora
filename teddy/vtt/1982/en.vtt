Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the dramatic moments of the birth

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of our first son, Declan.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Obviously a really profound moment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it changed our lives in many ways.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a year later, we launched Babble,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a website for parents.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.
