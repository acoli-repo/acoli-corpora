00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:08.648
In March of 1892,

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.418
three Black grocery store owners 
in Memphis, Tennessee,

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:14.118
were murdered by a mob of white men.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:17.408
Lynchings like these were happening 
all over the American South,

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:20.048
often without any subsequent legal 
investigation

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.638
or consequences for the murderers.

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:23.628
But this time,

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:25.928
a young journalist and 
friend of the victims

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:28.678
set out to expose the truth 
about these killings.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.578
Her reports would shock the nation
