00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I realized, well, this is a directed attack.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's completely directed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The dropper is prowling actively

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
on the gray box

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
if a specific configuration is found,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is actually running on that target.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So that really got my attention,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we started to work on this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
nearly around the clock,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It could be, let's say for example,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a U.S. power plant,
