Your plant can blow up.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That's scary.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But it gets worse.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Think about this:

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
this attack is generic.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
with centrifuges,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with uranium enrichment.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So it would work as well, for example,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in a power plant

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
or in an automobile factory.
