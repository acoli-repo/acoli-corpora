They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So they know everything.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is complex and high-tech,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
let me tell you this:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the payload is rocket science.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's way above everything

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that we have ever seen before.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We are talking about --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
around about 15,000 lines of code.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I want to tell you how we were able
