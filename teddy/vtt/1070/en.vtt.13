00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that we have actually determined what the target is.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So we don't have to worry

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that other targets

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
might be hit by Stuxnet.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
really knocked my socks off.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Down there is the gray box,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and on the top you see the centrifuges.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now what this thing does

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is it intercepts the input values from sensors --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so for example, from pressure sensors

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and vibration sensors --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and it provides legitimate program code,
