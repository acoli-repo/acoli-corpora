The idea

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is to circumvent a digital safety system.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We need digital safety systems

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
where a human operator could not act quick enough.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So for example, in a power plant,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
you must open relief valves within a millisecond.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So this is where we need digital safety systems.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And when they are compromised,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
then real bad things can happen.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Your plant can blow up.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
