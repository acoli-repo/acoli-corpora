00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is actually quite simple.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The gray boxes that you see,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
these are real-time control systems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now if we manage to compromise these systems

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that control drive speeds and valves,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we can actually cause a lot of problems

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with the centrifuge.
