00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It could be, let's say for example,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a U.S. power plant,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or a chemical plant in Germany.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So we better find out what the target is soon."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So we extracted and decompiled

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the attack code,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
a smaller one and a bigger one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
by people who obviously had all insider information.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They knew all the bits and bites

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that they had to attack.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
