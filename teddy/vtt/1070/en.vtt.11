00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So that made sense, that was a match.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And it even got better.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
These centrifuges in Iran

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And guess what we found in the attack code?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
An almost identical structure.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So again, that was a real good match.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
These results have been obtained

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
over several weeks of really hard labor.
