00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I want to tell you how we were able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to make sense out of this code.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because we know what they do.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And then we were looking for timers and data structures

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and trying to relate them to the real world --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to potential real world targets.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So we do need target theories

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that we can prove or disprove.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In order to get target theories,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we remember

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it must be a high-value target

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it is most likely located in Iran,
