00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
That's the consequence

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that we have to face.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So unfortunately,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the biggest number of targets for such attacks

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
are not in the Middle East.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So all of the green areas,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
these are your target-rich environments.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We have to face the consequences,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and we better start to prepare right now.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Thanks.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
