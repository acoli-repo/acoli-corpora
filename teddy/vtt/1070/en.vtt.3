00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So that got our attention,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we started a lab project

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where we infected our environment with Stuxnet

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and checked this thing out.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And then some very funny things happened.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that didn't like our cheese --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
sniffed, but didn't want to eat.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Didn't make sense to me.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I realized, well, this is a directed attack.
