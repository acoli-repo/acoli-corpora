00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it must be a high-value target

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it is most likely located in Iran,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
because that's where most of the infections had been reported.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It basically boils down

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to the Bushehr nuclear power plant

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I told my assistant,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I phoned them up and picked their brain

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in an effort to match their expertise

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
with what we found in code and data.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that worked pretty well.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we were able to associate
