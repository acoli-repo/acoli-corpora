00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The payload goes onto the gray box,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
damages the centrifuge,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
mission accomplished.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's easy, huh?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want to tell you how we found that out.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The only thing that was known

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it seemed to want to do something

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
