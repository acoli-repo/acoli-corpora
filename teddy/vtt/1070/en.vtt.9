00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that worked pretty well.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we were able to associate

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the small digital warhead

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
with the rotor control.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that black object that you see.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you are actually able to crack the rotor

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What we also saw

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is that the goal of the attack

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
was really to do it slowly and creepy --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
obviously in an effort

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to drive maintenance engineers crazy,
