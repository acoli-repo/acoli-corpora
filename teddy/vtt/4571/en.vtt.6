00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.816
So even though the stage is the same,
a story can be told,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.536
but once a presentation is told,
it completely flatlines.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.096
And I wanted to figure out why.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.496
Why is it that we physically sit
with rapt attention during a story,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.280
but it just dies for a presentation.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.736
So I wanted to figure out, how do you
incorporate story into presentations.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.576
So we've had thousands of presentations
back at the shop --

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.936
hundreds of thousands
of presentations, actually,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.416
so I knew the context
of a really bad presentation.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.096
I decided to study cinema and literature,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.496
and really dig in
and figure out what was going on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.920
and why it was broken.
