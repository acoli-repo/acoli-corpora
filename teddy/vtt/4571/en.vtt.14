00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.056
Here's a roadblock,
let's annihilate the roadblock.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.136
You need to really amplify that gap.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.976
This would be like
the inciting incident in a movie.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.256
That's when suddenly
the audience has to contend

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.856
with what you just put out there:

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.776
"Wow, do I want to agree
with this and align with it or not?"

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.520
And in the rest of your presentation
should support that.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.496
So the middle goes back and forth,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.736
it traverses between
what is and what could be,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.056
what is and what could be.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.696
Because what you are trying to do

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.816
is make the status quo
and the normal unappealing,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.336
and you're wanting to draw them

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.160
towards what could be
in the future with your idea adopted.
