00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.896
So he's definitely changed the world.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.896
And this is the shape
of his iPhone launch 2007,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.296
when he launched his iPhone.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.216
It's a 90-minute talk
and you can see he starts with what is,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.800

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.616

that's when he cuts to video.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.936
So he's adding some variety
and he cuts to demo.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.056
So it's not just him
talking the whole time.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.520
And these lines are representative there.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.656
And then towards the end
you'll see a blue line,
