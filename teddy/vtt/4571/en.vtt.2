Every time we go to Maui,
we go to the dealer there,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.856
and he turns these great big posters.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.696
I love them. They all have one idea

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.296
and one really clear visual
that conveys the idea.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.096
They are about the size of a mattress.
They're really big.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.616
They're not as thick as a mattress,
but they're big.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.176
And the guy will tell the story
as he turns the pages.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.376
And this one time
I was flanked by my two kids

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.176
and he turns the page
and this poster is underneath,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.056
and right when I lean forward and say,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.736
"Oh my God, I love this poster,"

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.936
both of my kids jumped back
and they are like,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.296
"Oh my God, mom, it's you."

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.536
And this is the poster.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.856
(Laughter)
