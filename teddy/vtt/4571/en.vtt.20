00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.176
So this is not a new product to him.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.416
But look at this,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.256
he does this other thing: he marvels.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.736
He marvels at his own product.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.496
He marvels himself
more than the audience laughs or claps.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.016
So he is like, "Isn't this awesome?
Isn't this beautiful?"

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.616
He is modeling for the audience
what he wants them to feel.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.680
So he is actually doing a job
of compelling them to feel a certain way.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.936
So he kicks off with what could be with,
"Every once in a while,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.896
a revolutionary product comes along
that changes everything."

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.536
So he starts to kick in
and talk about his new product.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.456
Now, at the beginning of it,
he actually keeps the phone off.
