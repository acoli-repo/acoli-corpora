back when it wasn't cool

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.856
I really think they have the power
to change the world

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.296
when you communicate
effectively through them.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.496
And changing the world is hard.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.896
It won't happen with just one person

That idea has got to spread,
or it won't be effective.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.136
So it has to come out of you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.280
and out into the open for people to see.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.976
And the way that ideas are conveyed
the most effectively is through story.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.616

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.056
illiterate generations would pass on
their values and their culture
