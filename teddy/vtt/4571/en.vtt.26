00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.176
And then he also made
a lot of political references

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.336
of the promises
that were made to the people.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.576
So if we look at

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.656
So he used the metaphor

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.416
the very first time
they really screamed was:

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.496
"So we have come to cash this check,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.616
a check that will give us upon demand
