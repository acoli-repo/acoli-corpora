00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.920
in a very poetic and dramatic way.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.496
So, interestingly, when I was done,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.015
I was like, "You know what?
I could use this as an analysis tool."

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.056
I actually transcribe speeches,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.496
and I would actually map out,
how much they map to this tool.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.473
So I want to show you some of that today,

00:08:46.497 --> 00:08:48.576
and I want to start
with the very two people

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.016
that I used when I first did.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.816
Here's Mr. Jobs,
has completely changed the world.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.016
Changed the world of personal computing,
changed the music industry

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.976
and now he's on his way
to change the mobile device industry.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.896
So he's definitely changed the world.
