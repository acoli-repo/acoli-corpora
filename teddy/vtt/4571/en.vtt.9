00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.267
They're like, "I don't know
if I want to jump into this,"

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.696
and then a mentor comes along

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.856
and helps them move
from their ordinary world

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.096
into a special world.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.936
And that's the role of the presenter.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.936
It's to be the mentor.
You're not Luke Skywalker, you're Yoda.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.176
You're the one
that actually helps the audience

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.776
move from one thing
and into your new special idea,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.324
and that's the power of a story.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.096
So in its most simple structure,
it's a three-part structure of a story.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.856
You have a likable hero who has a desire,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.536
they encounter a roadblock

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.000
and ultimately they emerge, transform,
and that's the basic structure.
