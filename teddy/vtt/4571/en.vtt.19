00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.656
And then towards the end
you'll see a blue line,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.256
which will be the guest speaker.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.416
So this is where it gets
kind of interesting:

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.736
every tick mark here
is when he made them laugh.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.256
And every tick mark here
is when he made them clap.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.136
They are so involved physically,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.536
they are physically reacting
to what he is saying,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.936
which is actually fantastic,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.016
because then you know
you have the audience in your hand.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.136
So he kicks off what could be with,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.496
"This is a day I've been looking
forward to for two and a half years."

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.936
So he is launching a product

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.416
that he's known about already
for a couple of years.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.176
So this is not a new product to him.
