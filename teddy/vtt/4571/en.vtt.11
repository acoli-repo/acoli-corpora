00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.080
We talk about classical music
having a shapeliness to it.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.856
So I thought, hey,
if presentations had a shape,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.136
what would that shape be?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.216
And how did the greatest
communicators use that shape,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.776
or do they use a shape?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.056
So I'll never forget,
it was a Saturday morning.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.936
After all this study --
it was a couple of years of study --

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.176
I drew a shape.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.616
And I was like,
"Oh my gosh, if this shape is real,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.656
I should be able to take
two completely different presentations

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.536
and overlay it, and it should be true."

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.816
So I took the obvious,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.296
I took Martin Luther King's
"I Have a Dream" speech,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.696
and I took Steve Jobs'
2007 iPhone launch speech,
