00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.016
where the external speakers are going,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.216
and towards the bottom right,
the line breaks.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.856
That's because his clicker broke.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.376
He wants to keep
this heightened sense of excitement.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.896
He tells a personal story,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.096
right there, where
the technology didn't work.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.696
So he's the master communicator,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.160
and he turns to story
to keep the audience involved.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.976
So the top right
he ends with the new bliss.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.576
He leaves them with the promise

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.176
that Apple will continue
to build revolutionary new products.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.400
And he says,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.576
"There's an old Wayne Gretzky
quote that I love:

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.856
'I skate to where the puck is going to be,
not to where it has been.'
