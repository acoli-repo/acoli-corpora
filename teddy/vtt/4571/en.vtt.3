00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.856
(Laughter)

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.136
See, I'm like "Fire it up!"

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.696
The thing I loved
about this poster was the irony.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.216
Here's this chick all fired up,
headed into battle --

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.496
as the standard bearer --

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.536
and she's holding these
little Suavitos baking spices,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.416
like something so seemingly insignificant,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360
though she's willing to risk, you know,
life and limb to promote this thing.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.696
So if you are to swap out
those little Suavitos baking spices

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.976
with a presentation --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.336
Yeah, it's me, pretty fired up.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.016
I was fired up about presentations

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.256
back when it wasn't cool
to be fired up about presentations.
