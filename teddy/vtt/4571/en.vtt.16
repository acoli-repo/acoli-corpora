00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.856
your ship will actually
sail faster than the wind itself.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.216
It is a physics phenomenon.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.496
So by planting in there

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.536
the way they're going to resist
between what is and what can be,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.816
is actually going to draw
them towards your idea

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.576
quicker than should you not do that.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.056
So after you've moved back and forth
between what is and what could be,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.096
the last turning point
is a call to action,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.936
which every presentation should have,
but at the very end.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.136
You need to describe the world
as a new bliss.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.456
"This is utopia with my idea adopted."

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.576
"This is the way
the world is going to look,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.096
when we join together
and we solve this big problem."

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.856
You need to use that as your ending,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.920
in a very poetic and dramatic way.
