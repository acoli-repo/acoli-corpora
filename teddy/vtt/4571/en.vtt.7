00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.376
So, I want to show you
some of the findings

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.920
that led up to what I've uncovered
as a presentation form.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.056
So it was obvious to start with Aristotle,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.056
he had a three-act structure,
a beginning, a middle and an end.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.656
We studied poetics and rhetoric,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.136
and a lot of presentations don't even
have that in its most simple form.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.656
And then when I moved on
to studying hero archetypes,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.736
I thought, "OK, the presenter is the hero,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.416
they're up on the stage,
they're the star of the show."

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.816
It's easy to feel, as the presenter,
that you're the star of the show.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.176
I realized right away,
that that's really broken.
