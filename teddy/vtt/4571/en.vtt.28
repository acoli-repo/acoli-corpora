00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.096
that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the meaning of its creed.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.816
'We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal.'"

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.096
So he uses the little orange text there
to remind them of the promise

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.296
that the politicians had made to him
or that this country had made.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.056
Then he moves back and forth between

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.795
"I have a dream that one day,
I have a dream that one day,

00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:17.216
I have a dream that one day,"

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.336
and at the end,
it gets really interesting.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.216
Because he uses --
you can look at the four shades of green,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.136
there's a lot of blue there,
which was a lot of repetition --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.096
he had a heightened sense of repetition.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.256
And the green was a heightened sense
of songs and scriptures.
