00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.176
I realized right away,
that that's really broken.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.056
Because I have an idea,
I can put it out there,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.776
but if you guys don't grab that idea
and hold it as dear,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.296
the idea goes nowhere
and the world is never changed.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.536
So in reality,
the presenter isn't the hero,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.080
the audience is the hero of our idea.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.096
So if you look at
Joseph Campbell's hero's journey,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.596
just in the front part, there were
some really interesting insights there.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.016
So there is this likable hero
in an ordinary world,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.776
and they get this call to adventure.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.016
So the world is
kind of brought out of balance.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.576
And at first they're resistant.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.267
They're like, "I don't know
if I want to jump into this,"
