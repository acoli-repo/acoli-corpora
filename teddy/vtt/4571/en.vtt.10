00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.000
and ultimately they emerge, transform,
and that's the basic structure.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.056
But it wasn't until I came across
a Gustav Freytag's pyramid --

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.016
he drew this shape in 1863.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.336
Now, he was a German dramatist ...

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.616
he was a German dramatist

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.536
and he believed
there is a five-act structure,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.576
which has an exposition, a rising action,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.176
a climax, a falling action
and a denouement,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.336
which is the unraveling
or the resolution of the story.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.456
I love this shape.
So we talk about shapes.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.856
A story has an arc --
well, an arc is a shape.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.080
We talk about classical music
having a shapeliness to it.
