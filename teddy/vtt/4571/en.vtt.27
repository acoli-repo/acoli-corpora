00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.016

It was when he compared
what currently is to what could be.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.736

to keep them in a heightened
sense of excitement.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.560
So he says, "I have a dream

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.096
that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the meaning of its creed.
