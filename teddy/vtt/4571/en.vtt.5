00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.056
illiterate generations would pass on
their values and their culture

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.776
from generation to generation,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.456
and they would stay intact.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.336
So there's something kind of magical
about a story structure

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.536
that makes it so that when it's assembled,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.816
it can be ingested and then recalled

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.440
by the person who's receiving it.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.256
So basically a story,
you get a physical reaction;

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.096
your heart can race, your eyes can dilate,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.736
you could talk about,
"Oh, I got a chill down my spine"

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.976
or, "I could feel it
in the pit of my stomach."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.056
We actually physically react
when someone is telling us a story.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.816
So even though the stage is the same,
a story can be told,
