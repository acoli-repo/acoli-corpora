00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.616
It's really, really great to be here.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.536
You have the power to change the world.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.216
I’m not saying that to be cliché,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.560
you really have the power
to change the world.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.136
Deep inside of you,
every single one of you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
has the most powerful device known to man.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.280

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.856
it could start a groundswell,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.656
it could be a flash point for a movement

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.456
and it can actually rewrite our future.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.176
But an idea is powerless
