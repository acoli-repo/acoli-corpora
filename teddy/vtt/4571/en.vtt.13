00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.896
Even the Gettysburg Address
follows the shape.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.136
At the beginning of any presentation,
you need to establish what is.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.816
You know, here's the status quo,
here's what's going on.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.256
And then you need
to compare that to what could be.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.136
You need to make that gap
as big as possible,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.616
because there is this commonplace
of the status quo,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.576
and you need to contrast that
with the loftiness of your idea.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.456
So it's like, you know,
here's the past, here's the present,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.720
but look at our future.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.056
Here's a problem,
but look at that problem removed.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.056
Here's a roadblock,
let's annihilate the roadblock.
