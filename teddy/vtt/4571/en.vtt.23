'I skate to where the puck is going to be,
not to where it has been.'

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.856
We've always tried to do that
at Apple since the very beginning

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.136
and we always will."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.616
So he ends with the new bliss.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.896
So let's look at Mr. King.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.456
He was an amazing visionary, a clergyman

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.136
who spent his life

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.136

between what is and what could be,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.296
and ends with a very poetic new bliss,
which is the famous part we all know.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.576
So I'm going to spread it out
a little bit here,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.256
stretch it for you,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.136
and what I'm doing here is
I put the actual transcript there
