00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.800
and that is worth worrying about.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.616
Consider two countries,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.776
Norway and Saudi Arabia.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.376
Both oil-rich nations,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.976
it's like they have money
spurting out of a hole in the ground.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.536
(Laughter)

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.776
But they haven't used that wealth
equally well to foster human prosperity,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.000
human prospering.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.176
Norway is a thriving democracy.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.856
By and large, its citizens
work and play well together.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.896
It's typically numbered
between first and fourth

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.656
in rankings of national happiness.
