00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.536
with machine perfection.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.776
Computers were programmed to swap out

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.456
error-prone, inconsistent
human calculation

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.240
with digital perfection.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.936
These inventions have worked.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.016
We no longer dig ditches by hand,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.096
pound tools out of wrought iron

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.400
or do bookkeeping using actual books.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.976
And yet, the fraction of US adults
employed in the labor market

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.856
is higher now in 2016

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.616
than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.656
and it's risen in just about every decade
