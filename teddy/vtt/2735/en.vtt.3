00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.656
and it's risen in just about every decade

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.000
in the intervening 125 years.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.240
This poses a paradox.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.816
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.976
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant
and our skills obsolete?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.696
Why are there still so many jobs?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.456
(Laughter)

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.816
I'm going to try to answer
that question tonight,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.576
and along the way, I'm going to tell you
what this means for the future of work

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.776
and the challenges that automation
does and does not pose

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.240
for our society.
