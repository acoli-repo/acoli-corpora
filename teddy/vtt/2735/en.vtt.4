00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.240
for our society.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280
Why are there so many jobs?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.056
There are actually two fundamental
economic principles at stake.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.776
One has to do with human genius

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.216
and creativity.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.096
The other has to do
with human insatiability,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.696
or greed, if you like.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.456
I'm going to call the first of these
the O-ring principle,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.656
and it determines
the type of work that we do.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.296
The second principle
is the never-get-enough principle,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.800
and it determines how many jobs
there actually are.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.776
Let's start with the O-ring.
