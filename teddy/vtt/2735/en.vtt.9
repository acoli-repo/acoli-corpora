00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.576
is the O-ring production function,

named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.136
after the Challenger disaster.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.736
The O-ring production function

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.096
as a series of interlocking steps,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.376
links in a chain.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.096
Every one of those links must hold
for the mission to succeed.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.256
If any of them fails,

or the service,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.920

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.496
This precarious situation
has a surprisingly positive implication,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.416
which is that improvements
