economist James Bessen,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.616
raise an intriguing question:

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.536
what are all those tellers doing,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.576
and why hasn't automation
eliminated their employment by now?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.936
If you think about it,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.096
many of the great inventions
of the last 200 years

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.920
were designed to replace human labor.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.496
Tractors were developed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.856
to substitute mechanical power
for human physical toil.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.216
Assembly lines were engineered

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.576
to replace inconsistent human handiwork

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.536
with machine perfection.
