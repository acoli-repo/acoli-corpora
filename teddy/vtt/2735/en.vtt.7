and brains and brawn,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.976
technical expertise and intuitive mastery,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.960
perspiration and inspiration
in the words of Thomas Edison.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.736
In general, automating
some subset of those tasks

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.976
doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.960
In fact, it makes them more important.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.056
It increases their economic value.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.096
Let me give you a stark example.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.936
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.256
exploded and crashed back down to Earth

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200
less than two minutes after takeoff.
