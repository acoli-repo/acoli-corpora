00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.416
in the reliability
of any one link in the chain

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.216
increases the value
of improving any of the other links.

Concretely, if most of the links
are brittle and prone to breakage,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.696
the fact that your link
is not that reliable

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.976
is not that important.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Probably something else will break anyway.

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:22.016

become robust and reliable,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.536

becomes more essential.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.880
In the limit, everything depends upon it.
