00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.720
Now ...

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.256
So if you accept these two principles,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.176
the O-ring principle
and the never-get-enough principle,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.536
then you agree with me.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960
There will be jobs.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.736
Does that mean there's
nothing to worry about?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.536
Automation, employment, robots and jobs --

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.480
it'll all take care of itself?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.336
No.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.416
That is not my argument.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.976
Automation creates wealth

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.576
by allowing us to do
more work in less time.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.176
There is no economic law

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.976
that says that we
will use that wealth well,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.800
and that is worth worrying about.
