There are many others like it.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.416
But what's true about a single product
or service or industry

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.216
has never been true
about the economy as a whole.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.736
Many of the industries
in which we now work --

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.896
health and medicine,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.136
finance and insurance,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.800
electronics and computing --

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.456
were tiny or barely existent
a century ago.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.296
Many of the products
that we spend a lot of our money on --

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.456
air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.176
computers and mobile devices --

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.856
were unattainably expensive,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.320
or just hadn't been invented
a century ago.
