00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.976
faster and better than tellers,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.056
but that didn't make tellers superfluous.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.376
It increased the importance
of their problem-solving skills

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.016
and their relationships with customers.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.336
The same principle applies
if we're building a building,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.896
if we're diagnosing
and caring for a patient,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.056
or if we are teaching a class

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.536
to a roomful of high schoolers.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.936
As our tools improve,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.056
technology magnifies our leverage

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.976
and increases the importance
of our expertise

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.200
and our judgment and our creativity.
