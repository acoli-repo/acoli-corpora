00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.776
Let's start with the O-ring.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.576
ATMs, automated teller machines,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.936
had two countervailing effects
on bank teller employment.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.656
As you would expect,
they replaced a lot of teller tasks.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.360
The number of tellers per branch
fell by about a third.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.056
But banks quickly discovered that it
also was cheaper to open new branches,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.216
and the number of bank branches
increased by about 40 percent

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.736
in the same time period.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
The net result was more branches
and more tellers.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.856
But those tellers were doing
somewhat different work.
