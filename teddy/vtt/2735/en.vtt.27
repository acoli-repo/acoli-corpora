00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.416
but those kids couldn't work
at their jobs.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.736
It also turned out to be
one of the best investments

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.976
the US made in the 20th century.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.336
It gave us the most skilled,
the most flexible

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.056
and the most productive
workforce in the world.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.616
To see how well this worked,
imagine taking the labor force of 1899

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.856
and bringing them into the present.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.816
Despite their strong backs
and good characters,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.616
many of them would lack
the basic literacy and numeracy skills

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.576
to do all but the most mundane jobs.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.840
Many of them would be unemployable.
