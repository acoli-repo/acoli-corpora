00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200
less than two minutes after takeoff.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.816
The cause of that crash, it turned out,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.376
was an inexpensive rubber O-ring
in the booster rocket

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.256
that had frozen on the launchpad
the night before

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.656
and failed catastrophically
moments after takeoff.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.495
In this multibillion dollar enterprise

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.216
that simple rubber O-ring

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.815
made the difference
between mission success

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.680
and the calamitous death
of seven astronauts.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.336
An ingenious metaphor
for this tragic setting

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.576
is the O-ring production function,
