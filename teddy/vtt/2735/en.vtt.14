00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.976
was on farms.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.256
Today, it's less than two percent.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.456
Why are there so few farmers today?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.336
It's not because we're eating less.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.016
(Laughter)

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.776
A century of productivity
growth in farming

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.976
means that now,
a couple of million farmers

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.736
can feed a nation of 320 million.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.416
That's amazing progress,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.576
but it also means there are
only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.616
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.376
Farming is only one example.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.040
There are many others like it.
