00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.936
remember that tractor? --

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.656
the farm states faced a threat
of mass unemployment,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.496
a generation of youth
no longer needed on the farm

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.280
but not prepared for industry.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.656
Rising to this challenge,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.176
they took the radical step

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.016
of requiring that
their entire youth population

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.896
remain in school
and continue their education

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.040
to the ripe old age of 16.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.576
This was called the high school movement,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.416
and it was a radically
expensive thing to do.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.696
Not only did they have
to invest in the schools,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.416
but those kids couldn't work
at their jobs.
