use well-understood rules and procedures

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.256
that can increasingly
be codified in software

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.640
and executed by computers.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.576
The challenge that
this phenomenon creates,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.136
what economists call
employment polarization,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.776
is that it knocks out rungs
in the economic ladder,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.616
shrinks the size of the middle class

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.776
and threatens to make us
a more stratified society.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.856
On the one hand, a set of highly paid,
highly educated professionals

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.296
doing interesting work,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.736
on the other, a large number
of citizens in low-paid jobs

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.416
whose primary responsibility is to see
to the comfort and health of the affluent.
