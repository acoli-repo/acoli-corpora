Here's a startling fact:

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:06.816

those vending machines that dispense cash,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.896
the number of human bank tellers
employed in the United States

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.176
has roughly doubled,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.496
from about a quarter of a million
to a half a million.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.556
A quarter of a million in 1970
to about a half a million today,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.816
with 100,000 added since the year 2000.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.256
These facts, revealed in a recent book

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.416
