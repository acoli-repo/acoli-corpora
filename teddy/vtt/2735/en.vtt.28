00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.840
Many of them would be unemployable.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.576
What this example highlights
is the primacy of our institutions,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.376
most especially our schools,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.936
in allowing us to reap the harvest

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.256
of our technological prosperity.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.696
It's foolish to say
there's nothing to worry about.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.920
Clearly we can get this wrong.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.136
If the US had not invested
in its schools and in its skills

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.416
a century ago with
the high school movement,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.096
we would be a less prosperous,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.736
a less mobile and probably
a lot less happy society.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.496
But it's equally foolish
to say that our fates are sealed.
