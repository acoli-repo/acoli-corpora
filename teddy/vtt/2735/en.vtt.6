But those tellers were doing
somewhat different work.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.536
As their routine,
cash-handling tasks receded,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.696

and more like salespeople,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.616
forging relationships with customers,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.856
solving problems

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.096
and introducing them to new products
like credit cards, loans and investments:

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.960
more tellers doing
a more cognitively demanding job.

Most of the work that we do

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.320
requires a multiplicity of skills,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.336
and brains and brawn,
