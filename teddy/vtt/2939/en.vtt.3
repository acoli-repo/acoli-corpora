00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.390
But that tends to be a very human-centric
view of intelligence.

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:33.351
When you think of a fish school,

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.328
or when I think of a flock of starlings,

00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:39.692
that feels like a really different
kind of intelligence.

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:44.858
For starters, any one fish is just so tiny

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.769
compared to the sheer size
of the collective,

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:50.903
so it seems that any one individual

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.920
would have a really limited
and myopic view of what's going on,

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:56.278
and intelligence
isn't really about the individual

00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:58.979
but somehow a property
of the group itself.
