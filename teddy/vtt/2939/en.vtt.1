00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.588
And then, as if it had
suddenly changed its mind,

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.049
came towards me
and then swerved to the right

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:36.588
and went right around me.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.446
It was absolutely mesmerizing.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.652
Maybe many of you
have had this experience.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.661
Of course, there's the color
and the beauty of it,

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.613
but there was also
just the sheer oneness of it,

00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:49.980
as if it wasn't hundreds of fish

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.139
but a single entity
with a single collective mind

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:54.670
that was making decisions.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.348
When I look back, I think that experience
really ended up determining

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.594
what I've worked on for most of my career.
