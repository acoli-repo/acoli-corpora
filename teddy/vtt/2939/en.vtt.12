00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.831
And here, we can take inspiration
from social insects.

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.849
So if you think about
mound-building termites

00:06:04.873 --> 00:06:06.925
or you think about army ants,

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.202
they create incredible,
complex nest structures out of mud

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:13.370
and even out of their own bodies.

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:16.822
And like the system I showed you before,

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:19.816
these insects actually
also have pattern rules

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.878
that help them determine what to build,

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:24.204
but the pattern can be made
out of other insects,

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:26.015
or it could be made out of mud.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:31.539
And we can use that same idea
to create rules for robots.
