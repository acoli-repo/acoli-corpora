00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.569
what are those rules of engagement
that lead to this kind of intelligence,

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.500
and of course, can we create our own?

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.586
And that's the primary thing
that I work on with my team in my lab.

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:40.580
We work on it through theory,

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:42.952
looking at abstract rule systems

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.325
and thinking about
the mathematics behind it.

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:50.182
We also do it through biology,
working closely with experimentalists.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.532
But mostly, we do it through robotics,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:56.460
where we try to create
our own collective systems

00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:59.191
that can do the kinds of things
that we see in nature,

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:00.452
or at least try to.
