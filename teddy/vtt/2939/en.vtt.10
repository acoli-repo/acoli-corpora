00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:02.859
So here, you're going to see
a thousand robots

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:06.345
that are working together
to self-assemble the letter K.

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:07.675
The K is on its side.

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:10.954
And the important thing
is that no one is in charge.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:15.803
So any single robot is only talking
to a small number of robots nearby it,

00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:19.764
and it's using its motion rule
to move around the half-built structure

00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.795
just looking for a place to fit in
based on its pattern rules.

00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:28.192
And even though no robot
is doing anything perfectly,

00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:31.876
the rules are such that we can get
the collective to do its goal
