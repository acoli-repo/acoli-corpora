In my early days as a graduate student,

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:06.349
I went on a snorkeling trip
off the coast of the Bahamas.

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.738
I'd actually never swum
in the ocean before,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.606
so it was a bit terrifying.

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:15.016
What I remember the most is,
as I put my head in the water

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.290
and I was trying really hard
to breathe through the snorkel,

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:24.680
this huge group
of striped yellow and black fish

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.187
came straight at me ...

00:00:26.817 --> 00:00:28.214
and I just froze.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.588
And then, as if it had
suddenly changed its mind,
