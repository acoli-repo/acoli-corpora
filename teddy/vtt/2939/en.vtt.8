00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.546
determine what role
they're going to take on

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.276
and set the patterns of our bodies.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.134
We can program rules for migration,

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.135
and in this way, we're really learning
from nature's rules.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.242
But we can also take it a step further.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:16.258
We can actually take these rules
that we've learned from nature

00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:20.076
and combine them and create
entirely new collective behaviors

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.298
of our very own.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.438
So for example,

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.814
imagine that you had
two different kinds of rules.

00:04:26.374 --> 00:04:28.493
So your first rule is a motion rule

00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:32.858
where a moving robot can move
around other stationary robots.
