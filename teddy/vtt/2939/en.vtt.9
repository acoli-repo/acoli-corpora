00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:32.858
where a moving robot can move
around other stationary robots.

00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:34.693
And your second rule is a pattern rule

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:37.874
where a robot takes on a color
based on its two nearest neighbors.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.124
So if I start with a blob of robots
in a little pattern seed,

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.054
it turns out that these two rules
are sufficient for the group

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:47.830
to be able to self-assemble
a simple line pattern.

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:51.658
And if I have more
complicated pattern rules,

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:53.999
and I design error correction rules,

00:04:54.023 --> 00:04:57.120
we can actually create really,
really complicated self assemblies,

00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:58.788
and here's what that looks like.

00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:02.859
So here, you're going to see
a thousand robots
