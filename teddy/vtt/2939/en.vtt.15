00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:31.078
and could help build levees,

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:35.403
or we could think of robots
that built out of soft materials

00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:39.071
and worked together
to shore up a collapsed building --

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:42.093
so just the same kind of rules
in different kinds of bodies.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.433
Or if, like my group, you are completely
obsessed with army ants,

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:52.831
then maybe one day we can make robots
that can climb over literally anything

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:55.029
including other members of their tribe,

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:57.402
and self-assemble things
out of their own bodies.

00:07:58.137 --> 00:07:59.818
Once you understand the rules,

00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:03.221
just many different kinds
of robot visions become possible.
