00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:00.452
or at least try to.

00:03:01.907 --> 00:03:04.711
One of our first robotic quests
along this line

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:08.780
was to create our very own colony
of a thousand robots.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.474
So very simple robots,

00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:14.101
but they could be programmed
to exhibit collective intelligence,

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.854
and that's what we were able to do.

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:18.226
So this is what a single robot looks like.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.773
It's quite small,
about the size of a quarter,

00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:23.107
and you can program how it moves,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:26.547
but it can also wirelessly
communicate with other robots,

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:28.738
and it can measure distances from them.

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:32.238
And so now we can start to program
exactly an interaction,
