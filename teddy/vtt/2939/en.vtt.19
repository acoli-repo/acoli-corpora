but unlike the beautiful
fish schools that I study,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:35.818
I feel we still have a much longer
evolutionary path to walk.

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:41.350
So in addition to working on improving
the science of robot collectives,

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.651
I also work on creating robots
and thinking about rules

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:47.135
that will improve
our own scientific collective.

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:49.866
There's this saying that I love:

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.294
who does science
determines what science gets done.

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:57.180
Imagine a society

00:09:57.204 --> 00:09:58.855
where we had rules of engagement

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:02.182
where every child grew up believing
that they could stand here
