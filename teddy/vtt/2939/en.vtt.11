00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:31.876
the rules are such that we can get
the collective to do its goal

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.373
robustly together.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.015
And the illusion becomes
almost so perfect, you know --

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.455
you just start to not even notice
that they're individual robots at all,

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.162
and it becomes a single entity,

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:43.907
kind of like the school of fish.

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:50.752
So these are robots and rules
in two dimensions,

00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:54.087
but we can also think about robots
and rules in three dimensions.

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:57.714
So what if we could create robots
that could build together?

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.831
And here, we can take inspiration
from social insects.
