00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:02.182
where every child grew up believing
that they could stand here

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:04.628
and be a technologist of the future,

00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:06.153
or where every adult

00:10:06.177 --> 00:10:10.296
believed that they had the ability
not just to understand but to change

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.875
how science and technology
impacts their everyday lives.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.719
What would that society look like?

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:19.894
I believe that we can do that.

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:22.209
I believe that we can choose our rules,

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.990
and we engineer not just robots

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:26.610
but we can engineer
our own human collective,

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:30.468
and if we do and when we do,
it will be beautiful.
