00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:31.539
And we can use that same idea
to create rules for robots.

00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:35.382
So here, you're going to see
some simulated robots.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:37.889
So the simulated robot has a motion rule,

00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:40.246
which is how it traverses
through the structure,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.267
looking for a place to fit in,

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.291
and it has pattern rules
where it looks at groups of blocks

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:47.520
to decide whether to place a block.

00:06:48.644 --> 00:06:51.707
And with the right motion rules
and the right pattern rules,

00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:55.366
we can actually get the robots
to build whatever we want.

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:58.888
And of course, everybody wants
their own tower.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.332
