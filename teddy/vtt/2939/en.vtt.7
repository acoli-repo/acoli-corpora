00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:32.238
And so now we can start to program
exactly an interaction,

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.356
a rule of engagement between neighbors.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:36.607
And once we have this system,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.047
we can start to program many
different kinds of rules of engagement

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:41.577
that you would see in nature.

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:44.577
So for example,
spontaneous synchronization,

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:49.839
how audiences are clapping
and suddenly start all clapping together,

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.931
the fireflies flashing together.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.610
We can program rules
for pattern formation,

00:03:57.634 --> 00:03:59.420
how cells in a tissue

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.546
determine what role
they're going to take on
