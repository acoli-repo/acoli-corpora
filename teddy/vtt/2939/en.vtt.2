00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.594
what I've worked on for most of my career.

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:05.437
I'm a computer scientist,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.208
and the field that I work in
is artificial intelligence.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.156
And a key theme in AI

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.623
is being able to understand intelligence
by creating our own computational systems

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:17.900
that display intelligence
the way we see it in nature.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:22.905
Now, most popular views of AI, of course,
come from science fiction and the movies,

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.506
and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.390
But that tends to be a very human-centric
view of intelligence.
