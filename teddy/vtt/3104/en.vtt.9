00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:30.883
with a green Afghan traditional coat

00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:34.696
and an American Boy Scout shirt --

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.972
a culture clash that works.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.032
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5,"

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:44.537
I wore a macaroni wig,

00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:50.129
inspired by eighteenth-century
macaroni headgear from England.

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:55.110
This was paired with
a British Norfolk jacket,

00:04:55.903 --> 00:04:58.867
Yoruba Nigerian trousers,

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.547
and, improbably, a South African
Zulu fighting stick.
