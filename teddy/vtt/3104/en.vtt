In 1996, I was commissioned
by the Guggenheim Museum

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:12.389
to execute a large body of work
called "Uses of Evidence."

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.894
It was a cube --

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:17.997

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.529
Each side had a window

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:24.953
in order for the spectators
to view the interior of the structure.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.045
The exterior of the structure
was a collage of Africa and Africans
