00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:02.839
I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover

00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:09.331
with imagery totally unexpected,
yet profoundly reasonable.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:14.121
The "Cover Girl" series
proposed a different way

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:20.169
the African can be represented
in a more complex manner.

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.160
Like "Cover Girl,"
the "Sartorial Anarchy" series

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:29.490
is made up of self-portraits.
