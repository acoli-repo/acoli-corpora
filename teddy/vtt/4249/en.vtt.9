00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.855
at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers --

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.250
and the scientists,
geologists always tell me

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.401
that the real interesting science,
the science-rich sites,

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:38.936
are always at the cliffs.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.910
But the current rovers cannot get there.

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:43.417
So, inspired by that,
we wanted to build a robot

00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.558
that can climb
a structured cliff environment.

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:47.806
So this is CLIMBeR.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.341
It has three legs.

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:52.948
It's probably difficult to see, but it has
a winch and a cable at the top.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.553
It tries to figure out
the best place to put its foot.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.212
And then once it figures that out,

00:04:57.236 --> 00:05:00.213
in real time, it calculates
the force distribution:
