DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.

00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:04.989
Last year, it actually conducted
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:07.401
for the holiday concert.

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:10.401
This is the next generation
robot, DARwIn IV,

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.401
much smarter, faster, stronger.

00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:15.402
And it's trying to show off its ability:

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.223
"I'm macho, I'm strong."

00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:18.691
(Laughter)

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:22.940
"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,
martial art movements."

00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:24.976
(Laughter)

00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:28.360
And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.

00:11:28.384 --> 00:11:30.519
Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby.
