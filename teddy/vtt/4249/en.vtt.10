WEBVTT

00:04:57.236 --> 00:05:00.213
in real time, it calculates
the force distribution:

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:02.760
how much force it needs
to exert to the surface

00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:04.761
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.926
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.253
and then with the winch,
it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.

00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:13.401
Also for search and rescue
applications as well.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:15.844
Five years ago,
I actually worked at NASA JPL

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:17.718
during the summer as a faculty fellow.

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:21.192
And they already had
a six-legged robot called LEMUR.

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.856
So this is actually based on that.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.171
This robot is called MARS:

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.812
Multi-Appendage Robotic System.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:27.074
It's a hexapod robot.

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.075
We developed our adaptive gait planner.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.624
We actually have a very interesting
payload on there.
