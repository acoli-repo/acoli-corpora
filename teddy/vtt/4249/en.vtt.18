00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.259
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.

00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:02.594
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:05.975
However, still, as you can see,
it has a cord, an umbilical cord.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.171
So we're still using
an external power source

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:09.794
and external computation.

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:14.053
So in 2006, now it's really
time to have fun.

00:09:14.077 --> 00:09:15.536
Let's give it intelligence.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.681
We give it all the computing
power it needs:

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:20.235
a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
two FireWire cameras,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:23.105
rate gyros, accelerometers,
four forced sensors on the foot,

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.479
lithium polymer batteries --

00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:27.653
and now DARwIn II
is completely autonomous.

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:30.837
It is not remote controlled.
There's no tethers.
