00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.624
We actually have a very interesting
payload on there.

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:33.095
The students like to have fun.

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.214
And here you can see that it's walking
over unstructured terrain.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:37.355
(Motor sound)

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.176
It's trying to walk
on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.848
but depending on the moisture content
or the grain size of the sand,

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:48.716
the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
so it tries to adapt its gait

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.980
to successfully cross
over these kind of things.

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:52.511
It also does some fun stuff.

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:56.020
As you can imagine,
we get so many visitors visiting our lab.

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.776
So when the visitors come,
MARS walks up to the computer,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.848
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.
