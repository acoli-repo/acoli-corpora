00:07:56.642 --> 00:08:00.181
It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:01.943
to operate this complex arm.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.934
In this case, it's very intuitive;

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.226
this student, probably
his first time using it,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.228
is doing very complex manipulation tasks,

00:08:08.252 --> 00:08:11.613
picking up objects and doing
manipulation, just like that.

00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:12.842
Very intuitive.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.362
Now, this robot
is currently our star robot.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:20.371
We actually have a fan club
for the robot, DARwIn:

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:23.296
Dynamic Anthropomorphic
Robot with Intelligence.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.203
As you know, we're very interested
in human walking,

00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:29.419
so we decided to build
a small humanoid robot.

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:31.205
This was in 2004; at that time,
