00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.910
and I have this eureka moment.

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:03.450
I directly run to my home office,
sit at my computer,

00:13:03.474 --> 00:13:05.451
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out

00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:07.366
and I keep a database of ideas.

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.389
So when we have these calls for proposals,

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:13.983
I try to find a match
between my potential ideas

00:13:14.007 --> 00:13:15.167
and the problem.

00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.508
If there's a match,
we write a research proposal,

00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:18.879
get the research funding in,

00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:21.063
and that's how we start
our research programs.

00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:23.580
But just a spark of imagination
is not good enough.

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:25.484
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:28.288
At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
and Mechanisms Laboratory,

00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.924
we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions.
