00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.955
And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.688
and coordinates it so it can show
this very impressive mobility.

00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:39.353
You probably haven't seen
anything like this out there.

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:43.047
This is a very high-mobility robot
that we developed called IMPASS.

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:46.401
Ah, isn't that cool?

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.719
When you drive your car,

00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:53.665
when you steer your car, you use
a method called Ackermann steering.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.540
The front wheels rotate like this.

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.079
For most small-wheeled robots,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.352
they use a method
called differential steering
