00:12:29.802 --> 00:12:32.158
with a special pen
that has an LED light on it,

00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:35.219
because I don't want to turn on the light
and wake up my wife.

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:38.512
So I see this, scribble everything down,
draw things, and go to bed.

00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:40.926
Every day in the morning,
the first thing I do,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.557
before my first cup of coffee,
before I brush my teeth,

00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:44.743
I open my notebook.

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:47.430
Many times it's empty;
sometimes I have something there.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:49.520
If something's there, sometimes it's junk.

00:12:49.544 --> 00:12:51.901
But most of the time,
I can't read my handwriting.

00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:54.249
Four in the morning --
what do you expect, right?

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:56.177
So I need to decipher what I wrote.

00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.401
But sometimes I see
this ingenious idea in there,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.910
and I have this eureka moment.
