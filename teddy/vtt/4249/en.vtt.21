DH: There you go. Yes!

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:37.473
The robots track and they team-play
amongst themselves.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:39.085
It's very impressive.

00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:40.585
It's really a research event,

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:44.849
packaged in a more exciting
competition event.

00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:48.401
What you see here is the beautiful
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.

00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:49.944
This is for the best humanoid.

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:53.637
We'd like to bring this, for the first

00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:54.816
so wish us luck.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.876

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.052

00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:01.249
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.
