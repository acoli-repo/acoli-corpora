00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:31.205
This was in 2004; at that time,

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:33.499
this was something really,
really revolutionary.

00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:35.324
This was more of a feasibility study:

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.999
What kind of motors should we use?
Is it even possible?

00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:39.757
What kinds of controls should we do?

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:43.301
This does not have any sensors,
so it's an open-loop control.

00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:46.095
For those who probably know,
if you don't have any sensors

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:48.692
and there's any disturbances,
you know what happens.

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:50.829
(Laughter)

00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:56.077
Based on that success, the following year
we did the proper mechanical design,

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.325
starting from kinematics.

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.259
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
