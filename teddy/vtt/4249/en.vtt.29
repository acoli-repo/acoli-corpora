00:14:29.662 --> 00:14:32.678
and creativity
and good engineering intuition.

00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:34.496
If you want to go beyond a tinkering,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.670
if you want to go
beyond a hobby of robotics

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:40.135
and really tackle
the grand challenges of robotics

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.401
through rigorous research,

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:42.580
we need more than that.

00:14:42.604 --> 00:14:44.618
This is where school comes in.

00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:47.136
Batman, fighting against the bad guys,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.553
he has his utility belt,
he has his grappling hook,

00:14:49.577 --> 00:14:51.401
he has all different kinds of gadgets.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.838
For us roboticists,
engineers and scientists,

00:14:53.862 --> 00:14:58.019
these tools are the courses
and classes you take in class.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.045
Math, differential equations.
