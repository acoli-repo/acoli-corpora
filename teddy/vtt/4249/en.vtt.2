00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.996
What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.476
stand up again, swing your leg
and catch the fall.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.667
You're using your built-in dynamics,
the physics of your body,

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.442
just like a pendulum.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.824
We call that the concept
of passive dynamic locomotion.

00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:15.986
What you're doing is, when you stand up,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.091
potential energy to kinetic energy,

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.092
potential energy to kinetic energy.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.093
It's a constantly falling process.

00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:25.166
So even though there is nothing
in nature that looks like this,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.319
really, we're inspired by biology
and applying the principles of walking

00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:30.500
to this robot.
