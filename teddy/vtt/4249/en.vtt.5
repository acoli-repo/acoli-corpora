It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down,

00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:32.575
so we still have a lot of work to do.

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.121
The second robot I want
to talk about is called IMPASS.

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:40.604
It stands for Intelligent Mobility
Platform with Actuated Spoke System.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.223
It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:47.104
So think of a rimless wheel
or a spoke wheel,

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:50.105
but the spokes individually
move in and out of the hub;

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.216
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.482
We're literally reinventing
the wheel here.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.969
Let me demonstrate how it works.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.842
So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach.
