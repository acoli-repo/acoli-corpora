00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:30.500
to this robot.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.501
Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.938
What you see here,
this is what we want to do next.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:38.476
We want to fold up the legs
and shoot it up for long-range motion.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.294
And it deploys legs --
it looks almost like "Star Wars" --

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:44.182
so when it lands, it absorbs
the shock and starts walking.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.411
What you see over here, this yellow thing,
this is not a death ray.

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:48.447
(Laughter)

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.630
This is just to show you

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:52.341
that if you have cameras
or different types of sensors,

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:53.882
because it's 1.8 meters tall,

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:56.992
you can see over obstacles like bushes
and those kinds of things.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.363
So we have two prototypes.

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.330
The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I.
