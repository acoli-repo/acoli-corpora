00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:30.014
And what you see over here
is a very popular video game,

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.738
and in this fiction, they describe
these alien creatures and robots

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.024
that have three legs that terrorize Earth.

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:39.583
But my robot, STriDER,
does not move like this.

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:42.658
This is an actual dynamic
simulation animation.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.739
I'm going to show you how the robot works.

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:47.155
It flips its body 180 degrees

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.237
and it swings its leg between the two legs

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.420
and catches the fall.

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.606
So that's how it walks.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.342
But when you look at us
human beings, bipedal walking,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.524
what you're doing is,

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:59.635
you're not really using muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.996
What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall,
