00:11:28.384 --> 00:11:30.519
Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby.

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:33.735
We truly believe this will be
the very first running humanoid robot

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.910
in the United States.

00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.088
So stay tuned.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.113
All right. So I showed you
some of our exciting robots at work.

00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:41.325
So, what is the secret of our success?

00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:43.166
Where do we come up with these ideas?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.083
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:11:45.107 --> 00:11:46.897
We have a fully autonomous vehicle

00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:48.797
that can drive into urban environments.

00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.720
We won a half a million dollars
in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.401
We also have the world's very first
vehicle that can be driven by the blind.

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.949
We call it the Blind Driver
Challenge, very exciting.

00:11:57.973 --> 00:12:01.145
And many, many other robotics
projects I want to talk about.
