00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.330
The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.521
The one in front,
the smaller, is STriDER II.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:07.053
The problem we had with STriDER I is,
it was just too heavy in the body.

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:09.661
We had so many motors aligning the joints

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:10.939
and those kinds of things.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.163
So we decided to synthesize
a mechanical mechanism

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.256
so we could get rid of all the motors,
and with a single motor,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.957
we can coordinate all the motions.

00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.358
It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
instead of using mechatronics.

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:25.794
So with this, now the top body
is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:27.877
This was the very first successful step.

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.569
It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down,
