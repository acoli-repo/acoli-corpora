00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.352
they use a method
called differential steering

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:03.233
where the left and right wheel
turn the opposite direction.

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:06.155
For IMPASS, we can do many,
many different types of motion.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.448
For example, in this case,

00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:09.872
even though the left and right
wheels are connected

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:12.662
with a single axle rotating
at the same angle of velocity,

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.820
we simply change the length
of the spoke, it affects the diameter,

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.931
then can turn to the left
and to the right.

00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:21.308
These are just some examples
of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.

00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:23.106
This robot is called CLIMBeR:

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.530
Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
Matching Behavior Robot.

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:29.681
I've been talking
to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.855
at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers --
