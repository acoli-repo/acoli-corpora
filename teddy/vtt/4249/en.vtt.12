00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.848
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:02.401
Welcome to RoMeLa,

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:05.038
the Robotics Mechanisms
Laboratory at Virginia Tech."

00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:06.532
(Laughter)

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:08.681
This robot is an amoeba robot.

00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:11.593
Now, we don't have enough time
to go into technical details,

00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:13.674
I'll just show you
some of the experiments.

00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:16.210
These are some of the early
feasibility experiments.

00:06:16.234 --> 00:06:19.319
We store potential energy
to the elastic skin to make it move,

00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:23.146
or use active tension cords
to make it move forward and backward.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.327
It's called ChIMERA.

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.363
We also have been working
with some scientists and engineers

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.538
from UPenn

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.395
to come up with a chemically actuated
version of this amoeba robot.
