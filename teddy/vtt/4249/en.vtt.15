00:07:28.678 --> 00:07:30.046
that we call HyDRAS,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.781
Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
Articulated Serpentine.

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:34.976
This is a robot that can climb structures.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.083
This is a HyDRAS's arm.

00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:39.116
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.488
But the cool part is the user interface.

00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:44.255
The cable over there,
that's an optical fiber.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.715
This student, it's probably
her first time using it,

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:49.096
but she can articulate it
in many different ways.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.583
So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
there are roadside bombs.

00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:56.618
Currently, you send these remotely
controlled vehicles that are armed.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:08:00.181
It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator
