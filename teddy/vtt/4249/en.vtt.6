00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.842
So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:03.843
Just simply using
the tactile sensors on the feet,

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.677
it's trying to walk
over a changing terrain,

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.401
a soft terrain where it pushes
down and changes.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.622
And just by the tactile information,

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.401
it successfully crosses
over these types of terrains.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:18.230
But, when it encounters
a very extreme terrain --

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:22.167
in this case, this obstacle
is more than three times the height

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:23.361
of the robot --

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.259
then it switches to a deliberate mode,

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:28.097
where it uses a laser range finder
and camera systems

00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.947
to identify the obstacle and the size.

00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.955
And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes
