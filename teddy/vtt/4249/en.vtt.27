00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.924
we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions.

00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:35.283
So we gather around, we discuss problems
and solutions and talk about it.

00:13:35.307 --> 00:13:38.284
But before we start,
we set this golden rule.

00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:39.957
The rule is:

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:42.958
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.

00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:44.987
Nobody criticizes any opinion.

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:48.972
This is important, because many times,
students fear or feel uncomfortable

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:52.265
about how others might think
about their opinions and thoughts.

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:56.079
So once you do this, it is amazing
how the students open up.

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:59.401
They have these wacky, cool,
crazy, brilliant ideas,

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:02.854
and the whole room is just electrified
with creative energy.
