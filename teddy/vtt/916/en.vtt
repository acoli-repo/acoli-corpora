00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.976
We're going to go on a dive
to the deep sea,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.976
and anyone that's had
that lovely opportunity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.681
knows that for about
two and half hours on the way down,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.400
it's a perfectly positively
pitch-black world.

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:15.416
And we used to see the most mysterious
animals out the window

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.803
that you couldn't describe:

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:20.426
these blinking lights -- a world
of bioluminescence, like fireflies.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.583
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean
Research and Conservation Association --

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.366
was able to come up with a camera

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.876
that could capture some
of these incredible animals,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.276
and that's what you're seeing
here on the screen.
