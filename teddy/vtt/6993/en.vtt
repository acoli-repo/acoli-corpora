Hi, Ted, talk daily listener.

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:08.913
So we've been sharing podcasts from
the TED audio collected for

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:13.829
the last nine Fridays now and now, we
thought we'd have a little bit of fun.

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:17.371
You're about to hear another great
episode of a TED podcast,

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.913
but I can't tell you which one.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.079
We're randomly serving different episodes
to our global audience.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:27.663
You can check back in later
or on a different app

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:29.038
and you might get something different.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.537
I can promise what you'll hear
will be true to Ted,
