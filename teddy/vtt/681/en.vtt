00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:02.686
I'm a marine biologist

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.845
here to talk to you
about the crisis in our oceans,

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:09.847
but this time perhaps not
with a message you've heard before,

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.165
because I want to tell you
that if the survival of the oceans

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.775
depended only on people like me,

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:20.021
scientists trading in publications,

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:22.791
we'd be in even worse trouble than we are.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.716
Because, as a scientist,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.104
the most important things
that I've learned

00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:30.608
about keeping our oceans
healthy and productive
