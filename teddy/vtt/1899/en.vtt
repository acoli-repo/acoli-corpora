Over the past couple of days,

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:04.134
as I've been preparing for my speech,

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.698
I've become more and more nervous
about what I'm going to say

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.841
and about being on the same stage
as all these fascinating people.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:15.155
Being on the same stage as Al Gore,
who was the first person I ever voted for.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.339
And --

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:19.976
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.790
So I was getting pretty nervous

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:24.619
and, you know, I didn't know
that Chris sits on the stage,

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:26.127
and that's more nerve-racking.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.207
But then I started thinking
about my family.

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.976
I started thinking about my father
and my grandfather
