00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.220
trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.781
And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth,

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:41.324
the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches.

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:45.101
This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,”

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.240
is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.864
even in perfect growing conditions.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.557
And using this model alongside 
growth rates

00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:57.320
and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.436
researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species.
