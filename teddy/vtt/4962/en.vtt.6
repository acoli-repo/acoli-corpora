00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.383
the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure,

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.233
pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:09.563
Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights,

00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:13.658
distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize –

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:15.864
far above the tree’s roots.

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:18.499
But despite these sophisticated systems,

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.560
every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.719
As trees grow taller and taller,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.757
the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:27.990
At a certain height,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.220
trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis.
