00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.794
trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies –

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:06.750
carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.082
The first is phloem sap.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:12.667
Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.394
phloem sap is thick, like honey,

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:20.327
and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:21.658
By the end of its journey,

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:25.061
the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance,

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.552
pooling at the base of the tree.

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:31.789
Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem.
