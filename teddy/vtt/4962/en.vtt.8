00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.436
researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species.

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.502
So far these limits have held up –

00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:08.614
even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:12.678
Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit,

00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:16.797
and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.132
But until we learn more,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:21.368
the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity,

00:04:21.368 --> 00:04:25.208
literally, shapes life on Earth.
