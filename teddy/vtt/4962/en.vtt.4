00:01:56.306 --> 00:02:00.585
which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.504
But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity.

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:09.529
To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces:

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.766
transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:19.086
As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:23.866
These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf,

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:28.109
but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.926
This evaporation, called transpiration,
