00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.926
This evaporation, called transpiration,

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:36.476
creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:42.025
This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.431
In narrow tubes,

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.618
the attraction between water molecules

00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:50.828
and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity.

00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:54.528
This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.772
thinner than human hair.

00:02:56.772 --> 00:02:59.460
And where these two forces pull the sap,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.383
the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure,
