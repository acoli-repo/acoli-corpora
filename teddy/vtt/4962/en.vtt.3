00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:31.789
Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.471
This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron,

00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:40.155
which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:41.666
Here at the tree’s base,

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.958
there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other,

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.774
so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.865
to correct the balance.

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:53.707
This process, called osmotic movement,

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.306
creates nutrient-rich xylem sap,

00:01:56.306 --> 00:02:00.585
which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree.
