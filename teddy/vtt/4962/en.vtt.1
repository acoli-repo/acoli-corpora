No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters –

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:36.289
and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.254
even if they live for thousands of 
years to come.

00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:43.809
So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever?

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.241
It all comes down to sap.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.800
In order for trees to grow,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.964
they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:55.368
and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening.

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.233
And just like blood circulates in 
the human body,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.794
trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies –
