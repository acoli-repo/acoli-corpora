You may have heard
about the Koran's idea of paradise

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:06.851
being 72 virgins,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.828
and I promise I will come back
to those virgins.

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.806
But in fact, here in the Northwest,
we're living very close

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.433
to the real Koranic idea of paradise,

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:21.102
defined 36 times as "gardens
watered by running streams."

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.137
Since I live on a houseboat
on the running stream of Lake Union,

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.383
this makes perfect sense to me.

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:31.407
But the thing is, how come
it's news to most people?
