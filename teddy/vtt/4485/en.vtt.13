00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:32.583
(Laughter)

00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:35.370
This was perhaps the biggest surprise --

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:37.476
how flexible the Koran is,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.185
at least in minds that are not
fundamentally inflexible.

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:46.043
"Some of these verses
are definite in meaning," it says,

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.936
"and others are ambiguous."

00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:52.683
The perverse at heart
will seek out the ambiguities,

00:06:52.707 --> 00:06:57.336
trying to create discord
by pinning down meanings of their own.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.650
Only God knows the true meaning.
