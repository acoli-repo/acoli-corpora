that the Koran can be read
as we usually read a book --

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.476
as though we can curl up
with it on a rainy afternoon

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.476
with a bowl of popcorn within reach,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020
as though God --

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.786
and the Koran is entirely in the voice
of God speaking to Muhammad --

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.604
were just another author
on the best-seller list.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:21.728
Yet, the fact that so few people
do actually read the Koran

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:27.014
is precisely why it's so easy to quote --
that is, to misquote.

00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:28.062
(Laughter)
