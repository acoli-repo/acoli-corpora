00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.311
because it turned out to be three months.

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.222
(Laughter)

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.744

to skip to the back,

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.935
where the shorter and more
clearly mystical chapters are.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.476
But every time I thought I was beginning
to get a handle on the Koran --

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.782

00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:18.547

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.555

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.180
The Koran declares that it comes
to renew the message

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:29.637
of the Torah and the Gospels.

00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:33.149

the stories of Biblical figures
