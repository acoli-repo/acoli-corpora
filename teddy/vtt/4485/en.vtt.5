00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:31.476
I knew enough, that is, to know
that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.476
an informed one,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.975
an experienced one, even,

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.348
but still an outsider,

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:41.194
an agnostic Jew reading
someone else's holy book.

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:43.293
(Laughter)

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.887
So I read slowly.

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.396
(Laughter)

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.907
I'd set aside three weeks
for this project,

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.801
and that, I think,
is what is meant by "hubris" --

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:59.111
(Laughter)

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.311
because it turned out to be three months.
