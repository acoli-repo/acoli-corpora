That idea only came
into being 300 years later,

00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:36.263
and most Islamic scholars
see it as the equivalent

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:39.889
of people with wings sitting on clouds
and strumming harps.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.978
Paradise is quite the opposite.

00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:46.614
It's not virginity;

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.122
it's fecundity;

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.204
it's plenty.

00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:54.605
It's gardens watered by running streams.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.412
Thank you.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:04.413
