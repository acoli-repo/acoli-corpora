00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.476
the Koran includes women --

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.924
talking, for instance,

00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:36.372
of believing men and believing women,

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:39.584
honorable men and honorable women.

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:44.961
Or take the infamous verse
about killing the unbelievers.

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:47.476
Yes, it does say that,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.226
but in a very specific context:

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.587
the anticipated conquest
of the sanctuary city of Mecca,

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.135
where fighting was usually forbidden.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.682
And the permission comes
hedged about with qualifiers.
