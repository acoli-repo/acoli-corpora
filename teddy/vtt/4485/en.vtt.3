Phrases and snippets taken out of context

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.576
in what I call the "highlighter version,"

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.687
which is the one favored
by both Muslim fundamentalists

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.476
and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:40.822
So this past spring,

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:44.908
as I was gearing up to begin writing
a biography of Muhammad,

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:49.166
I realized I needed to read
the Koran properly --

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.952
as properly as I could, that is.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:55.086
My Arabic is reduced by now
to wielding a dictionary,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.476
so I took four well-known translations

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.665
and decided to read them
side by side, verse by verse,
