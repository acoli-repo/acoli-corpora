It's just 29 words in Arabic,

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.902
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.

almost hypnotic quality

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.758

00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:50.552
felt more than analyzed.

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.304
It wants to be chanted out loud,

00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:56.112
to sound its music in the ear
and on the tongue.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.476
So the Koran in English
is a kind of shadow of itself,
