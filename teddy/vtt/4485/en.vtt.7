God himself was utterly familiar

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.476

jealously insisting on no other gods.

00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:53.702
The presence of camels, mountains,
desert wells and springs

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:57.157
took me back to the year I spent
wandering the Sinai Desert.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:01.476

the rhythmic cadence of it,
