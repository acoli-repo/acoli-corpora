00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.476
So the Koran in English
is a kind of shadow of itself,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.331
or as Arthur Arberry called his version,

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:05.703

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.476
As the Koran promises,
patience is rewarded,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.049
and there are many surprises --

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:18.229

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:21.822
and of humans as mere stewards
of God's creation,

00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:23.480
unmatched in the Bible.

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.226
And where the Bible is addressed
exclusively to men,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.876

and third-person masculine,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.476
the Koran includes women --
