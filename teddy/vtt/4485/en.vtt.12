00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.682
And the permission comes
hedged about with qualifiers.

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:03.476
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.739
but you can, you are allowed to,

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:10.134
but only after a grace period is over,

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.016
and only if there's no other
pact in place,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.476
and only if they try to stop
you getting to the Kaaba,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.216
and only if they attack you first.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.845
And even then -- God is merciful;

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:24.898
forgiveness is supreme --

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:27.640
and so, essentially,

00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:29.117
better if you don't.

00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:32.583
(Laughter)
