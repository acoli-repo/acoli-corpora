00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.993
The phrase "God is subtle"
appears again and again,

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:07.619
and indeed, the whole
of the Koran is far more subtle

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:10.147
than most of us have been led to believe.

00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:15.239
As in, for instance, that little matter
of virgins and paradise.

00:07:16.444 --> 00:07:19.615
Old-fashioned orientalism
comes into play here.

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:25.169
The word used four times is "houris,"

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:29.650
rendered as dark-eyed maidens
with swelling breasts,

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:32.867
or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
