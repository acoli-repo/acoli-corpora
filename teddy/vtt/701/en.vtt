About a year and a half ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on redefining the way maps work online.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we really are seeing this in very different terms

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from the kind of mapping and direction site

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that one is used to.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,
