00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I still remember the day in school

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when our teacher told us

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and into the future,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Instead, I have progressed,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
