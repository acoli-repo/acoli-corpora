Hi. So, this chap here,

00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:05.718
he thinks he can tell you the future.

00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:07.697
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:11.367
made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.270
And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.378
that people can see into the future.

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:18.082
I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:21.264
you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.323
and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.938
hear about the flukes and about the freaks.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:31.017
We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.
