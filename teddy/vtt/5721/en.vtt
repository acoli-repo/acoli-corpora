What do you want to create?

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:05.630
Where do you share this with others,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.963
and how do you want them to feel?

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:09.130
As a brand designer,

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:11.063
I ask a lot of questions

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.097
and practice empathy
to understand from people

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:18.030
their personalities and motivations
behind the why of what they do

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:20.597
to help them express themselves,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.197
sometimes transforming
ugly moments into unique ones,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.530
or turning something ordinary
into something memorable.
