Oakland Avenue Farms is transforming
into a five-acre landscape

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.256
combining art, architecture,
sustainable ecologies

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.336
and new market practices.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.096
In the truest sense of the word,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.360
this is what agriculture
looks like in the city of Detroit.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.656
I've had the opportunity
to work with Oakland Avenue Farms

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.840
in hosting Detroit-grown and made
farm-to-table dinners.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.496
These are dinners
where we bring folks onto the farm,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.976
we give them plenty
of time and opportunity

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.096
to meet and greet and talk to the grower,
