to meet and greet and talk to the grower,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.296
and then they're taken on a farm tour.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.096
And then afterwards,
they're treated to a farm-to-table meal

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.056
prepared by a chef

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.880
who showcases all the produce on the farm
right at the peak of its freshness.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.536
We do that.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.456
We bring people onto the farm,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.696
we have folks sitting around a table,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.056
because we want to change
people's relationship to food.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.336
We want them to know
exactly where their food comes from
