where they have to shop for food

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.200
than they do a full-service supermarket.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680
And this is not good news
about the city of Detroit,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.176
but this is the news

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.576
and the story

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.576
that Detroiters intend to change.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.250

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.336
This is the story
that Detroiters are changing,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.120
through urban agriculture
and food entrepreneurship.
