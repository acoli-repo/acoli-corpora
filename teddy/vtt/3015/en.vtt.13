00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.656
they were able to clean up the grounds

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.496
and they transformed that building
into a community kitchen,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.296
into a cafe, into a storefront.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.096
Now the farmers and the food artisans
who live in Brightmoor,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.216
they have a place where they
can make and sell their product.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.776
And the people in the community

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.840
have some place where they can buy
healthy, fresh food.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.336
Urban agriculture --
and this is my third example --

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.360
can be used as a way to lift up
the business cooperative model.
