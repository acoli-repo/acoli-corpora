00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.280
that 40 square miles
of the city is vacant.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.896
That's a quarter to a third of the city,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.696
and with that level of emptiness,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.280
it creates a landscape
unlike any other big city.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.016
So Detroit has this --
open land, fertile soil,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.056
proximity to water,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.856
willing labor

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.480
and a desperate demand
for healthy, fresh food.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.016
All of this has created
a people-powered grassroots movement
