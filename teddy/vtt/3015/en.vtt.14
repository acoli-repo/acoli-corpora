can be used as a way to lift up
the business cooperative model.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.976
The 1,500 farms and gardens
I told you about earlier?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.256
Keep Growing Detroit
is a nonprofit organization

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.640
that had a lot to do with those farms.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.776
They distributed last year
70,000 packets of seeds

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.336
and a quarter of a million transplants,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.416
and as a result of that last year,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.336
550,000 pounds of produce

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.616
was grown in the city of Detroit.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.400
