00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.616
gardens and farms
located all across the city today.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.176
And these aren't plots of land

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.000
where we're just growing
tomatoes and carrots either.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.136
You understand, urban agriculture
in Detroit is all about community,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.016
because we grow together.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.416
So these spaces
are spaces of conviviality.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.416
These spaces are places
where we're building social cohesion

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.816
as well as providing healthy, fresh food

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.176
to our friends, our families
and our neighbors.
