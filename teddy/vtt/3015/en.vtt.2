more specifically, fresh food retail,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.576
resulting in a city
where 70 percent of Detroiters

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240
are obese and overweight,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.440
and they struggle.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.400
They struggle to access
nutritious food that they need,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.856
that they need to stay healthy,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.776
that they need to prevent premature
illness and diet-related diseases.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.496
Far too many Detroiters
live closer to a fast food restaurant

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.816
or to a convenience store,
or to a gas station
