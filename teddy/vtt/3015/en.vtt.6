00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.016
All of this has created
a people-powered grassroots movement

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.576
of people in Detroit

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.736
who are transforming this city

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.800
from what was the capital
of American industry

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.520
into an agrarian paradise.

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:11.456
(Applause)

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.536
You know, I think,
out of all the cities in the world,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.336
Detroit, Michigan, is best positioned
to serve as the world's urban exemplar

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.896
of food security
and sustainable development.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.936
In Detroit, we have over 1,500, yes, 1,500

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.616
gardens and farms
located all across the city today.
