00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.336
We want them to know
exactly where their food comes from

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.176
that is grown on that farm
that's on the plate.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.776
My second stop,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.456
I'm going to take you
on the west side of Detroit,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.256
to the Brightmoor neighborhood.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.000
Now, Brightmoor is
a lower-income community in Detroit.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.480
There's about 13,000
residents in Brightmoor.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.256
They decided to take
a block-by-block-by-block strategy.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.776
So within the neighborhood of Brightmoor,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.680
you'll find a 21-block microneighborhood
called Brightmoor Farmway.
