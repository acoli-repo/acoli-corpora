00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.320
that have been historically excluded
from these types of opportunities.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.040
I know, I know.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.240
My city is a long way from succeeding.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.456
We're still struggling,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.296
and I'm not going to stand here
on this stage and tell you

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.736
that all of Detroit's problems
and all of Detroit's challenges

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.696
are going to be solved
through urban agriculture.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.376
I'm not going to do that,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.496
but I will tell you this:

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.896
urban agriculture
has Detroit thinking about its city

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.496
now in a different way,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.360
a city that can be both urban and rural.
