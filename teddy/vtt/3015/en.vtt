00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.200
I'm from Detroit.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.896
(Applause)

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.920
A city that in the 1950s
was the world's industrial giant,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.496
with a population of 1.8 million people

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.096
and 140 square miles
of land and infrastructure,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.840
used to support this booming,
Midwestern urban center.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.136
And now today,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.880
just a half a century later,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.280
Detroit is the poster child
for urban decay.
