One in seven people around the world
has some kind of disability.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:07.420
Being born without my right hand
has defined who I am

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.338
over the past 30 years.

to see me driving my bike

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:18.598
or probably playing basketball.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.606
when Luke's hand gets cut off,

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:28.107
the same one I didn't have.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.193
But then, being twice as stunned
