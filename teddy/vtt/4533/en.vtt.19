00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Our message today, and our purpose today,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and those of you who are here today,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000
because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We know it all.
