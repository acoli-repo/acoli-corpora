00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
