00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The angels prostrate, not before the human body,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but before the human soul.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Why? Because the soul, the human soul,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
embodies a piece of the divine breath,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
a piece of the divine soul.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
What is the imagery of God?
