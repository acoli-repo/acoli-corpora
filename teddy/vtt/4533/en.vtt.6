refer to teachings and examples of our prophet

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that teach us where the source of our problems lies.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In one of the battles that the prophet waged,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to the greater war, to the greater battle."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
How can we go to a greater battle?"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."
