00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
as we might say in English.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The voice says, "Go away."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
he comes back.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The voice asks, "Who is there?"

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."
