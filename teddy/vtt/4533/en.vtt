I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as being one that is grounded in compassion.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The truth of the matter is otherwise.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
