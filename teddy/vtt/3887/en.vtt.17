00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:31.652
When I was looking through
my London journal and scrapbook

00:08:31.652 --> 00:08:34.902
from my London semester
abroad 16 years ago,

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:40.396
I came across this modified quote
from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."

00:08:41.547 --> 00:08:45.841
"There are more scary things
inside than outside."

00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:49.099
And then I wrote a note
to myself at the bottom:

00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:50.983
"Remember this."

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:56.685
I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself
to get out and explore London,

00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:03.758
but the message I missed was the need 
to start exploring and embracing myself.
