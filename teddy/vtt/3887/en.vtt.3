Hiding is a progressive habit,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.948
and once you start hiding,

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:38.953
it becomes harder and harder
to step forward and speak out.

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:41.822
In fact, even now,

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:45.697
when I was talking to people
about what this talk was about,

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.533
I made up a cover story

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.348
and I even hid the truth
about my TED Talk.

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:57.329
So it is fitting and scary

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.519
that I have returned 
to this city 16 years later
