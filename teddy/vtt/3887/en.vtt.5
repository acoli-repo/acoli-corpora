Thank you.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.397
I've struggled to say those words,

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:41.573
because I didn't want
to be defined by them.

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.202
Every time I would think
about coming out in the past,

00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:49.266
I would think to myself,
but I just want to be known as Morgana,

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.430
uniquely Morgana,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.439
but not "my lesbian friend Morgana,"
or "my gay coworker Morgana."

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.893
Just Morgana.

00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:02.302
For those of you from large
metropolitan areas,
