When I was young,
I prided myself as a nonconformist

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:10.429
in the conservative
U.S. state I live in, Kansas.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.742
I didn't follow along with the crowd.

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:16.173
I wasn't afraid to try
weird clothing trends or hairstyles.

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:19.762
I was outspoken and extremely social.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:26.093
Even these pictures and postcards 
of my London semester abroad 16 years ago

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:32.097
show that I obviously didn't care
if I was perceived as weird or different.
