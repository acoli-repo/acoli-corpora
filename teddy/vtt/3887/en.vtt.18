00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:03.758
but the message I missed was the need 
to start exploring and embracing myself.

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:07.465
What I didn't realize
until all these years later

00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:12.371
is that the biggest obstacles
I will ever have to overcome

00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:16.438
are my own fears and insecurities.

00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:23.876
I believe that by facing my fears inside,
I will be able to change reality outside.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.791
I made a choice today

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:34.333
to reveal a part of myself
that I have hidden for too long.
