But that same year 
I was in London, 16 years ago,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.699
I realized something about myself
that actually was somewhat unique,

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.059
and that changed everything.

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:53.079

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.005

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.385

and leadership activities.
