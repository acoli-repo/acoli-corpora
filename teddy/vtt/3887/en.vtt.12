In February, the Kansas House of 
Representatives brought up a bill for vote

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:04.147
that would have essentially
allowed businesses

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:10.745
to use religious freedom as a reason
to deny gays services.

00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:16.245
A former coworker and friend of mine

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:21.068
has a father who serves
in the Kansas House of Representatives.

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:26.246
He voted in favor of the bill,

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:33.007
in favor of a law that would allow 
businesses to not serve me.
