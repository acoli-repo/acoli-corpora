00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:03.734
When, in 1960, still a student,

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.159
I got a traveling fellowship

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.220
to study housing in North America.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.504
We traveled the country.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:14.609
We saw public housing high-rise buildings

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.950
in all major cities:

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.030
New York, Philadelphia.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.999
Those who have no choice lived there.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.294
And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.342
and I came back thinking,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.996
we've got to reinvent the apartment building.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.675
There has to be another way of doing this.
