00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.287
with a few curtains or sheets.

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:37.459
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.382
and people create a space out of any found objects

00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:42.271
or materials.

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:44.771
It's remarkable to see the design decisions

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.447

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:51.347

00:04:51.347 --> 00:04:55.208
with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper

00:04:55.208 --> 00:05:00.260
just to make it a kind of clean finish.
