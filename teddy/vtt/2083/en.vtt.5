00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.329
The building was under construction

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.855
until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:36.221
and the death of the developer in the early '90s.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.183
About eight years ago, people started moving

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.196
into the abandoned tower

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:43.215
and began to build their homes right in between

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.414
every column of this unfinished tower.

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:49.211
There's only one little entrance to the entire building,

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.149
and the 3,000 residents come in and out

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.217
through that single door.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:57.106
Together, the inhabitants created public spaces

00:02:57.106 --> 00:02:59.379
and designed them to feel more like a home

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.974
and less like an unfinished tower.
