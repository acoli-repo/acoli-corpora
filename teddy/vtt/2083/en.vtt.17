00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:31.841
With this entire village existing on the water,

00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:34.264
public space is very limited,

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.928
so now that the school is finished,

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:39.302
the ground floor is a playground for the kids,

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:41.169
but when classes are out, the platform

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.740
is just like a town square,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.135
where the fishermen mend their nets

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:49.300
and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.830
Another place I'd like to share with you

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.878
is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.

00:08:53.878 --> 00:08:56.637
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:59.107
from the upper Egypt in the '40s,

00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:00.533
and today they make their living
