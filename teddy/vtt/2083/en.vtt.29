which sit seven meters below the ground.

00:14:30.107 --> 00:14:32.095
When I asked people why they were digging

00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:33.984
their houses from the ground,

00:14:33.984 --> 00:14:36.007

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:38.187
and apple farmers who didn't have the money

00:14:38.187 --> 00:14:41.588
to buy materials, and this digging out

00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:46.056

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:55.731
and neighborhoods in ways that respond

00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.641
specifically to their environment and circumstances.

00:14:59.641 --> 00:15:01.872
Created by these very people who live,
