00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:03.616
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:06.299
there lived until recently an estimated

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:10.168
40 million people in these houses underground.

00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:12.619
These dwellings are called the yaodongs.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.809
Through this architecture by subtraction,

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:18.396
these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:22.270
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.016
and hidden behind these mounds of dirt

00:14:25.016 --> 00:14:27.516
are these square, rectangular houses

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:30.107
which sit seven meters below the ground.
