There are the retail shops, the cafes

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.286
and the restaurants, and the community

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:20.227

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:25.911
along with the scores of religious iconographies

00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:27.669
throughout the area,

00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:30.858
and also all the everyday services
