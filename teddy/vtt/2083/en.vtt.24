00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:01.182
Every apartment is unique,

00:12:01.182 --> 00:12:02.975
and this individuality tells a story

00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:06.101
about each family's circumstances and values.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.247
Many of these people take their homes

00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:11.415
and interior spaces very seriously,

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:12.922
putting a lot of work and care

00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:14.248
into the details.

00:12:14.248 --> 00:12:17.421
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,

00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:21.278
where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.

00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:24.261
But despite this elaborate decor,

00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:26.815
sometimes these apartments are used

00:12:26.815 --> 00:12:28.625
in very unexpected ways,

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:31.005
like this home which caught my attention
