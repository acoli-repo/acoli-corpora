00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:00.533
and today they make their living

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:03.723
by collecting and recycling waste from homes

00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:05.974
from all over Cairo.

00:09:05.974 --> 00:09:09.096
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages

00:09:09.096 --> 00:09:10.765
where they would move around

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.284
trying to avoid the local authorities,

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:15.603
but in the early 1980s, they settled

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:17.320
on the Mokattam rocks

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.969
just at the eastern edge of the city.

00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:22.000
Today, they live in this area,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.804
approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,

00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:26.937
who live in this community of self-built

00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:29.117
multi-story houses

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:33.410
where up to three generations live in one structure.
