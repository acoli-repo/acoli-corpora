00:04:55.208 --> 00:05:00.260
just to make it a kind of clean finish.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.719
The inhabitants literally built up these homes

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.876
with their own hands, and this labor of love

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:06.629
instills a great sense of pride

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.881
in many families living in this tower.

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.815
They typically make the best out of their conditions,

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.623
and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,

00:05:15.623 --> 00:05:19.170
or at least up until as far as they can reach.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.182
Throughout the tower, you come across

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:24.348
all kinds of services, like the barber,

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:28.161
small factories, and every floor has

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.585
a little grocery store or shop.
