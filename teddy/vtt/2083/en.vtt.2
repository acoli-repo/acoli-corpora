00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:02.356
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:04.402
CCTV building in Beijing

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:07.240
and the olympic stadium in the same city

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.384
by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.

00:01:10.384 --> 00:01:13.829
At these large-scale construction sites in China,

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.952
you see a sort of makeshift camp

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:20.142
where workers live during the entire building process.

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:22.624
As the length of the construction takes years,

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.382
workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.648
informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:32.091
against the sophisticated structures that they're building.
