00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.156
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:02.603
in order to shorten the hike

00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:06.621
up to the apartments.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.531
A walk through the tower

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.641
reveals how residents have figured out

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.167
how to create walls, how to make an air flow,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.130
how to create transparency,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.554
circulation throughout the tower,

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.373
essentially creating a home

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:22.021
that's completely adapted

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.299
to the conditions of the site.

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.424
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:29.332
they already have a roof over their head,

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:31.371
so they just typically mark their space
