00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.910
like this very distinguished man who is posing

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.119
while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:08.759
or like these two young men who are sitting

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:13.611
and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.

00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.344
While to most of us, living amongst

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:17.432
these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:17.432 --> 00:10:19.783
may seem totally uninhabitable,

00:10:19.783 --> 00:10:21.873
to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just

00:10:21.873 --> 00:10:24.352
a different type of normal.

00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:26.989
In all these places I've talked about today,

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:29.110
what I do find fascinating is that there's really

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.708
no such thing as normal,
