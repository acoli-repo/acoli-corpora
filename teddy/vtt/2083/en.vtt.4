Just over three years ago,

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.694
I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.490
and while flying over the city, I was just amazed

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.530
by the extent to which the slums

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.979
reach into every corner of the city,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.716
a place where nearly 70 percent of the population

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.057
lives in slums,

00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:18.350
draped literally all over the mountains.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.777
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:24.130
I learned about the Torre David,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.673
a 45-story office building which sits

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.726
right in the center of Caracas.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.329
The building was under construction
