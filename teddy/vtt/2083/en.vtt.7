00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.760
Designed in very specific ways

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.236
by this group of people

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:37.132
who haven't had any education in architecture or design.

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:39.413
And with each inhabitant finding their own

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:41.380
unique way of coming by,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.182
this tower becomes like a living city,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.394
a place which is alive with micro-economies

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.311
and small businesses.

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.925
The inventive inhabitants, for instance,

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:54.656
find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.781
like the adjacent parking garage,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:58.858
which has been reclaimed as a taxi route

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.156
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps
