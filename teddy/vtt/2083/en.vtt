00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.360
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.719
to work with many of the great

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:06.445
international architects,

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:08.869
documenting their work and observing

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.828
how their designs have the capacity

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:13.797
to influence the cities in which they sit.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.640
I think of new cities like Dubai

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.117
or ancient cities like Rome

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:22.479
with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.296
or like right here in New York with the High Line,

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.867
a city which has been so much influenced

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.570
by the development of this.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.645
But what I find really fascinating
