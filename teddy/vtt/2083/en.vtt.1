00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.645
But what I find really fascinating

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:34.741
is what happens when architects and planners leave

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.860
and these places become appropriated by people,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.200
like here in Chandigarh, India,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520
the city which has been completely designed

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.659
by the architect Le Corbusier.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.639
Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:49.260
by people in very different ways

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.582
from whatever perhaps intended for,

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.888
like here, where you have the people

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.851
sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.938
But over the course of several years,

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:02.356
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's
