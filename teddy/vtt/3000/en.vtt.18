to actually motivate
them from a very young age,

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:03.043
to tell that girl
that she can do anything.

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:05.954
And if the message comes from her father,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.166
because there are too many stereotypes.

Last year, I was very shocked
when I went to a debate on Women's Day.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.076
They had a survey,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.681
and they were asking these girls
how many women inventors we have,
