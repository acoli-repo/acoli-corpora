00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:01.574
A very small interrogation mark --

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:03.811
and people don't see
the interrogation mark,

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:06.502
they just see my name
and they see my picture.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.257
And that was a sounding board.

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:11.571
And again, as you have just said,

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:14.349
it was a very interesting scenario

00:02:14.373 --> 00:02:18.568
because it was a scenario
where they wanted to have somebody

00:02:18.592 --> 00:02:20.129
who was credible,

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:22.953
had this political neutrality

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.378
and at the same time, was for a minority

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:28.036
because Islam is a minority
religion in Mauritius,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.442
because in Mauritius,
we stratify people's origins
