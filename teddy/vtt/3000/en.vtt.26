00:12:56.746 --> 00:13:00.069
one of the first things I did
was I documented precisely these plants.

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:03.582
And I'll tell you one thing --
it was not perceived to be very serious,

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:06.834
because here I was,
in synthetic organic chemistry,

00:13:06.858 --> 00:13:10.164
going out there,
talking to these grandmothers,

00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:12.182
documenting their recipes.

00:13:12.206 --> 00:13:15.432
I mean, you can't be serious --
bringing weeds in the lab,

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:17.688
and say, "We're going
to be working on these."

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:19.187
Are we going to get results?

00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:23.158
So it was really a race against prejudice

00:13:23.182 --> 00:13:25.917
to try to take people's --

00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:29.042
bring them to the table and say,
"Look, this is very important."

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:30.218
But I'm glad I did,
