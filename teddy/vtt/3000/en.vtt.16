00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:02.463
to study STEM subjects?

00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:05.208
Is that something
that you actively work --

00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:07.586
AGF: You know, over the past
two days, Stephanie,

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.598
we've been hearing a lot of conversation

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.585
about the sustainable development goals.

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:13.039
We've seen that, for example,

00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:14.485
Africa must be food secure,

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:16.608
Africa must be energy secure,

00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:18.446
Africa must be water secure.

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:21.969
If we want to get
to that level of development --

00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:24.796
Agenda 2030 is not very far away --

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.504
if you want to have success,

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:31.559
we need to have
an educated youth in Africa.
