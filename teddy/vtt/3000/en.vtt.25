00:12:28.913 --> 00:12:31.746
and unfortunately,
we are racing against time

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.591
because tradition in Africa is that
the transmission has always been oral.

00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:39.603
So we need to get our act together
and make it happen.

00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:42.245
SB: So there's really a sense
of urgency around this.

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:43.577
AGF: Yes.

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:47.040
(Applause)

00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:51.996
SB: And have you done anything yourself
in respect to documenting --

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.787
AGF: Yes, I definitely did.

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:56.722
When I started my career in academia,

00:12:56.746 --> 00:13:00.069
one of the first things I did
was I documented precisely these plants.
