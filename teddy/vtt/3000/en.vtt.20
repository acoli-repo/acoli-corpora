SB: Yes.

00:10:00.698 --> 00:10:03.779
(Applause)

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:05.910
Thank you.

00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:10.643
So, let's move on to an area
that I know you've been very active in,

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.968
which is the issue of biodiversity.

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:18.542
You've been quite clear that this
is an area that Africa must embrace.

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:22.965
We have an abundance of rich
herbal traditions and plants

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:27.062
that could be developed
into a big pharmaceutical industry.

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:31.104
Can you tell us a little bit
of how you've been using your expertise
