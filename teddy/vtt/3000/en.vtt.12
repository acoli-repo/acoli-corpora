00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.012
but I still think that these two
are not mutually exclusive.

00:06:01.036 --> 00:06:03.433
They can still coexist with each other.

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:08.047
SB: So let's move
to one of your passions -- science.

00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:09.747
You've made no secret of that.

00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.252
And you've always been
passionate about science.

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:14.935
I read that when you were
a very young girl,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.469
you went to a career guidance counselor

00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:20.226
and told them you wanted
to become a chemist,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.931
and they said, "No, it's for boys.

00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:25.613
Boys do science."

00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:29.604
Did that make you even more
determined to study science

00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:31.072
and to succeed in that field?
