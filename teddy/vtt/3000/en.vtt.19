00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.681
and they were asking these girls
how many women inventors we have,

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.198
how many women scientists do we have.

00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:38.324
And you'd be shocked
that hardly anyone knew

00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:41.542
that Ada Lovelace was there
behind computer science,

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:45.306
that Marie Curie still remains iconic
with two Nobel prizes.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.732
So there's a lot of homework to do
to actually make --

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:53.020
to remove all these gender biases
at a very young age;

00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:55.227
instill that confidence in that girl;

00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:59.499
to tell her that she can do as well
if not better than her brother.

00:09:59.523 --> 00:10:00.674
SB: Yes.
