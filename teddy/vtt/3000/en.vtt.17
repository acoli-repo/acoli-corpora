00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:31.559
we need to have
an educated youth in Africa.

00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:33.908
And again, to be very cliché:

00:08:33.932 --> 00:08:37.697
you cannot achieve,
you cannot win a football match,

00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:42.145
if you're going to leave 52 percent
of the team outside.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.717
It's not possible.

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:47.129
(Applause)

00:08:47.554 --> 00:08:48.709
SB: Yes.

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.560
AGF: So we need highly educated,

00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:52.369
we need female intuition,

00:08:52.393 --> 00:08:54.242
and we need to get them there.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:57.818
And this is where a great deal
of effort has to be done

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:00.383
to actually motivate
them from a very young age,
