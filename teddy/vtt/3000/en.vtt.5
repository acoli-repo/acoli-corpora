00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.442
because in Mauritius,
we stratify people's origins

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:34.256
by virtue of their religious belief.

00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:36.466
And -- I was a woman.

where the name of the president

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:58.465
during the campaign.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.912
So when people voted,
they knew that at some point,
