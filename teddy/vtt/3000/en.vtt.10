00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:01.609
I mean, if you're a scientist,

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:05.895
you tend to really look
at the perfection of the human body,

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.094
the way it functions.

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:08.968
If you look at nature as a whole.

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.043
I'm still amazed at the perfection

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.343
with which the entire
ecosystem functions together.

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:20.079
However, to the purists,
to those who are of faith,

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:22.777
they will tell you, "Yes,
there has been evolution."

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:26.597
Even the Pope has agreed
that evolution exists.

00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:29.311
But there's always the question:
What came first?

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:30.643
What came before this?
