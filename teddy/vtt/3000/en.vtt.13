00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:31.072
and to succeed in that field?

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.702
How did you respond to that?

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.014
AGF: Well, to begin with,

00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:38.394
I must say, before I came
to that career guidance officer,

00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:41.580
I had great teachers who motivated.

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:44.562
And this is something I would like
to draw attention to again,

00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:46.164
to our education system.

00:06:46.188 --> 00:06:48.417
We have to do away
with this rote learning.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:52.365
We have to ensure that we drive
this curiosity in the child,

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:53.997
and they need to be curious.

00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.455
And if we want to move along the line
for them to become great scientists,

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.551
they need to become more and more
curious in everything they do.
