00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.454
whenever there was dialogue,

00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:03.703
this was the time when societies
have been most productive.

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:06.676
When we talk about the Arab Golden Age,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.996
we cannot not think of Ibn Sina,

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:11.989
al-Haytham,

00:04:12.013 --> 00:04:13.205
Averroes,

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.386
Maimonides.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.959
This was a time
when cultures, religions --

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:19.557
they were talking to each other.

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:21.277
They were at peace with each other.

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:23.850
And this was a time
when they were highly productive.

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:25.938
So I would say: bring down these walls.

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:27.684
SB: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:30.379
