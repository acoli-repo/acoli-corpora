Can you tell us a little bit
of how you've been using your expertise

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:33.862
to harness growth in this area?

00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:35.583
AGF: Thank you.

00:10:35.607 --> 00:10:37.912
Yesterday, I was listening
to one of the talks;

00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:42.201
it was the talk about the need for Africa
to turn into a knowledge economy.

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.312
Africa has got very rich traditions.

00:10:45.336 --> 00:10:47.876
Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.994
has got over 5,000
medicinal plant species,

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:52.217
not harnessed.

00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:55.162
And, in fact, at the TED talk
I gave in 2014,

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:57.039
I came out with one sentence:

00:10:57.063 --> 00:11:00.134
"Biodiversity underpins life on earth."
