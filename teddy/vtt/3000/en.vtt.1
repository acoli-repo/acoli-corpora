00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.374
And of course, you're no stranger
to the TEDGlobal stage;

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:35.623
you gave a talk in 2014.

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:39.749
Did you have any political
ambitions at that time?

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.151
How did you go from academic to president?

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.716
AGF: OK, thanks, Stephanie.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.497
First of all, I'd like to thank TED

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:49.127
for having given me
the opportunity to be here today.

00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:52.860
And I would also like to thank
the government of Tanzania

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:56.229
and the president for the welcome.

00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:59.679
And also, I'd like to thank
the contribution of our consul,

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.136
Mr. Rizvi, who's here,
