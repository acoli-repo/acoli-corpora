00:14:58.113 --> 00:15:01.547
because I've been an academic,
I've been an entrepreneur, now I'm here.

00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:03.184
I'm hoping to have a fourth life.

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.991
So put these to work for the continent.

00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:10.599
And this is why I have chosen
to give my voice to so many initiatives

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:14.551
that would help the youth of Africa
become tech-savvy,

00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:15.975
become science-savvy,

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.620
because as I said earlier on,

00:15:17.644 --> 00:15:21.642
up until they get to grips with science,

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:26.334
with whatever is around --
media, technology, you name it,

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:30.697
all calls for a good grounding in science,
technology and innovation.
