I think the journey started
immediately after TED, actually.

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.888
When I went back,
this journalist called me and said,

00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:40.412
"You know, your name has been cited
for the president of the republic,"

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:42.266
I said, "Ma'am, you must be mistaken,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.203
because I have no ambition whatsoever."

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:45.571
She said, "No, it's serious.

00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:49.002
Can you come and tell me this
in the form of a declaration?

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.563
So, OK, you'll come?"

00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:53.221
So, of course, as good journalists go,

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.496
the next day I see my TED picture

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.220
and, with my name, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim,

00:01:58.244 --> 00:01:59.504
"For president?"

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:01.574
A very small interrogation mark --
