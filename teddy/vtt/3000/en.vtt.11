00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:30.643
What came before this?

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:34.571
When we talk about all
the various strata of evolution,

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.468
we'll always be asking the question,

00:05:36.492 --> 00:05:38.087
there must be something before.

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.946
So I'm of the opinion that yes,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.564
there is this great spiritual force
which is guiding the process,

00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:47.895
and things like this
don't happen by chance.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.105
Now, whether you call it religiosity,

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.634
whether you call
this great spirit by any name --

00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:56.516
Brahma, Allah, the Holy Trinity --

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.716
you name it --

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.012
but I still think that these two
are not mutually exclusive.
