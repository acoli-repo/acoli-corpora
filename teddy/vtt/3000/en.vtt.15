one must always follow your heart.

00:07:32.484 --> 00:07:34.535

I did what I was passionate about,

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:39.969
and I thought at some point
that I had developed this thinking

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.276
that if you're passionate
about what you do,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.752
you will not have to work
a single day in your life,

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.368
until I realized it was
Confucius who said that.

00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:49.123

00:07:49.847 --> 00:07:55.123
SB: So do you feel a responsibility,
as someone in your position,

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:58.322
to encourage young girls,
especially on this continent,

00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:02.463
to study STEM subjects?
