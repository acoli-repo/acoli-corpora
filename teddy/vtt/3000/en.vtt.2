Mr. Rizvi, who's here,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.614
has been very supportive
for all our stay here.

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:07.120
Now, to answer your question,

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:10.106
did I have any ambitions in politics?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.064
The straight answer is no.

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.388
I did not choose the world of politics;

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:16.247
the world of politics chose me.

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.421
So here I am.

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:19.509
(Applause)

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:22.483
SB: So, was there ever
anything in your journey

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:24.360
that ever made you think

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.368
that one day you would become
president of your country?

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:28.681
Did you ever imagine that?

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:29.857
AGF: Absolutely not.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.323
I think the journey started
immediately after TED, actually.
