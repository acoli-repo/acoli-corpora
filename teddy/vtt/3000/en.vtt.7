by background I mean not ethnic,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.491
to be there,

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:38.232
to be that role model for that little girl
growing in my village

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.727
to say, "Yes, it's possible."

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:40.901

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:44.009

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.468

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:58.646
whenever there was openness,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.454
whenever there was dialogue,
