00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.039
If you live on the east coast
of the United States,

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:11.490
you've spent the last
17 years of your life

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:13.286
walking, eating and sleeping

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.856
above a dormant army of insects.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.228
These are the cicadas.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.033
Every 17 years,

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:23.205
billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things:

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.979
molt, mate and die.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.351
There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.580
grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground.
