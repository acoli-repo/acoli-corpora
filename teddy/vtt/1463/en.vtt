00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There's a poem written

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
by a very famous English poet

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
at the end of the 19th century.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in the 1930s.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the poem goes:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"On the idle hill of summer,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
lazy with the flow of streams,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
hark I hear a distant drummer,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
drumming like a sound in dreams,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
dear to friend and food to powder,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
soldiers marching,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
soon to die."
