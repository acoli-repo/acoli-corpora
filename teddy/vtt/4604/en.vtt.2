00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.837
In one survey, about 90% of respondents
said that it's okay to flip the switch,

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:04.250
letting one worker die to save five,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.600
and other studies, including a virtual
reality simulation of the dilemma,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.040
have found similar results.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.061
These judgments are consistent with the
philosophical principle of utilitarianism

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.521
which argues that 
the morally correct decision

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:23.351
is the one that maximizes well-being
for the greatest number of people.

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.481
The five lives outweigh one,

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.562
even if achieving that outcome requires
condemning someone to death.
