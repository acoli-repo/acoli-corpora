00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.984
The dilemma in its many variations reveal
that what we think is right or wrong

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:36.345
depends on factors other than 
a logical weighing of the pros and cons.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.835
For example, men are more likely
than women

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:42.504
to say it's okay to push the man
over the bridge.

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:46.994
So are people who watch a comedy clip
before doing the thought experiment.

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:49.165
And in one virtual reality study,

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:52.944
people were more willing 
to sacrifice men than women.

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:55.214
Researchers have studied 
the brain activity

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:59.535
of people thinking through the classic
and bridge versions.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:04.054
Both scenarios activate areas of the brain
involved in conscious decision-making
