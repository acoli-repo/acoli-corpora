00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:04.054
Both scenarios activate areas of the brain
involved in conscious decision-making

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:06.514
and emotional responses.

00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:10.975
But in the bridge version,
the emotional response is much stronger.

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:13.194
So is activity in an area of the brain

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.884
associated with processing 
internal conflict.

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:18.145
Why the difference?

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:22.912
One explanation is that pushing someone
to their death feels more personal,

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:26.925
activating an emotional aversion
to killing another person,

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:31.424
but we feel conflicted because we know
it's still the logical choice.
