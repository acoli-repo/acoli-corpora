00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:11.521
Imagine you're watching a runaway trolley
barreling down the tracks

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.961
straight towards five workers
who can't escape.

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.179
You happen to be standing next to a switch

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.680
that will divert the trolley
onto a second track.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.980
Here's the problem.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.069
That track has a worker on it, too,
but just one.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.390
What do you do?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.685
Do you sacrifice one person to save five?
