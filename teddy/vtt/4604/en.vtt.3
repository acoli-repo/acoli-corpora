00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.562
even if achieving that outcome requires
condemning someone to death.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:33.471
But people don't always take
the utilitarian view,

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.062
which we can see by changing
the trolley problem a bit.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.303
This time, you're standing on a bridge
over the track

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:43.192
as the runaway trolley approaches.

00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:44.873
Now there's no second track,

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:48.794
but there is a very large man 
on the bridge next to you.

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:52.492
If you push him over, 
his body will stop the trolley,

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:54.243
saving the five workers,

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:56.033
but he'll die.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.432
To utilitarians, 
the decision is exactly the same,

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:01.982
lose one life to save five.
