Meanwhile, governments are researching
autonomous military drones

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:05.976
that could wind up making decisions of
whether they'll risk civilian casualties

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:09.276
to attack a high-value target.

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:11.197
If we want these actions to be ethical,

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:15.397
we have to decide in advance
how to value human life

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:17.667
and judge the greater good.

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.107
So researchers who study 
autonomous systems

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:22.207
are collaborating with philosophers

00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:27.628
to address the complex problem
of programming ethics into machines,

00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:30.957
which goes to show that 
even hypothetical dilemmas
