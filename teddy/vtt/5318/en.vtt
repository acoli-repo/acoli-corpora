Arriving home after a long day, you settle
in for a quiet evening alone.

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:17.289
But instead of the sound of silence, 
you hear a constant ringing—

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.449
even though there’s nothing 
making any noise.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.680
What you’re experiencing 
is called tinnitus,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.754
the perception of a noise like ringing, 
buzzing, hissing or clicking

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.754
that occurs without any external source 
of sound.
