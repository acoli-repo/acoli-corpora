00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:33.217
And the prints at the exhibition
are around the three-meter mark.

00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.804
In fact, I had a show
in Milan two weeks ago,

00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:38.585
and we had some prints there
that were nine meters long.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:41.381
But, you know, I realize

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:44.313
that these images still have to work
in the digital world.

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:47.429
There's no point in me putting
all my blood, sweat and tears

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.604
into these pictures

00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:51.753
if they're only going to be showing
500 pixels on a screen.

00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:55.318
So with the help of Rob Chandler
and Will Cookson,

00:04:55.342 --> 00:04:57.136
we developed a website

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.965
that enables the viewer
to immerse themselves

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:02.014
into the full four-gigabyte files,
