00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.716
So, I had been a photographer

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.174
for 18 years

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:07.592
before I began the Microsculpture Project.

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.994
And in that time,
I had shot global ad campaigns,

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:15.199
I had the opportunity to photograph
some of my generation's icons,

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:16.879
and I was traveling the world.

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:21.246
I got to a point in my career
that I dreamed of getting to,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.943
and yet, for some reason,
I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:29.156
Despite the extraordinary things
I was shooting and experiencing,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.080
they'd started to feel
a little bit ordinary to me.
