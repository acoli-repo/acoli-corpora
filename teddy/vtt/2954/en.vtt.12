(Laughter)

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:04.228
And at the end of the day, actually,
at the end of the day at the exhibitions,

00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:07.273
we have to wipe down
the lower third of the big prints --

00:06:07.297 --> 00:06:08.296
(Laughter)

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.495
just to remove
all those sticky handprints,

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:13.335
because all they want to do
is touch those big bugs.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.910
I do want to leave you
with one final image, if that's OK.

00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:19.983

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:22.856

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:24.814
was this one here.

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.708
I'm talking about the creature
in the box, not my cat.

00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.491
And this is a shield bug
