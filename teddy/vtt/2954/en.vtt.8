00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:01.389
Each has a tiny sliver of focus
all the way through.

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:03.509
And I can squash that down

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:06.964
to produce one image
that is fully focused from front to back.

00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:10.533
So essentially, that gives me
25 sections that are fully focused

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:11.933
and beautifully lit.

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:14.688
Now, each one of my images

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:18.773
is made up of anywhere
between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.123
They take about three-and-a-half
weeks to create,

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:26.400
and the file sizes on average
are about four gigabytes.

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:29.543
So I've got plenty of information
to play with when I'm printing.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:33.217
And the prints at the exhibition
are around the three-meter mark.
