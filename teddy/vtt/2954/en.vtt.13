00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.491
And this is a shield bug

00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:34.688
that Charles Darwin
brought back from Australia

00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:37.040
on the HMS Beagle in 1836.

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:39.701
And when I got it home,

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:42.594
I stood in my kitchen
and stared at it for about 20 minutes.

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:46.431
I couldn't believe I was in possession
of this beautiful creature.

00:06:46.455 --> 00:06:48.724
And at that moment, I kind of realized

00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:50.611
that this validated the project for me.

00:06:50.635 --> 00:06:54.113
The fact that the museum
was willing to risk me playing with this

00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:56.463
kind of showed me
that my images had worth --

00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:58.283
you know, they weren't disposable.

00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:00.849
That's the image that I produced.
