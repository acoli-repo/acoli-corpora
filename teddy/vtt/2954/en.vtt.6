00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.714
is that I essentially split the insect
up into multiple sections,

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:05.546
and I treat each one of those sections
like a small still life.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.290
So for example, if I was photographing
the eye of the insect,

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.102
which is normally quite smooth
and dome-shaped,

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:16.505
then I'd use a light source
that is large and soft and diffuse,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.870
so I don't get any harsh hot spots
on that surface.

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:23.962
But once my attention
turns over to a hairy leg,

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.559
that lighting setup
will change completely.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:30.220
And so I make that one tiny section
look as beautiful as I possibly can,
