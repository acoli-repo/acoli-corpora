00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.767
and he brought it up to my office,

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.218
and we decided to look at it
under his microscope.

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:35.636
He had a little science kit for Christmas.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.667
And this is what we saw.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.397
Now, when I first saw this,
it blew me away.

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.458
Up here -- this is the back
of the ground beetle.

00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:47.026
When I first saw it,
it reminded me of a galaxy.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.401
And all the time, this had just
been outside our window.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.110
You know, I was looking
for this extraordinary subject,

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:56.637
and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity
to bring it in to me.

00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:01.239
So I decided to photograph it for him,
and this is what I produced.
