00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:02.014
into the full four-gigabyte files,

00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:05.068
and they can explore
all that microscopic detail.

00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:07.697
So if you have the time,
and I encourage you,

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.488
please visit microsculpture.net

00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:11.027
and go and have a play.

00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:12.209
It's good fun.

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:16.024
I first showed the work at Oxford,

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.972
and since then, it's moved on
to the Middle East.

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:22.117
It's now back in Europe
and goes to Copenhagen this month.

00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:24.322
And the feedback has been great.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:29.571
You know, I get emails, actually,
from all over the world --

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.750
from teachers, at the moment,
who are using the website in school.
