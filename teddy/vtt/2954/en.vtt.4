00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:01.239
So I decided to photograph it for him,
and this is what I produced.

00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:04.009
I basically asked myself
two simple questions.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.199
The first one:

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:09.041
Could I take all my knowledge and skill
of photographic lighting

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.195
and take that onto a subject
that's five millimeters long?

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.850
But also: Could I keep
creative control over that lighting

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.590
on a subject that size?

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:20.920
So I practiced
on some other found specimens,

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:24.470
and I approached the Oxford University
Museum of Natural History

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:27.306
to see if I could have access
to their collection,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.808
to progress the project.

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:31.246
And I went up there for a meeting,
