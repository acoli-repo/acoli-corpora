00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:30.220
And so I make that one tiny section
look as beautiful as I possibly can,

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:32.068
and I work my way across the insect

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:34.864
until I have about 20 or 25
different sections.

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:40.105
The issue with photography
at high magnification

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.374
is that there is inherently
a very shallow depth of field.

00:03:43.398 --> 00:03:46.161
So to get around that, what I do is,

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.627
I put my camera on a rail

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.994
that I can automate
to move 10 microns in between each shot.

00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:53.673
That's about one-seventh the width
of a human hair.

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:58.304
And then that provides me
with a deep stack of images.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:01.389
Each has a tiny sliver of focus
all the way through.
