00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:31.246
And I went up there for a meeting,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.146
and I showed them some of the images
that I'd been shooting,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.291
and they could see
the kind of detail I was able to get.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.109
I don't think they'd ever really seen
anything quite like it before,

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.635
and from that point forward,
they gave me open access

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.973
to their entire collection

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.867
and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan,
their entomologist.

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.187
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:55.255
I shot 37 insects from their collection.

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:57.606
And the way I work

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.714
is that I essentially split the insect
up into multiple sections,
