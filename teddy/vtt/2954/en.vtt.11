00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.750
from teachers, at the moment,
who are using the website in school.

00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:34.602
The kids are using them on the tablet.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.327
They're zooming into the pictures

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.578
and using it for art class, biology class.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:40.750
And that's not something I planned.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:43.365
That's just a beautiful offshoot
of the project.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.018
In fact, one of the things
I like to do at the exhibitions

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.119
is actually look at
the kiddies' reactions.

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:51.866
And, you know, standing
in front of a three-meter insect,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.425
they could have been horrified.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.335
But they're not. They look in wonder.

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:58.805
This little chap here, he stood there
for five minutes, motionless.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.291
(Laughter)
