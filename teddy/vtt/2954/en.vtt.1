they'd started to feel
a little bit ordinary to me.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:33.631
I was also getting concerned

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.781
about how disposable photography
had started to feel in the digital world,

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:41.664
and I really wanted to produce images
that had a sense of worth again.

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:44.087
And I needed a subject
that felt extraordinary.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:48.132
Sometimes I wish
I had the eyes of a child.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.700
And by that I mean,
I wish I could look at the world

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:52.977
in the same as I did
when I was a small boy.

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:55.542
I think there is a danger,
as we get older,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:01:00.645
that our curiosity becomes
slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.
