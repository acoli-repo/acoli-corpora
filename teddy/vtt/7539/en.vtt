00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:11.924
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:17.180
The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay—

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.766
and food and drink flowed freely.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:24.604
But in the midst of the revelry,
the castle doors split open.

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:29.984
A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room,

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.403
stunning the court into silence.
