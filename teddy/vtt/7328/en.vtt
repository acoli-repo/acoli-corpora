Hi, I'm Jeff.

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:06.579
I lead AI Research and Health at Google.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:08.496
I joined Google more than 20 years ago,

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:11.704

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.454

in downtown Palo Alto.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:18.038
I've seen a lot of computing
transformations in that time,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.538
and in the last decade, we've seen AI
be able to do tremendous things.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.288
But we're still doing it
all wrong in many ways.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.538
That's what I want
to talk to you about today.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.788
But first, let's talk
about what AI can do.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.121
So in the last decade,
we've seen tremendous progress
