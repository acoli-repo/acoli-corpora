00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.856
face additional challenges
when accessing pools and gyms,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.576
but also universities,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.360
hospitals, libraries.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
Don't even get me started
on how they treat us in airports.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.680
If we don't move now

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.416
to make sure that these places

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.496
are truly open and accessible to everyone,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.800
then we just need to get honest

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.160
and quit calling them public places.
