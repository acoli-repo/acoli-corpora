00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.666
Well, thank you all so much
for being here today,

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.669
because I am super excited to tell you

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.006
that we are about to explore
space in a big way.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:15.928
And the future of space exploration
is like nothing we’ve ever seen before,

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:18.431
and the future is one
we can hardly even imagine.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.975
Well, why is that?

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.020
We’ve been exploring space
since the 1950s,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.480
so what’s different now?

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.149
Well, for the first time ever,

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.402
we are going to be using
supersized spacecraft
