00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.040
is that a man could monitor
his contraceptive status over time.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.296
In the last several years,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.576
two groups have introduced
home sperm-testing devices

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.096
that are iPhone-based

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.760
and that are easy to use.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.936
A man could test his sperm count
and share the result with his partner.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.776
If the man's sperm count were zero,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.616
the man and his partner
would feel very comfortable

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.496
relying on his contraceptive.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.696
A tool like this,
coupled with a male contraceptive,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.040
could greatly increase the role for men
in preventing unintended pregnancy.
