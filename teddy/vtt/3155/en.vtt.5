00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.120
with the way the sperm
swim towards or bind to the egg.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.056
This approach turns out
to be really difficult,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.176
because it's hard to get enough medication
in the small volume of the ejaculate

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.520
and have it still work inside
the female reproductive tract.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.376
This is why there's been a lot more work
done on the second approach,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.520
which is turning off
sperm production entirely.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.136
This is also challenging.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.256
Why? Turns out
that men make a lot of sperm.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.696
(Laughter)

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.320
Men make a thousand sperm every second
