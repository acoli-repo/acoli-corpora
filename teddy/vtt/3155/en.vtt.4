Why are 20 percent of couples
relying on condoms for contraception

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
when condoms have a one-year
failure rate of over 15 percent?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.056
It's because many women
can't either safely take

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.816
currently available female contraceptives,
for reasons such as blood clots,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.200
or they can't tolerate the side effects.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.136
So if we think a male contraceptive
would be useful, the next question is:

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.200
How do we go about developing one?

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.920
Well, there's two general approaches.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.616
The first approach is to try and interfere

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.120
with the way the sperm
swim towards or bind to the egg.
