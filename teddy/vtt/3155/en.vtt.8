00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.896
Why? Well, for over 90 years
it's been known

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.280
that you need vitamin A to make sperm.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.976
Animals who are deprived
of vitamin A in their diet

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.896
stop making sperm

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.600
and restart making sperm again
when the vitamin A is reintroduced.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.255
The vitamin A that we ingest

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.360
is converted by a family of enzymes
to something called retinoic acid.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.056
One of these enzymes
is found only in the testes.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.176
It's this enzyme
that we are attempting to block.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.616
The blockade of this enzyme
should deprive the testes of retinoic acid
