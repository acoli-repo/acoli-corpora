00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.856
Happily, the rate of unintended pregnancy
has fallen in the last few years

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.696
by about 10 percent.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.656
This is because more women
are using effective, long-acting,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.600
reversible forms of contraception.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840
But we still have a long way to go.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.216
One approach that's finally
becoming a real possibility

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.360
is better contraceptive options for men.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.816
Think about it.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.496
We have over a dozen methods
of contraception for women:

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.360
pills, patches, IUDs,
shots, sponges, rings, etc.
