Men make a thousand sperm every second

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.576
and to have an effective contraceptive,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.776
you need to get that level
of sperm production

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000
down to one percent of its normal value.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.336
The good news is, this is possible,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.776
almost.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.800
The most studied approach has been to use
hormones to suppress sperm production.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.136
Testosterone and progesterone,
when administered together,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.336
will suppress the signals from the brain
to the testes to make sperm,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.496
and in about 90 percent of men,
