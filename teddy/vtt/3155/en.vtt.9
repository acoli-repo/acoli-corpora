The blockade of this enzyme
should deprive the testes of retinoic acid

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.576
and stop sperm production

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.800
without affecting vitamin A's functions
elsewhere in the body.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.616
We're testing this approach in animals

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.800
and hope to move to human testing soon.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.376
Obviously, the impact
of such a male contraceptive

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.800
would go well beyond reproductive biology.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.496
It's interesting to speculate
about the effect that it would have

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.400
on relationships between men and women.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.776
One intriguing possibility

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.040
is that a man could monitor
his contraceptive status over time.
