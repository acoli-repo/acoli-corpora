00:02:57.317 --> 00:03:00.147
but any member of the community
could be targeted,

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.317
even occasionally children.

00:03:02.317 --> 00:03:04.837
While religious authorities encouraged 
witch hunts,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:07.917
local secular governments usually carried 
out the detainment

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:10.517
and punishment of accused witches.

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:14.401
Those suspected of witchcraft were 
questioned and often tortured—

00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:19.001
and under torture, thousands of innocent 
people confessed to witchcraft

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.612
and implicated others in turn.

00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:26.342
Because these witch hunts occurred 
sporadically over centuries and continents

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:29.046
the specifics varied considerably.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:35.006
Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake.
