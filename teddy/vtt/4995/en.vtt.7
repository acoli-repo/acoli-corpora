00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:35.006
Punishments for convicted witches ranged 
from small fines to burning at the stake.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:39.789
The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were 
accused dragged on for nine years,

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.048
while others lasted just months.

00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:46.094
They could have anywhere from a few to a 
few hundred victims.

00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:49.694
The motivations of the witch hunters 
probably varied as well,

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:53.914
but it seems likely that many weren’t 
consciously looking for scapegoats—

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.239
instead, they sincerely believed 
in witchcraft,

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.649
and thought they were doing good by 
rooting it out in their communities.
