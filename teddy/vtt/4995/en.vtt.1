Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.259
She wrote to her husband from jail

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:40.949

confess under torture,

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.999
even though she was innocent.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.099
After giving a false confession,

that occurred in Europe and the American

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:58.860

until the early 18th century.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.310
These witch hunts were not a unified 
initiative by a single authority,
