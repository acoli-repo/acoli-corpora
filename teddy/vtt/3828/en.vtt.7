00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:32.080
and cemeteries and mortuaries,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.541
and they tell the story
of the different spaces

00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.374
that we pass through
on either side of death.

00:03:37.374 --> 00:03:39.719
We wanted to show
that where we die

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.970
is a key part of how we die.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.753
Now, the strangest thing was the way
that visitors reacted to the exhibition,

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:50.121
especially the audio-visual works.

00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:53.813
We had people dancing
and running and jumping

00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:56.808
as they tried to activate
the exhibits in different ways,

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:59.252
and at a certain point
they would kind of stop

00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:01.986
and remember that they were in
an exhibition about death,
