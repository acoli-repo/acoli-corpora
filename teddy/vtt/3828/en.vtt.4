It has these courtyards in the middle

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:02.619
so that all of the rooms
have daylight and fresh air,

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.032
and the rooms are big
and they have high ceilings,

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:07.516
so they just feel
more comfortable to be in.

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:09.281
And it's also beautiful.

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:13.112
Somehow, we've forgotten
that that's even possible for a hospital.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:17.135
Now, if we want better buildings
for dying, then we have to talk about it,

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.706
but because we find the subject
of death uncomfortable,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.146
we don't talk about it,

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:24.458
and we don't question how we
as a society approach death.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:27.632
One of the things that surprised me
most in my research, though,

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:30.317
is how changeable attitudes actually are.
