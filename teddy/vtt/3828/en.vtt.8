00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:01.986
and remember that they were in
an exhibition about death,

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:04.610
and that maybe that's not
how you're supposed to act.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.257
But actually, I would question
whether there is one way

00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:09.532
that you're supposed to act around death,

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:14.083
and if there's not, I'd ask you to think
about what you think a good death is,

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:17.752
and what you think that architecture
that supports a good death might be like,

00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:22.480
and mightn't it be a little less like this
and a little more like this?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.694
Thank you.

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:26.714
