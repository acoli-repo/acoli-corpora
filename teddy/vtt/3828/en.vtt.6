00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:02.220
in Venice in June,
which was called "Death in Venice."

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.494
It was designed to be quite playful

00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:07.692
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:10.947
This is one of our exhibits,
which is an interactive map of London

00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.622
that shows just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:15.501
is given over to death and dying,

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:17.870
and as you wave your hand across the map,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.699
the name of that piece of real estate,
the building or cemetery, is revealed.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.207
Another of our exhibits
was a series of postcards

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:27.204
that people could take away with them.

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:29.665
And they showed people's homes
and hospitals

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:32.080
and cemeteries and mortuaries,
