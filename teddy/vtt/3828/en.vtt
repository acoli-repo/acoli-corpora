I'd like to tell you a story
about death and architecture.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:09.471
A hundred years ago, we tended to die
of infectious diseases like pneumonia,

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:12.768
that, if they took hold,
would take us away quite quickly.

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:16.502
We tended to die at home,
in our own beds, looked after by family,

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:18.294
although that was the default option

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:20.884
because a lot of people
lacked access to medical care.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.393
And then in the 20th century
a lot of things changed.

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.490
We developed new medicines like penicillin

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.975
so we could treat
those infectious diseases.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.249
New medical technologies
like x-ray machines were invented.
