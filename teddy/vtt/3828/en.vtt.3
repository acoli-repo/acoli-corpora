00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:32.154
You know those fluorescent lights
and the endless corridors

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.172
and those rows of uncomfortable chairs.

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:38.934
Hospital architecture
has earned its bad reputation.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.091
But the surprising thing is,
it wasn't always like this.

00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:46.425
This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti,
built in 1419 by Brunelleschi,

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:50.172
who was one of the most famous
and influential architects of his time.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.515
And when I look at this building
and then think about hospitals today,

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.603
what amazes me is
this building's ambition.

00:01:56.603 --> 00:01:58.252
It's just a really great building.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.086
It has these courtyards in the middle
