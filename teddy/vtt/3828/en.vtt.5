00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:30.317
is how changeable attitudes actually are.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.709
This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.518
which was built in Woking in the 1870s.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:38.925
And when this was first built,
there were protests in the local village.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:43.808
Cremation wasn't socially acceptable,
and 99.8 percent of people got buried.

00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:47.584
And yet, only a hundred years later,
three quarters of us get cremated.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.111
People are actually really open
to changing things

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.512
if they're given the chance
to talk about them.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:55.835
So this conversation
about death and architecture

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:58.994
was what I wanted to start
when I did my first exhibition on it

00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:02.220
in Venice in June,
which was called "Death in Venice."
