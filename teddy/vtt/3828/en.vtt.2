00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.785
but with all of the focus on life,
death was forgotten,

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.190
even as our approach to death
changed dramatically.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.783
Now, I'm an architect,

00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:08.025
and for the past year and a half
I've been looking at these changes

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:11.179
and at what they mean for architecture
related to death and dying.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.412
We now tend to die
of cancer and heart disease,

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:18.408
and what that means is that many of us
will have a long period of chronic illness

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:20.382
at the end of our lives.

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:21.495
During that period,

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:26.558
we'll likely spend a lot of time 
in hospitals and hospices and care homes.

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.764
Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:32.154
You know those fluorescent lights
and the endless corridors
