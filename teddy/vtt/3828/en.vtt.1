00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.249
New medical technologies
like x-ray machines were invented.

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.501
And because they were
so big and expensive,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.519
we needed large, centralized
buildings to keep them in,

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.818
and they became our modern hospitals.

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:41.241
After the Second World War,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.881
a lot of countries set up 
universal healthcare systems

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.528
so that everyone who needed
treatment could get it.

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:50.777
The result was that lifespans extended
from about 45 at the start of the century

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.960
to almost double that today.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.058
The 20th century was this time of huge 
optimism about what science could offer,

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.785
but with all of the focus on life,
death was forgotten,
