We are told that divine knowledge
comes down through the masculine,

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.973
whether it be to the imam,
the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:42.717
Similarly, we're told that creative genius
resides in the masculine,

00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.487
that it is the masculine

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.576
that will be able to tell us
about who we really are,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.667
that the masculine will tell
the universal story

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.578
on behalf of all of us,

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:57.177
whereas women artists will really
just talk about women's experiences,

00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.577
women's issues
only really relevant to women
