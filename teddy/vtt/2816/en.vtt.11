00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:31.854
and are you prepared to pay
for the therapy bills?"

00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:33.292
(Laughter)

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:36.288
Twenty years later, I haven't
had a word back from him,

00:05:36.312 --> 00:05:37.750
but I'm still hopeful.

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.384
(Laughter)

00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.012
But I thought it was interesting,

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:43.908
because if you read reviews
of what he intended with E.T.,

00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:45.723
he says very specifically,

00:05:45.747 --> 00:05:48.249
"I wanted the world to understand

00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:51.480
that we should love
and embrace difference."

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:56.126
But somehow he didn't include
the idea of girls' difference

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.842
in this thinking.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:02.176
He thought he was writing a story
about all humanity.
