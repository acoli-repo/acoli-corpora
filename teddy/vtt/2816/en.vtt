Why do we think

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:07.894
that stories by men are deemed
to be of universal importance,

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:12.773
and stories by women are thought
to be merely about women?

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.552
My grandmother left school
when she was 12.

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:19.247
She had 14 children.

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:22.247
My mother left school when she was 15.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.672
She was a secretary.

and that progress is entirely to do
with the fact that people I'll never meet
