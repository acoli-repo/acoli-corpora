We have to have a look at this ourselves.

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.949
We have to be prepared to go back
through all our books and our films,

00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:37.310
all our favorite things,

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:40.164
and say, "Actually, this is written
by a male artist --

00:06:40.188 --> 00:06:42.176
not an artist.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.604
We have to see
that so many of these stories

00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:46.764
are written through a male perspective.

00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:48.725
Which is fine,

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:52.247
but then females need to have
50 percent of the rights

00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.825
for the stage, the film, the novel,

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.638
the place of creativity.

00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:59.360
Let me talk about "Hamlet."

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:01.077
To be or not to be.
