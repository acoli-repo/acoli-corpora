00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:02.985
We have to find a way

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:05.653
of stopping young girls and women

00:10:05.677 --> 00:10:08.518
feeling not only that
their story doesn't matter,

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:11.752
but they're not allowed
to be the storyteller.

00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:16.244
Because once you feel
that you can't stand in the central space

00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:19.276
and speak on behalf of the world,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.375
you will feel that you can offer
your goods up to a small, select group.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.915
You will tend to do smaller work
on smaller stages,

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.972
your economic power will be less,

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.468
your reach of audiences will be less,
