The current head
of the Paris Conservatoire

00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:35.119
said recently, "It takes
great physical strength

00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:36.624
to conduct a symphony,

00:09:36.648 --> 00:09:38.099
and women are too weak."

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:39.576
(Laughter)

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.539
The artist George Baselitz said,

00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:43.850
"Well, the fact is women can't paint.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.720
Well -- they can't paint very well."

00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:48.582
The writer V.S. Naipaul
said two years ago,

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:52.198
"I can read two paragraphs and know
immediately if it's written by a woman,

00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.923
and I just stop reading,
because it's not worthy of me."

00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:56.620
Audience: Whoa!

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.022
And it goes on.
