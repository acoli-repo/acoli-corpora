00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:01.781
And then all of a sudden I realized:

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:03.216
they weren't children;

00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:05.120
they were boys --

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.820
all boys.

00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:10.821
And Caroline, who had invested
so much in E.T.,

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.015
well, she wasn't invited to save him,

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.716
and she felt humiliated and spurned.

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:18.161
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:24.353
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:26.927
and I said, "I don't know
if you understand

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.330
the psychological importance
of what's happened,

00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:31.854
and are you prepared to pay
for the therapy bills?"
