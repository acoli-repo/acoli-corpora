00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:00.592
Well then, please go forward,

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.866
support women artists,

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.364
buy their work,

00:12:04.388 --> 00:12:06.656
insist that their voices are heard,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.950
find platforms on which
their voices will be made.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.467
And remember this:

00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:15.770
that in a sense, if we're going
to get past this moment

00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:19.646
of a world where we know
that we are unequal,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.867
it's artists who have to imagine
a different world.

00:12:22.891 --> 00:12:26.501
And I'm calling on all artists,
women and men,

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:29.865
to imagine a gender-equal world.
