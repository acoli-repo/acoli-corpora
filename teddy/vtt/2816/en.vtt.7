I want to tell you
about two examples of stories

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.548
that are thought to be
of universal importance:

00:03:34.572 --> 00:03:37.328
"E.T." and "Hamlet."

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.463
(Laughter)

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.753
So I took my two children
when they were little --

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:47.027
Caroline was eight and Robby was five --

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.618
to see "E.T."

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:52.027
And it's a fantastic story
of this little alien

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.002
who ends up in an American family

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:57.235
with a mum, two brothers and a sister,

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.902
but he wants to go home.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.340
Not only that, but some
really bad scientists
