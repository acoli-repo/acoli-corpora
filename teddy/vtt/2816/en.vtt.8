00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.340
Not only that, but some
really bad scientists

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:04.738
want to do some experiments on him,

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:06.448
and they're looking for him.

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.049
So the children have a plot.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.910
They decide they're going to take him
back to his spaceship

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:13.085
as soon as they can,

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.983
and they plop him in a bicycle basket,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.349
and off they ride.

00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:20.269
But unfortunately, the baddies
have found out, and they're catching up

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.650
and they've got sirens
and they've got their guns,

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.348
they've got the loud-hailers,
it's terribly frightening,

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.292
and they're closing up on the children,

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.412
and the children are never
going to make it.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.529
And then all of a sudden, magically,
the bikes fly up in the air,
