00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:31.500
When a woman writes about doing it,

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:34.039
it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:35.272
(Laughter)

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:39.130
Now, this is not just something
that belongs to then.

00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:40.954
I mean, when I was a young girl,

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:43.602
wanting desperately
to be a theater director,

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:46.465
this is what my male lecturer said to me:

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:50.561
"Well, there are three women
directors in Britain," he said, "Jude."

00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:54.692
"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,
there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,

00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:57.496
and there's Buzz Goodbody,
who's just killed herself.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.776
So, which of those three
would you like to be?"

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.853
(Laughter)
