00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.301
who we find out about each other

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.535
because of the meaning of our lives.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.883
That's what art is for.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.933
So look at this little picture.

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:39.903
I think it's a little girl.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:42.703
I thought it was a bit like me
when I was a little girl.

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.362
And I thought, well, who painted
this joyful, youthful figure?

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.490
And I asked the curator of the caves.

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:53.032
I said, "Tell me about the men
and women who painted these."

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:56.533
And he looked at me
absolutely askance, and he said,

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.769
"Women didn't paint these pictures."

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:01.745
And I said, "Well,
it was 11,000 years ago."
