00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:31.637
and that progress is entirely to do
with the fact that people I'll never meet

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:33.909
fought for women to have rights,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.074
get the vote, get education,
have progress.

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:40.683
And I'm determined to do the same,
and obviously you are, too.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.884
Why not?

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.465
(Applause)

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.201
So I started a festival called WOW,
Women of the World, seven years ago,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.229
and it's now in 20 countries
across five continents.

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:53.604
And one of those countries
is Somaliland in Africa.

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:55.843
So I traveled there last year,

00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:01.460
and part of the joy I had in going there
was going to these caves.
