00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.509
Let's paint it. Let's draw it.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.328
Let's write about it. Let's film it.

00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:36.238
And if we could imagine it,

00:12:36.262 --> 00:12:39.742
then we would have the energy
and the stamina

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:41.255
to work towards it.

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.856
When I see this little girl,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.920
11,000 years ago,

00:12:45.944 --> 00:12:49.405
I want to know that the little girl now

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:52.713
can stand there and think
she's entitled to her dreams,

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:55.027
she's entitled to her destiny

00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:59.253
and she's entitled to speak
on behalf of the whole world,

00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.101
be recognized for it
