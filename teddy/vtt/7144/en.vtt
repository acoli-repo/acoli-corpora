You might have heard that if you drop
a frog in a pot of boiling water,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.330
it will jump out right away,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.063
but if you put it in lukewarm water,
and then slowly heat it up,

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:11.630
the frog won't survive.

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:16.330
The frog's big problem is that it lacks
the ability to rethink the situation.

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:19.463
It doesn’t realize that the warm bath
is becoming a death trap --

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:20.697
until it’s too late.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.297
Humans might be smarter than frogs,

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:26.497
but our world is full
of slow-boiling pots.

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:30.530
Think about how slow people were
to react to warnings about a pandemic,
