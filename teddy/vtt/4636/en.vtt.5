to study people who
are working for themselves,

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.537
and he ended up writing a book about them,

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.470
called "Free Agent Nation."

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.108

people with small start-ups,

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:53.170

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:55.744
to try to figure out what they were after.

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:57.875
AG: There's something
very meta about this.

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.423
It's like the "Seinfeld" episode

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:01.638
with the coffee table book
about coffee tables,
