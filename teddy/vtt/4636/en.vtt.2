(Music)

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.349
I'm Adam Grant, and this WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.821
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:15.113
I study how to make work not suck.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:16.767
In this show,

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.823
I'm inviting myself
into some truly unusual places,

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:22.922
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.278
Today: how to be your own best boss
and not your worst employee.

00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:31.932
