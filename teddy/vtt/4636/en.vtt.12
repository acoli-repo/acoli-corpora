She's a management professor
at the University of Michigan.

00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:06.415
She recently published a big study
that was inspired by her neighbor

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.827
who makes ceramics.

00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:11.346
SA: And I remember wondering,
"How does she do it?

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.759
How does she get herself up
on a dark, rainy day in January

00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:19.046
and go to her studio and do that work

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.181
when I'm struggling so much,

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:27.015
and yet there's a whole organization
waiting for me to come and so forth?

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.134
AG: If you work in an organization,

00:06:29.158 --> 00:06:31.732
you probably take for granted
all the simple structures
