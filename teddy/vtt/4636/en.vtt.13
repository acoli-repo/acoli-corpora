you probably take for granted
all the simple structures

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:33.308
that help you get work done.

00:06:33.941 --> 00:06:35.092
You have a schedule,

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:36.490
you have a workspace,

00:06:36.514 --> 00:06:39.116
you're surrounded by people
who are also working.

00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:42.504
Sue wanted to figure out
how people manage themselves

00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:44.610

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:47.424
So she studied independent workers
like her neighbor,

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:48.784
who are their own bosses.

00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.709
She interviewed artists
and software developers,

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:53.678
consultants and graphic designers,

00:06:53.702 --> 00:06:55.296
screenwriters and coaches.

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:59.343
SA: The freedom was both
wonderful and challenging.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.883
So now that I'm free to be anything,
what do I want to be?
