00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.883
So now that I'm free to be anything,
what do I want to be?

00:07:02.907 --> 00:07:05.849
Now that I'm free to work
in any way I want to work,

00:07:05.873 --> 00:07:07.398
how do I want to work?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.716
And they also loved having that freedom.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.269
Very few of them ever mentioned
yearning for an organization

00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:21.123
or wanting to change it
or go back to an organization.

00:07:21.544 --> 00:07:23.074
AG: Sue and her colleagues found

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:25.337
that independent workers
created four structures

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.816
to help them stay on track.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.552
The first structure was place:

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.748
finding a space
where they were productive.
