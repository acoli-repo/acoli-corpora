00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.254
and one of the happiest
occupations is entrepreneur.

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:04.755
DP: I think with entrepreneurs,

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.034
you have the autonomy,
you have the efficacy

00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:10.828
and you have some degree of purpose.

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.217
AG: You also get to choose where you work,

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:17.094
and one of the most popular choices
is working from home.

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.705
Take a recent experiment by economists.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.440
In call centers,

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:23.957
when people were randomly
assigned to work from home,

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.299
they were 13 percent more productive
and they were half as likely to quit.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.584
That's not just because
it saved them commuting time.
