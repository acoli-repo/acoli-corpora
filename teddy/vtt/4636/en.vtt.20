00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:01.565
you can structure it how you want --

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.269
these lessons apply to all of us.

AG: Dan Pink has been studying
self-management for years.

00:10:08.347 --> 00:10:10.677
He gets to test out the lessons
in his own work.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.716
When he's facing writer's block,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.435
one of his favorite steps
is to shift his perspective.

00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.228
He doesn't try to solve his problem.

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:21.020
Instead, he thinks about
what advice he would give

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:22.859
to someone else facing that problem.

00:10:23.358 --> 00:10:25.644
DP: What would I tell somebody
who I cared about,

00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:27.851
who's a good friend,
who's in the situation?

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:29.026
I'd say, "You know what?

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.215
Do one small thing.
