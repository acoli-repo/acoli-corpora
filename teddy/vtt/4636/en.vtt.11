00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:30.884
It was that feeling of saying,

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:32.285
"Holy crap.

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:34.777
I am not going to finish this thing.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.063
I cannot get it done."

00:05:36.087 --> 00:05:38.880
I'd never had that kind
of experience, ever, in my life,

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.317
and it was just ...

00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:41.937
it's like being possessed.

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.714
AG: When you're working for yourself,

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:48.381
you don't have a built-in team
to help you get unstuck,

00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:49.865
or a boss checking in on you.

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.354
You have to motivate yourself.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.201
SA: You know, we rail against our bosses,

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:57.566
but having a boss,
also, is a source of comfort.

00:05:58.142 --> 00:05:59.915
AG: That's that's Sue Ashford.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.707
She's a management professor
at the University of Michigan.
