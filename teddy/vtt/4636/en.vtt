00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:03.548
So I was working in real jobs
like a grownup human being,

00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:05.669
going to the office
and wearing fancy clothes

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.218
and doing those kinds of things,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:09.992
having bosses and getting
paychecks and things like that.

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.594
And after a certain time,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.330
Adam Grant: That's Dan Pink.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:15.979
He used to work in the White House

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.740
as the chief speech writer
to Vice President Al Gore.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.035
And although Dan liked his boss,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.881
he hated having a boss.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.883
DP: I like deciding what I'm going to do,

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:26.291
not being assigned something.

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.030
I like determining when I'm going
to come into the office,

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.400
not having someone else say,
