that run with the grain of human nature.

00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:37.775
AG: There's a workplace that goes
to the extreme on giving people freedom.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.466
So much freedom that they've run
successfully for decades

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.943
without a single boss.

00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:44.746
More on that after the break.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.066

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.705
I've played a personal role
in selecting the sponsors for this podcast

00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:55.349
because they all have interesting
cultures of their own.

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:58.035
Today we're going inside
the workplace at Bonobos.
