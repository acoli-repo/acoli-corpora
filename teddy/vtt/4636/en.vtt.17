00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:30.770
AG: The third structure
was ongoing interaction:

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:34.448
having conversations with people
who offered encouragement and direction.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:38.168
SA: Everybody talked about creating
some sort of connection.

00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:40.331
If you're a writer,
you talk to your editor.

00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:41.567
If you're a coach,

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:45.141
you had a fellow friend who was a coach.

00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:50.143
But what's interesting about it
is what functions those people played.

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:52.405
Part of it was affirmation --

00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:55.450
you know, "I think
this actually could work."

00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:57.685
AG: And the fourth structure was purpose:

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:01.228
reminding themselves why they were doing
this work in the first place.
