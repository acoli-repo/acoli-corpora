DP: I actually think that your son
is expressing human nature,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.922
and that our nature gets beaten out of us
by institutions and circumstance.

00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.156
You go anywhere in this world,
anywhere on this planet --

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.522
I defy you to find me a two-year-old
who is not self-directed and curious.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.055
AG: When you're your own boss,
you get to be self-directed.

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.938
You can choose what to work on,

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:53.820
how and when to do it
and who to collaborate with,

00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:57.169
which is one reason why surveys
often suggest that on average,

00:03:57.193 --> 00:03:59.852
the self-employed
are more satisfied with their jobs

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.254
and one of the happiest
occupations is entrepreneur.
