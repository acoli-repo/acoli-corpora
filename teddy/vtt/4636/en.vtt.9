That's not just because
it saved them commuting time.

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:34.712
DP: I think it's because they can fashion
the pieces of their life

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:36.636
in a way that works for them that day,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.809
and they're not taking
off-the-shelf solutions

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.116
from an HR department,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.199
and they're doing it
with some amount of liberty,

00:04:43.223 --> 00:04:46.145
and they're free from the gaze
of bosses and colleagues.

AG: If you have a traditional job,

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:51.158
being your own boss can sound
like a utopian fantasy.

00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:54.895
It's liberating,
but it can also be paralyzing.

00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:56.638
You lose your safety net.

00:04:57.208 --> 00:05:00.402
Your livelihood is riding
on your own ability to be productive
