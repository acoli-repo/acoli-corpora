00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.400
not having someone else say,

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:32.899
"We've got a meeting at 8:30,
you have to be there."

00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:35.400
I like saying, "This weekend,
I'm not going to work,"

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.539
rather than "This weekend,
you have to work."

00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:38.737
AG: So he quit.

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:42.556
And since then, Dan has been his own boss.

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:44.991
DP: It's always a struggle.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:46.345
I love having me as a boss;

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:48.144
I hate having me as an employee.

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:50.517
AG: Freedom is often a double-edged sword.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.474
But it doesn't have to be.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.466
There are better ways to be your own boss

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.926
whether you work for yourself
or for someone else.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.591
