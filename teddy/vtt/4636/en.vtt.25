There was one cleaner who would go
into rooms where patients were comatose

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:35.834
and rearrange the paintings on the walls.

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:38.223
AW: Though these patients are unconscious,

00:12:38.247 --> 00:12:40.533
maybe by changing something
in their environment,

00:12:40.557 --> 00:12:42.631
it could spark something --

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:45.549
maybe outside of any awareness
we might notice --

00:12:45.573 --> 00:12:49.653
that could spur on their healing
or spur on they recovery

00:12:49.677 --> 00:12:51.868
in a way that could make
a positive difference.

00:12:51.892 --> 00:12:54.449
We were curious about,
"Oh, is that part of your job

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:56.330
in this particular unit?"

00:12:56.354 --> 00:12:59.117
And the response she gave
was "No, it's not part of my job,

00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:00.450
but it's part of me."
