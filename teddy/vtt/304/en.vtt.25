00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And the benefit to the sponsors

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
That's our value proposition in a prize.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
or any kind of a new technology,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
you have to fund that from the beginning

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.
