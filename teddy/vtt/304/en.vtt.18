00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Well, people are going to die,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
how can you possibly going to put this forward?"

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and said, "Are you going to compete?" No.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I took a bet that someone would win.
