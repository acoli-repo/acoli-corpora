This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to go and be part of this amazing mission.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we knew nothing about going to space.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to going to the moon in eight years,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.
