00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Isn't that great? (Applause)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is going to be about 200,000.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I know if they don't do it, I am --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
we're going to stockpile some fuel,
