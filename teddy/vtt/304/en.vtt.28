00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And each of these areas was something that we found

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
of how to come up with prizes and write the rules,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and we're actually looking at creating prizes

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in a number of different categories.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and I'll talk about those more in a moment.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're going after an orbital prize.
