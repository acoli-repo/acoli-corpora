00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
anybody here fast in math?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I'll grant you that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But guys, if history has taught us anything,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I have no question that the physics,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the engineering to get us down to the point

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.
