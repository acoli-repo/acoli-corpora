00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
everything we hold of value on this planet --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.
