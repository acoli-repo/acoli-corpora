00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Let's go back to high school physics here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
anybody here fast in math?
