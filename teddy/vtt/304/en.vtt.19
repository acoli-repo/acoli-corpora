WEBVTT

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I took a bet that someone would win.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Applause)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We've had a lot of accomplishments

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and it's been a tremendous success.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is going to hang in Air and Space Museum,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Isn't that great? (Applause)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.
