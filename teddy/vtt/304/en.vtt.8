00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and clearly the industrial-military complex --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The ability for us to access these resources

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to gain planetary redundancy --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you know, everything stored on our databases,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and back them up off the planet,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.
