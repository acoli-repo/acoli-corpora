The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and while the probability is very small,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
the impact, figured in literally,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that to spend a small fraction looking, searching,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And of course, the third motivator,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.
