00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're going after an orbital prize.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We are looking at a number of energy prizes.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Craig Venter has just joined our board

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
we'll be announcing later this fall,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
it isn't money, it's only one thing --
