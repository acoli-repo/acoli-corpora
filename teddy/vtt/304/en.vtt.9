The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the moon, to Mars. And today,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --
