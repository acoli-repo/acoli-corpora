00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They didn't know what couldn't be done.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They had to make up everything.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.
