00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
there's a class of the nickel iron,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which in platinum-group metal markets alone

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
are worth something like 20 trillion dollars,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.
