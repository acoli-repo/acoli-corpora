00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
we should be allowed to risk.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.
