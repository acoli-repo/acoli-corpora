00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter) --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
concentrated in the hands of few individuals

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and the technology accessible

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that will allow us to really drive space exploration.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but how cheap could it get?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Let's go back to high school physics here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,
