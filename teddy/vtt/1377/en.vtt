00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I met a 12-year-old boy

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
who had been tortured

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and was denied access to counsel.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that for the hundreds of letters I had written

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for political prisoners, that I would never have

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
written a letter for him,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because he was not a 12-year-old boy who

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
had done something important for anybody.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He was not a political prisoner.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was a 12-year-old boy who had

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
stolen a bicycle.
