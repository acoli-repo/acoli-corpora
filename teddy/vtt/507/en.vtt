00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.953
It may seem like we're all standing
on solid earth right now,

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:05.350
but we're not.

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:10.150
The rocks and the dirt underneath us
are crisscrossed by tiny little fractures

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:11.573
and empty spaces.

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:16.526
And these empty spaces are filled
with astronomical quantities of microbes,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.817
such as these ones.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.229
The deepest that we found microbes
so far into the earth

00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:24.141
is five kilometers down.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.321
So like, if you pointed
yourself at the ground

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:28.664
and took off running into the ground,

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:32.359
you could run an entire 5K race
and microbes would line your whole path.
