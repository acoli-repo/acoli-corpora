00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
40 percent of all post-conflict situations,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Why has the record been so poor?
