00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.416
So our roads and our rail networks

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.616
have been designed to last for a long time

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.296
and withstand only
certain amounts of impacts

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.936
in different parts of the world.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.216
And this is going to be
extremely challenged.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.776
Our power stations
are expected to be cooled by water

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.560
to a certain temperature
to remain effective and resilient.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.136
And our buildings
are designed to be comfortable

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.376
within a particular temperature range.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.536
And this is all going to be
significantly challenged

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.816
under a four-degree-type scenario.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.640
Our infrastructure has not been
designed to cope with this.
