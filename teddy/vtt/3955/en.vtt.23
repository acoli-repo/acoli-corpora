00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.680
it means that if our economies grow,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720
then so do our emissions.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.336
So I'd just like to take
a quote from a paper

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.760
by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.480
where we said that to avoid the two-degree
framing of dangerous climate change,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.216
economic growth needs to be exchanged
at least temporarily

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.640
for a period of planned austerity
in wealthy nations.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.400
This is a really difficult
message to take,
