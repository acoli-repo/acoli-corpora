We can either choose to start
to take climate change seriously,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.896
and significantly cut and mitigate
our greenhouse gas emissions,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
and then we will have to adapt to less
of the climate change impacts in future.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.960
Alternatively, we can continue to really
ignore the climate change problem.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.336
But if we do that, we are also choosing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.880
to adapt to very much more powerful
climate impacts in future.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.536
And not only that.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.936
As people who live in countries
with high per capita emissions,
