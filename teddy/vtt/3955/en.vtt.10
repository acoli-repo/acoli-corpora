00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.816
Now imagine that same day --

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.440
but it's six, eight,
maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520
on that day during that heat wave.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.254
That's the kind of thing
we're going to experience

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.318
under a four-degree global
average temperature scenario.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.736
And the problem with these extremes,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.576
and not just the temperature extremes,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.656
but also the extremes in terms of storms
and other climate impacts,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.160
is our infrastructure is just not set up
to deal with these sorts of events.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.416
So our roads and our rail networks
