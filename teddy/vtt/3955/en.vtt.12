00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.640
Our infrastructure has not been
designed to cope with this.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.296
So if we go back, also thinking
about four degrees,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.296
it's not just the direct impacts,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.320
but also some indirect impacts.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.520
So if we take food security, for example.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.760
Maize and wheat yields

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.816
in some parts of the world

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.800
are expected to be up to 40 percent lower

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.216
under a four-degree scenario,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.840
rice up to 30 percent lower.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.680
This will be absolutely devastating
for global food security.
