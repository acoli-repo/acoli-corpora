00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.640
to the two-degree
green pathway is immediate.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.016
And that's because
of cumulative emissions,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.616
or the carbon budget.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.296
So in other words, because
of the lights and the projectors

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.016
that are on in this room right now,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.993
the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:47.337
as a result of that
electricity consumption

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.176
lasts a very long time.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.216
Some of it will be in our atmosphere
for a century, maybe much longer.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.960
It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases
tend to be cumulative.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.576
And that tells us something
about these trajectories.
