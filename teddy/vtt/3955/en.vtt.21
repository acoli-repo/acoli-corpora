00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.896
And now, if we're all constrained
by the same amount of carbon budget,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.456
that means that if some parts of
the world's emissions are needing to rise,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.160
then other parts of the world's
emissions need to reduce.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.160
So that poses very significant challenges
for wealthy nations.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.360
Because according to our research,

00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:51.896
if you're in a country where per capita
emissions are really high --

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.360
so North America, Europe, Australia --

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.136
emissions reductions of the order
of 10 percent per year,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.216
and starting immediately,
will be required for a good chance
