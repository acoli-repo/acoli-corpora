00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.616
And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.456
And all the way through,
during all of these meetings

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.040

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.640
emissions have continued to rise.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.136
And if we focus on our historical

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.376
and we put that together
with our understanding
