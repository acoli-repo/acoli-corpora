00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.480
then we will have to do that even sooner.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.960
So this poses really big
challenges for us.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.200
The other thing it does is tells us
something about energy policy.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.696
If you live in a part of the world where
per capita emissions are already high,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.160
it points us towards
reducing energy demand.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.136
And that's because
with all the will in the world,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.696
the large-scale engineering infrastructure

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.856
that we need to roll out rapidly

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.976
to decarbonize the supply side
of our energy system

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240
is just simply not going
to happen in time.
