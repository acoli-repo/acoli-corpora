00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240
is just simply not going
to happen in time.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.136
So it doesn't matter
whether we choose nuclear power

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.016
or carbon capture and storage,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.376
upscale our biofuel production,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.616
or go for a much bigger roll-out
of wind turbines and wave turbines.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.280
All of that will take time.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.256
So because it's the area
under the curve that matters,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.216
we need to focus on energy efficiency,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.760
but also on energy conservation --
in other words, using less energy.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.416
And if we do that, that also means

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.080
that as we continue to roll out
the supply-side technology,

00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:02.096
we will have less of a job to do
if we've actually managed
