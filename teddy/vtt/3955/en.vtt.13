00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.616
So all in all, the kinds
of impacts anticipated

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.400
under this four-degree centigrade scenario

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.680
are going to be incompatible
with global organized living.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.800
So back to our trajectories and our graphs
of four degrees and two degrees.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.400
Is it reasonable still
to focus on the two-degree path?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.736
There are quite a lot of my colleagues
and other scientists

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.080
who would say that it's now too late
to avoid a two-degree warming.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:02.096
But I would just like
to draw on my own research
