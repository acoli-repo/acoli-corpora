Over our lifetimes,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.120
we've all contributed to climate change.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.456
Actions, choices and behaviors

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.360
will have led to an increase
in greenhouse gas emissions.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.176
And I think that that's
quite a powerful thought.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.616
But it does have the potential
to make us feel guilty

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.416
when we think about decisions
we might have made

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.936
around where to travel to,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960
how often and how,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.296
about the energy that we choose to use
