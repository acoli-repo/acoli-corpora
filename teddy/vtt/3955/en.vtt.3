As people who live in countries
with high per capita emissions,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.360
we're making that choice
on behalf of others as well.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.096
But the choice that we don't have

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.440
is a no climate change future.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.256
Over the last two decades,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.136
our government negotiators
and policymakers have been coming together

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.080
to discuss climate change,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.856
and they've been focused on
avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.680

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.096
That's the temperature that's associated
with dangerous impacts
