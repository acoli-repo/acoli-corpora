00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:02.096
But I would just like
to draw on my own research

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.176
on energy systems, on food systems,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.040
aviation and also shipping,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.656
just to say that I think there is still
a small fighting chance

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.296
of avoiding this two-degree
dangerous climate change.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.701
But we really need
to get to grips with the numbers

00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:18.925
to work out how to do it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640
So if you focus in on this trajectory
and these graphs,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.056
the yellow circle there
highlights that the departure

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.576
from the red four-degree pathway

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.640
to the two-degree
green pathway is immediate.
