00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.576
And that tells us something
about these trajectories.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.616
First of all, it tells us that it's
the area under these curves that matter,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.616
not where we reach
at a particular date in future.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.831
And that's important,
because it doesn't matter

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:12.656
if we come up with some amazing
whiz-bang technology

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.536
to sort out our energy problem
on the last day of 2049,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.856
just in the nick of time
to sort things out.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.000
Because in the meantime,
emissions will have accumulated.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.800
So if we continue on this red,
four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.216
the longer we continue on it,
