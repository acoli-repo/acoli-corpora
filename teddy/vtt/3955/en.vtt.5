It can cause upset, it could cause cost.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.160
It could even cause some deaths.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.096
But if that exact same weather event
happens in a part of the world

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.136
where there is poor infrastructure,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.376
or where people are not well-insured,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.816
or they're not having
good support networks,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.880
then that same climate change impact
could be devastating.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.856
It could cause a significant loss of home,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.880
but it could also cause
significant amounts of death.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.776
So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions
at the left-hand side

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.616
from fossil fuel and industry,
