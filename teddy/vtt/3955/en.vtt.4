00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.096
That's the temperature that's associated
with dangerous impacts

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.720
across a range of different indicators,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.736
to humans and to the environment.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.919
So two degrees centigrade
constitutes dangerous climate change.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.736
But dangerous climate change
can be subjective.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.056
So if we think about
an extreme weather event

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.128
that might happen
in some part of the world,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.416
and if that happens in a part of the world
where there is good infrastructure,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.200
where there are people
that are well-insured and so on,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.136
then that impact can be disruptive.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.416
It can cause upset, it could cause cost.
