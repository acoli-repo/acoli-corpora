00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.216
the longer we continue on it,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.616
that will need to be
made up for in later years

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.480
to keep the same carbon budget,
to keep the same area under the curve,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.056
which means that that trajectory,
the red one there, becomes steeper.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.816
So in other words, if we don't reduce
emissions in the short to medium term,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.560
then we'll have to make more significant
year-on-year emission reductions.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.760
We also know that we have
to decarbonize our energy system.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.096
But if we don't start to cut
emissions in the short to medium term,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.480
then we will have to do that even sooner.
