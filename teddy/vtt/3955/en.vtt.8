00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.376
and we put that together
with our understanding

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.880
of the direction of travel
in our global economy,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.016
then we are much more on track

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.040
for a four-degree centigrade
global warming

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680
than we are for the two-degree centigrade.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.136
Now, let's just pause for a moment

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.959
and think about this four-degree
global average temperature.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.760
Most of our planet
is actually made up of the sea.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.880
Now, because the sea has a greater
thermal inertia than the land,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.656
the average temperatures over land
are actually going to be higher

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.200
than they are over the sea.
