Imagine an airplane flying
one millimeter above the ground

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:13.371
and circling the Earth
once every 25 seconds

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:17.079
while counting every blade of grass.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.121
Shrink all that down so that it fits
in the palm of your hand,

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:24.038
and you'd have something equivalent
to a modern hard drive,

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.454
an object that can likely hold
more information than your local library.

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:33.287
So how does it store so much information
in such a small space?
