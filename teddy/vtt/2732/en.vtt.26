00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.298
will have given us better ways
to manage global conflict.

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:06.933
Surely, if ever there was a global
moon shot worth supporting,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:08.941
this is it.

00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:12.460
Now, in the face of real threats --

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:15.480
for instance, North Korea's recent
nuclear weapons tests,

00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:17.784
which fly in the face of sanctions --

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:20.108
reasonable people disagree

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:24.031
about whether we should maintain
some number of nuclear weapons

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.582
to deter aggression.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.454
But the question is:
What's the magic number?
