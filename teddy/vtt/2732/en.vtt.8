(Applause)

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:03.368
This is really crucial right now,

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:06.179
because nuclear weapons --
they're vulnerable.

00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:08.861
We have solid evidence

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.775
that terrorists are trying
to get ahold of them.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.872
Just this last spring,

00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:18.602
when four retirees
and two taxi drivers were arrested

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.225
in the Republic of Georgia

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.974
for trying to sell nuclear materials
for 200 million dollars,

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:27.766
they demonstrated that the black market
for this stuff is alive and well.

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.372
And it's really important,

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:33.193
because there have been
dozens of accidents
