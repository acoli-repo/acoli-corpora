00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:31.601
Is it a thousand?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.621
Is it a hundred? Ten?

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:36.673
And then we have to ask:

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.352
Who should be responsible for them?

00:13:40.038 --> 00:13:41.896
I think we can agree, however,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.969
that having 15,000 of them
represents a greater global threat

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.374
to Jasmine's generation than a promise.

00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:52.342
So it's time we make a promise

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:55.079
of a world in which we've broken
the stranglehold

00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:58.601
that nuclear weapons have
on our imaginations;

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.237
in which we invest
in the creative solutions
