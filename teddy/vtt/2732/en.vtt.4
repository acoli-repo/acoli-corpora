00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.458
and I'm going to talk
about my imaginary friend,

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.268
who I like to think of as Jasmine,

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.638
just for a moment.

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:08.179
Jasmine, at the age of 25,

00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:12.558
is part of a generation that is more
politically and socially engaged

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:14.987
than anything we've seen in 50 years.

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:16.950
She and her friends think of themselves

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.223
as change agents
and leaders and activists.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:23.389
I think of them as Generation Possible.

00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:27.398
They regularly protest
about the issues they care about,

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:30.830
but nuclear weapons are not one of them,
which makes sense,
