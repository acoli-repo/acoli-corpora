there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:12.934
That's when Russian radar technicians saw

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.498
collecting data about the northern lights.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:24.676
But at that time,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.471
Russian President Boris Yeltsin

retaliatory nuclear attack
