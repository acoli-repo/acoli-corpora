00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:31.865
So it's time to commit to a date.

00:12:33.183 --> 00:12:36.711
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:39.920
on the 100th anniversary of its inception.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:45.845
After all, by 2045, we will have held
billions of people hostage

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.143
to the threat of nuclear annihilation.

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.433
Surely, 100 years will have been enough.

00:12:51.512 --> 00:12:55.191
Surely, a century of economic development

00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:58.610
and the development of military strategy

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.298
will have given us better ways
to manage global conflict.
