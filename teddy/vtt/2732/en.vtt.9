00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:33.193
because there have been
dozens of accidents

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:34.498
involving nuclear weapons,

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:37.563
and I bet most of us have never heard
anything about them.

00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:39.129
Just here in the United States,

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:42.651
we've dropped nuclear weapons
on the Carolinas twice.

00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.529
In one case, one of the bombs,

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:47.725
which fell out of an Air Force plane,

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:48.948
didn't detonate

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.085
because the nuclear core
was stored somewhere else on the plane.

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:56.145
In another case, the weapon
did arm when it hit the ground,

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.340
and five of the switches designed
to keep it from detonating failed.
