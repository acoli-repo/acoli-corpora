about the size of your morning latte

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.615

Hundreds of thousands of others
would become horribly ill,

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:43.641
and parts of the city
would be uninhabitable for years,

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.556
But you can forget that nuclear latte,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.550

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:04.210
And even a limited nuclear war
involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,
