00:11:29.358 --> 00:11:32.055
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:36.352
who has been campaigning
to make nuclear weapons illegal

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:38.060
in international courts of law,

00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:40.976
and just won a big victory
at the UN last week.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.178
(Applause)

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:45.416
And yet,

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.131
and yet,

00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:51.215
with all of our talk in this culture
about moon shots,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:55.967
too few members of Generation Possible
and those of us who mentor them

00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.957
are taking on nuclear weapons.

00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:00.461
It's as if there's a taboo.
