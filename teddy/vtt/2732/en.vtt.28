00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.237
in which we invest
in the creative solutions

00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:04.991
that come from working backward
from the future we desperately want,

00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:07.549
rather than plodding forward
from a present

00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:11.933
that brings all of the mental models
and biases of the past with it.

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:17.694
It's time we pledge our resources
as leaders across the spectrum

00:14:17.718 --> 00:14:20.607
to work on this old problem in new ways,

00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:23.231
to ask, "How might we?"

00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:26.304
How might we make good on a promise

00:14:26.328 --> 00:14:29.905
of greater security
for Jasmine's generation

00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:32.894
in a world beyond nuclear weapons?
