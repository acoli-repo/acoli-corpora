Let me ask you all a question.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:08.146
How much weapons-grade nuclear
material do you think it would take

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.929
to level a city the size of San Francisco?

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:13.586
How many of you think
it would be an amount

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.994
about the size of this suitcase?

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.851
OK. And how about this minibus?

00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:23.480
All right.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.198
Well actually, under
the right circumstances,

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:31.673
an amount of highly enriched uranium
about the size of your morning latte
