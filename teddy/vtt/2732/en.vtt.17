00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.702
some experts tell me would take 30 years.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.686
It would take a renaissance of sorts,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.125
the kinds of innovation that,
for better or worse,

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:40.123
underpinned both the Manhattan Project,
which gave rise to nuclear weapons,

00:08:40.147 --> 00:08:42.559
and the Megatons to Megawatts program.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:45.641
It would take design constraints.

00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:48.383
These are fundamental to creativity,

00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:52.423
things like a platform
for international collaboration;

00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:56.139
a date certain, which is
a forcing mechanism;

00:08:56.925 --> 00:09:00.174
and a positive vision
that inspires action.
