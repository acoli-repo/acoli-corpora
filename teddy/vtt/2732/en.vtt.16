by former Russian warheads.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.301
So, together these two nations
did something truly audacious.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:15.974
But the good news is,
the global community has the chance

00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:19.000
to do something just as audacious today.

00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:23.424
To get rid of nuclear weapons

00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:27.986

required to produce them,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.702
some experts tell me would take 30 years.
