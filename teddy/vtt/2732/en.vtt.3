In fact, if you live in any
of the rural areas

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:33.920
where nuclear weapons are stored globally,

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:35.567

About 1,800 of these weapons
are on high alert,

for just a second,

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.458
and I'm going to talk
about my imaginary friend,
