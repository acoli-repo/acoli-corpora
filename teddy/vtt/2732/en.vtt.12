00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:02.692
sets no specific date by which
the world's nuclear-armed nations

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:04.923
will get rid of their nuclear weapons.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:08.462
Now, when John F. Kennedy
sent a man to the moon

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.657
and decided to bring him back,
or decided to do both those things,

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.601
he didn't say, "Hey, whenever
you guys get to it."

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.632
He gave us a deadline.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.478
He gave us a challenge

00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:22.009
that would have been incredible
just a few years earlier.

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:23.535
And with that challenge,

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.434
he inspired scientists and marketers,

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:29.128
astronauts and schoolteachers.

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:31.185
He gave us a vision.
