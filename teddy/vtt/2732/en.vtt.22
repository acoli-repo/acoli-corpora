00:10:57.175 --> 00:11:02.398
Now, every day, I get to meet
people who are real pioneers

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:04.339
in the field of nuclear threats.

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:07.864
As you can see, many of them
are young women,

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:10.464
and they're doing fiercely
interesting stuff,

00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:14.991
like Mareena Robinson Snowden here,
who is developing new ways,

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:17.677
better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,

00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.924
which will help us
overcome a critical hurdle

00:11:19.948 --> 00:11:21.882
to international disarmament.

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.775
Or Melissa Hanham, who is using
satellite imaging

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:28.904
to make sense of what's going on
around far-flung nuclear sites.

00:11:29.358 --> 00:11:32.055
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,
