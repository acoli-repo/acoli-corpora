00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:41.789
She never had to duck and cover
under her desk at school.

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:46.104
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter
is an app in the Android store.

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:48.823
Nuclear weapons help win games.

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:51.281
And that is really a shame,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.579

00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:58.894
to help us make some really important
decisions about nuclear weapons.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:05.981
For instance, will we further reduce
our nuclear arsenals globally,
