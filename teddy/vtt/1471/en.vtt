00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:04.386
There are 39 million people in the world

00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:05.876
who are blind.

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:08.350
Eighty percent of them

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.169
are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.118
and the absolute majority

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.625
do not need to be blind.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.480
They are blind from diseases

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.256
that are either completely curable or preventable.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.768
Knowing this, with my young family,

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:24.162
we moved to Kenya.

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.969
We secured equipment,

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.668
funds, vehicles, we trained a team,

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:31.692
we set up a hundred clinics throughout
