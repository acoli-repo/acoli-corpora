Around the globe,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.246
there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.561
to escape war, violence, and persecution.

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.818
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons,

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:25.884
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries.

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:31.028
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries.
