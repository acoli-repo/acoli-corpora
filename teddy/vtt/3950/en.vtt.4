Naughty Umm El-Saad.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:09.121
Of course, that's not why
Umm El-Saad joined the program.

00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:13.871
I saw how she was longing to gain
control over her simple daily routines,

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.746
small details that we take for granted,

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:19.954
from counting money at the market
to helping her kids in homework.

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.954

and her community's mindset,

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:25.038
which belittles women's education,

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:27.746
Umm El-Saad, along with
her Egyptian classmates,

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.996
was eager to learn how to read and write.
