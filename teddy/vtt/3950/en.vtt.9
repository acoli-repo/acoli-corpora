00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.204
And here I would like to end
with a quote by Yasmine,

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:33.454
one of the four activist women
I interviewed in Tunisia.

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:35.038
Yasmine wrote,

00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:37.413
"Question your convictions.

00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:41.163
Be who you to want to be,
not who they want you to be.

00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:44.746
Don't accept their enslavement,
for your mother birthed you free."

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:46.954
Thank you.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:51.038
