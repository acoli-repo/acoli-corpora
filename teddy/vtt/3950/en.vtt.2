00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:01.079
it was not always easy 
to convince the women to participate.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.996
Only after explaining to them

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.829
how their stories
might influence other women's lives,

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.663
how they would become role models
for their own community, did some agree.

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:13.829
Seeking a collaborative
and reflexive approach,

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.038
I asked them to write
their own words and ideas

00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:19.246
on prints of their own images.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.079
Those images were then shared
in some of the classrooms,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.329
and worked to inspire
and motivate other women

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.413
going through similar educations 
and situations.
