00:00:00.663 --> 00:00:02.787
As an Arab female photographer,

00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:07.913
I have always found ample inspiration
for my projects in personal experiences.

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:09.829
The passion I developed for knowledge,

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.246
which allowed me to break barriers
towards a better life

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.579
was the motivation 
for my project I Read I Write.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.329
Pushed by my own experience,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.288
as I was not allowed initially
to pursue my higher education,

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:27.496
I decided to explore and document
stories of other women

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:30.329
who changed their lives through education,
