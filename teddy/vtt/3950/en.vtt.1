who changed their lives through education,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.162
while exposing and questioning
the barriers they face.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:37.829
I covered a range of topics
that concern women's education,

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.454
keeping in mind the differences
among Arab countries

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.579
due to economic and social factors.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.746
These issues include female illiteracy,
which is quite high in the region;

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:52.121
educational reforms;
programs for dropout students;

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:55.204
and political activism
among university students.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.496
As I started this work,

00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:01.079
it was not always easy 
to convince the women to participate.
