Just like the women I photographed,

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:08.871
I had to overcome many barriers
to becoming the photographer I am today,

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:12.621
many people along the way
telling me what I can and cannot do.

00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:18.704
Umm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza,
and many women across the Arab world,

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:22.663
show that it is possible
to overcome barriers to education,

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:25.913
which they know is the best means
to a better future.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.204
