Aisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.246
"I sought education in order
to be independent

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.538
and to not count on men with everything."

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:43.371
One of my first subjects
was Umm El-Saad from Egypt.

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.788
When we first met, she was
barely able to write her name.

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:49.038
She was attending
a nine-month literacy program

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:51.996
run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:54.204
Months later, she was joking
that her husband

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:56.746
had threatened to pull her
out of the classes,

00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:58.996
as he found out that his now literate wife

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:01.788
was going through his phone text messages.
