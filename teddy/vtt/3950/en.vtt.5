In Tunisia, I met Asma,

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:37.788
one of the four activist women
I interviewed.

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:41.163
The secular bioengineering student
is quite active on social media.

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:47.913
Regarding her country, which treasured
what has been called the Arab Spring,

00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:50.829
she said, "I've always dreamt
of discovering a new bacteria.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.579
Now, after the revolution,
we have a new one every single day."

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.163
Asma was referring to the rise
of religious fundamentalism in the region,

00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:02.246
which is another obstacle
to women in particular.
