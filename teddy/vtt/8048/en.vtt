When I think about the rise of AI,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.170
I'm reminded by the rise of literacy.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.421
A few hundred years ago,

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.006
many people in society thought

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:13.968
that maybe not everyone needed
to be able to read and write.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.929
Back then, many people were
tending fields or herding sheep,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.599
so maybe there was less need
for written communication.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.808
And all that was needed

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.227
was for the high priests
and priestesses and monks

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.854
to be able to read the Holy Book,

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:27.774
and the rest of us could just go
to the temple or church

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:28.941
or the holy building

00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:32.361
and sit and listen to the high priest
and priestesses read to us.
