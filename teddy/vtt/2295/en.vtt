00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and so on. And within the last decade or two,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
underlying many of these past collapses.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But there were also plenty of places in the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where societies have been developing for thousands of years
