and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and to no government regulation; values that worked well

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
