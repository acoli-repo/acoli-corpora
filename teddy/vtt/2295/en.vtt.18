What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
about a society today, you should be looking not at the value

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as
