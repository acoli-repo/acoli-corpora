00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are more fragile than others. And then finally,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
another generalization. I'm now teaching a course

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,
