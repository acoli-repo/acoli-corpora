This is a European society with literate records,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and every one of them ended up dead.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,
