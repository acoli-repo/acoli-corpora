00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the most devastating case of complete deforestation?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
