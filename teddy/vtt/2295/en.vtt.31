for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about the world's environmental problems?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is to forget about there being any single thing that is

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
the most important thing we need to do.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,
