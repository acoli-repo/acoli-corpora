their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,
