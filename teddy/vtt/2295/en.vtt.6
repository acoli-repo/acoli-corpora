00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --
