00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are able to insulate themselves from the consequences

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
