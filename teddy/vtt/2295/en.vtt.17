00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, this is a frequent theme:

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned
