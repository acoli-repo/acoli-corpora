some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What about ourselves?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Obviously the answer to this question is not going

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away
