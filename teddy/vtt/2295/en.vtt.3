00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a European society with literate records,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
