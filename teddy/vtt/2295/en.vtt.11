00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
from salinization, problems of forest management,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of
