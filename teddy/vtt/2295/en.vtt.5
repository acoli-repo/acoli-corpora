00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
which was a particular problem for them because

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate
