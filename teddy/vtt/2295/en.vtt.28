and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in this remote outpost of European civilization

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
for 250 years has been their British identity.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
But today, their commitment to a British identity

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to change course when the things that get you in trouble

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
are the things that are also the source of your strength.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What's going to be the outcome today?
