But there were also plenty of places in the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where societies have been developing for thousands of years

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
without any sign of a major collapse,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to our situation today, because today as well, there are

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia
