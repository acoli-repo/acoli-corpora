00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
after their peak, they collapse. For example,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.
