00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.581
and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer,

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:33.720
its speed, the density of the fluid,

00:01:33.744 --> 00:01:36.494
and the stickiness,
or the viscosity, of the fluid.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.718
What this means is that creatures
of very different sizes

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.715
inhabit vastly different worlds.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.684
For example, because of its huge size,

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:48.001
a sperm whale inhabits
the large Reynolds number world.

00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:50.105
If it flaps its tail once,

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.486
it can coast ahead
for an incredible distance.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.184
Meanwhile, sperm live
in a low Reynolds number world.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.357
If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail,

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.912
it wouldn't even coast past a single atom.
