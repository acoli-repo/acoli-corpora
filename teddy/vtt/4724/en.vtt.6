00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.968
converts winding motion
into forward motion,

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:04.805
these tiny creatures
spin their helical tails

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.603
to push themselves forward

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:10.360
in a world where water
feels as thick as cork.

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:12.485
Other strategies are even stranger.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.507
Some bacteria take Batman's approach.

00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:17.227
They use grappling hooks
to pull themselves along.

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.013
They can even use this grappling hook

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:21.743
like a sling shot
and fling themselves forward.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.195
Others use chemical engineering.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.485
H. pylori lives only
in the slimy, acidic mucus

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.234
inside our stomachs.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.697
It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus,
