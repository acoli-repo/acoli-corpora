Microscopic creatures inhabit
a world alien to us,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.699
where making it through an inch of water
is an incredible endeavor.

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:37.717
But why does size matter
so much for a swimmer?

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.741
What makes the world of a sperm
so fundamentally different

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.597
from that of a sperm whale?

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:46.079
To find out, we need to dive
into the physics of fluids.

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:47.931
Here's a way to think about it.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:49.831
Imagine you are swimming in a pool.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.594
It's you and a whole bunch
of water molecules.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:57.128
Water molecules outnumber you
a thousand trillion trillion to one.

00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:00.502
So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy,
