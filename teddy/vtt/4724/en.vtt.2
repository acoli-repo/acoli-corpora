00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:00.502
So, pushing past them
with your gigantic body is easy,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.688
but if you were really small,

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:05.068
say you were about the size
of a water molecule,

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.107
all of a sudden, it's like you're swimming

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.235
in a pool of people.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.575
Rather than simply swishing by
all the teeny, tiny molecules,

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.533
now every single water molecule

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:16.045
is like another person
you have to push past

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.354
to get anywhere.

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:20.955
In 1883, the physicist Osborne Reynolds

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.078
figured out that there is
one simple number

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:25.992
that can predict how a fluid will behave.

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:27.540
It's called the Reynolds number,

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:31.581
and it depends on simple properties
like the size of the swimmer,
