00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.912
it wouldn't even coast past a single atom.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.607
To imagine what it would
feel like to be a sperm,

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:06.270
you need to bring yourself down
to its Reynolds number.

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:09.154
Picture yourself in a tub of molasses
with your arms moving

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:12.118
about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock,

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:15.590
and you'd have a pretty good idea
of what a sperm is up against.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.825
So, how do microbes
manage to get anywhere?

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.162
Well, many don't bother swimming at all.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:22.772
They just let the food drift to them.

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:24.320
This is somewhat like a lazy cow

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.049
that waits for the grass
under its mouth to grow back.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:29.017
But many microbes do swim,

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.985
and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in.
