00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.985
and this is where those
incredible adaptations come in.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.803
One trick they can use
is to deform the shape of their paddle.

00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:37.526
By cleverly flexing their paddle

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.401
to create more drag on the power stroke
than on the recovery stroke,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:44.916
single-celled organisms like paramecia

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.845
manage to inch their way
through the crowd of water molecules.

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.907
But there's an even more
ingenious solution

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.278
arrived at by bacteria and sperm.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.215
Instead of wagging
their paddles back and forth,

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.335
they wind them like a cork screw.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.182
Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.968
converts winding motion
into forward motion,
