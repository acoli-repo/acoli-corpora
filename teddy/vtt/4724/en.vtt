In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:14.174
calculated that if you push
a bacteria and then let go,

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.923

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:21.149
In that time, it will have traveled less
than the width of a single atom.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.640
The same holds true for a sperm

It all has to do with being really small.
