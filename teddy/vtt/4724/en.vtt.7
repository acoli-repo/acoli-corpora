00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.697
It releases a chemical
that thins out the surrounding mucus,

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.650
allowing it to glide through slime.

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:35.722
Maybe it's no surprise

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:38.883
that these guys are also responsible
for stomach ulcers.

00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:43.090
So, when you look really closely
at our bodies and the world around us,

00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:45.088
you can see all sorts of tiny creatures

00:03:45.112 --> 00:03:48.957
finding clever ways to get around
in a sticky situation.

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.602
Without these adaptations,
bacteria would never find their hosts,

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:55.581
and sperms would never
make it to their eggs,

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.938
which means you would never
get stomach ulcers,

00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:00.462
but you would also never be born
in the first place.
