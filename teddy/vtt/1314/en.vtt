So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is 26th, that's 27th."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Streets have names; blocks are just the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
unnamed spaces in between streets."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,
