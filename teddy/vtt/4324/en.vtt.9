00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:33.870
And after a few months,
we had the first test run with the system.

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:38.195
It worked brilliantly
from the first test on,

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.536
and it had the same resolution
as systems which cost 60,000 euros,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.640
and we only spent 1,500 euros
for the system,

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:51.620
not including my salary,

00:04:51.644 --> 00:04:54.355
but that wouldn't add so much on its own.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.797
(Laughter)

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.639
OK, how does this work?

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.164
I brought you a video

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:04.053
where you can see how you can put
in your three-dimensional file.
