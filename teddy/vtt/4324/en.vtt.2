00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:03.571
and this is a very expensive,
not very durable laser system. (Laughs)

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:08.453
And on the other hand, you need
a very complex positioning system.

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:12.064
We call it "Agathe,"
because it's very heavy,

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.393
and we thought Agathe was a nice name.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:15.567
(Laughter)

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.198
And, well, you need this system
to move the laser through,

00:01:20.222 --> 00:01:24.103
for example, at the very accurate
level, about 200 nanometers,

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:25.286
so very accurate.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.793
And, well, what can you do with that?

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.124
You can do things
that you cannot see with your eyes.
