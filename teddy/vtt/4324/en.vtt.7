00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:30.814
Then I noticed, OK, there is a major
issue with the pump source.

00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:34.230
I cannot fix that myself; we have to call
the service technician.

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:37.741
And from that point on,
I noticed I had time to think.

00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:42.122
So I thought, "What to do now?
Maybe start to write my PhD thesis."

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:44.459
(Laughter)

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:46.972
No, no, not a good idea at all.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:51.588
So I started thinking, maybe
write a scientific paper.

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:53.144
Not a good idea at all.

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:57.090
And then, on Saturday,
after a week of thinking,

00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:58.480
I came up with the idea

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.624
to build the smallest
3-D microprinter in the world.
