WEBVTT

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.729
and we catch a living animal,

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:33.447
here, a special worm.

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:37.282
What we're trying to do,
or what the next step would be,

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:43.874
is to make biocompatible polymers
and maybe to write some things

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:47.150
inside your body
or inside the body of a worm,

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:52.079
or to attach cells
to our structures, and so on.

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:55.237
But, OK, that's my normal working field.

00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:59.679
Today I want to tell the story
behind the microprinter.

00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.438
What was my motivation?
