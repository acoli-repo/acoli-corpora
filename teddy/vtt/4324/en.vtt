Hello everybody,
thanks for having me today.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.865
I'm a little bit injured,

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:09.181
but it takes more than a car
to stop me from talking to you.

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.721
(Laughter)

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.912
(Applause)

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:16.208
Maybe a tank?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.020
So today, I want to talk
about the microprinter,

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:24.838
about my work, how everything started,

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.583
what was my motivation to build
the smallest 3-D printer in the world.
