00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:04.053
where you can see how you can put
in your three-dimensional file.

00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:09.160
This video was produced
by a friend of mine, Junior Veloso.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.950
And you can see, you have
a set stage which moves up.

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:15.483
And under the set stage,
there is a liquid,

00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:18.511
which gets solidified by the light.

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:23.600
And slice by slice, you create the model,

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:29.586
so you really pull it out of the liquid.
