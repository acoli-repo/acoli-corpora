00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.560
Maybe you have 100 slices,

So that's how it works.

00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:43.542
Of course, this is a much bigger machine
than the microprinter,

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:46.181
but it uses more or less
the same principles,

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:48.425
so that's what I want to show you.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.721
At the end, this head, this alien head,

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:53.906
is attached to the building platform,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.138
and when the process is done,
you just simply have to break the head
