00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.583
what was my motivation to build
the smallest 3-D printer in the world.

00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:33.926
Let's start with my daily business.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.281
So, my normal working field is called
two-photon polymerization.

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.369
It sounds very nerdy, it is very nerdy.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:43.712
(Laughter)

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.801
What do you need for making this stuff?

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.025
You need a complex laser system,

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.367
a so-called femtosecond laser system,

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:57.854
which you focus onto a very tiny spot --
very, very, very tiny --

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:03.571
and this is a very expensive,
not very durable laser system. (Laughs)
