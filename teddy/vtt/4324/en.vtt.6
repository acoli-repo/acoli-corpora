00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.438
What was my motivation?

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:06.001
Well, everything started
on Monday morning, 6:30.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.223
OK, that's a lie. Maybe it was 10 o'clock.

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.264
(Laughter)

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:15.255
I went to my laser lab, which is located
near Karlsplatz, in Freihaus,

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.709
at the Vienna University of Technology.

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:21.697
I went in, and I saw
that this laser system was broken,

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.044
and I tried to fix it.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.510
It took me half a day, several hours.

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:30.814
Then I noticed, OK, there is a major
issue with the pump source.
