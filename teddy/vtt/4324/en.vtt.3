You can do things
that you cannot see with your eyes.

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:33.516
So you can print out whatever you want,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.859
you can print out a tower bridge,
you can print out Agathe's husband ...

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:40.311
(Laughter)

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:47.210
OK, but, what makes it so mind-blowing?

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:53.610
You maybe notice this scale bar,
and it's 100 microns for the tower bridge

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.017
and 20 microns for the fat man.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:00.672
For comparison, the diameter
of a human hair is around 50 microns.
