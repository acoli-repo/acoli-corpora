00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.624
to build the smallest
3-D microprinter in the world.

00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:03.023
(Laughter)

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:05.322
Or, the smallest 3-D printer in the world.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:08.719
(Applause)

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.412
So I called my professor
and told him about it.

00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:17.169
"Hey, let's build the thing!
I have time. Is it OK?"

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:18.352
"Go ahead, build it."

00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:21.813
And so I went to the university,
and from that point on,

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:25.092
I just put everything out of my brain
inside the computer

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:28.587
to make this CAD construction
of the whole thing.

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:33.870
And after a few months,
we had the first test run with the system.
