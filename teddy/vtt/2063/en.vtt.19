00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:33.547
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.563
tomatoes in Tenerife,

00:09:35.563 --> 00:09:37.368
oranges in Florida,

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.372
bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.787
all being discarded. This is one day's waste

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:45.324

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.600
If we do that to fruit and vegetables,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.415

00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:57.154
Liver, lungs, heads, tails,

00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:59.132
kidneys, testicles,

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.845
all of these things which are traditional,
