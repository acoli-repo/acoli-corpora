00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.664
and as you can see, most European

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:33.076
and North American countries

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:36.216
fall between 150 and 200 percent

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.596
of the nutritional requirements of their populations.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:42.004
So a country like America has twice as much food

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.608
on its shop shelves and in its restaurants

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:48.176
than is actually required to feed the American people.

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:49.736
But the thing that really struck me,

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:53.951
when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.617
was that you can see how it levels off.

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.685
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,
