Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.730
to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.214
we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,

00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:43.770
opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.730
But this is what you can see more or less on

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.242
every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.

00:07:49.242 --> 00:07:52.308
It represents a colossal waste of food,

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:54.810
but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.154
was that this very evident abundance of waste

00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:01.098
was actually the tip of the iceberg.
