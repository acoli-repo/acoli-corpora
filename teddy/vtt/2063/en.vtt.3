00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.795
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:36.145
and the provision of the solution to food waste,

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.799
which is simply to sit down and eat food,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.287
rather than throwing it away.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.566
That became, as it were, a way of confronting

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.553
large businesses in the business of wasting food,

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.074
and exposing, most importantly, to the public,

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.244
that when we're talking about food being thrown away,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.383
we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about

00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:56.095
stuff that's beyond the pale.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.211
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.749
on a colossal scale.
