00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.749
on a colossal scale.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.606
Eventually, I set about writing my book,

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:04.660
really to demonstrate the extent of this problem

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.056
on a global scale. What this shows is

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:11.535
a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:14.637
of food waste in each country in the world.

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.525
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.007
and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.160
some proxy way of uncovering

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.405
how much food was being wasted.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.961
So I took the food supply of every single country

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.003
and I compared it to what was actually likely
