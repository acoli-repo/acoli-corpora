00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.917
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.521
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,

00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:35.286
and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.852
and he started frowning into my bowl.

00:10:37.852 --> 00:10:39.731
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?

00:10:39.731 --> 00:10:41.325
How have I insulted my host?"

00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:43.063
He pointed at three grains of rice

00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:47.347
at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.259
I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.675
telling people to stop wasting food.

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:55.724
This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)

00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:58.947
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,

00:10:58.947 --> 00:11:03.983
do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources
