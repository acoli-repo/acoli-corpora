00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.608
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:01.982
about how much food they were wasting.

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.466
I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.217
being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.238
and I thought, surely there is something more sensible

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:13.405
to do with food than waste it.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.710
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.397
I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.472
that used to crop up from time to time.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:22.874
I grabbed hold of it,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.420
sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.540
That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.795
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,
