00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.845
all of these things which are traditional,

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:03.660
delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.156
go to waste. Offal consumption has halved

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:09.691
in Britain and America in the last 30 years.

00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.331
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,

00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.100
or is incinerated.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.947
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,

00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:19.862
is serving up his national dish.

00:10:19.862 --> 00:10:21.577
It's called sheep's organs.

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.244
It's delicious, it's nutritious,

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:25.652
and as I learned when I went to Kashgar,

00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:28.721
it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.

00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.917
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.
