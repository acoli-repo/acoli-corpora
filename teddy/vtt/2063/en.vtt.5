00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.003
and I compared it to what was actually likely

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.035
to be being consumed in each country.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:36.922
That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:39.588
levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:40.930
that gives you an approximate guess

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.157
as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.886
That black line in the middle of that table

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:49.882
is the likely level of consumption

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:54.244
with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.163
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.143
that I think we can live in a waste-free world.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:02.016
But that black line shows what a food supply should be
