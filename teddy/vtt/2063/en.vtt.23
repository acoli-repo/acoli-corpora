00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:32.987
Most people. The one on the left

00:11:32.987 --> 00:11:34.440
was kept in a fridge for 10 days.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.659
The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:39.234
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.

00:11:39.234 --> 00:11:41.416
It's a living organism, cut the slice off,

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.859
stuck it in a vase of water,

00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:46.407
it was all right for another two weeks after this.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:48.366
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning,

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:50.198
will inevitably arise, so the question is,

00:11:50.198 --> 00:11:52.396
what is the best thing to do with it?

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:53.902
I answered that question when I was 15.

00:11:53.902 --> 00:11:59.312
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:01.524
We domesticated pigs
