00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.856
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.513
into delicious pork. I sold that pork

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.500
to my school friends' parents, and I made

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.137
a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:44.019
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.402
was in fact fit for human consumption,

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.671
and that I was only scratching the surface,

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.533
and that right the way up the food supply chain,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.751
in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.011
in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.608
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me
