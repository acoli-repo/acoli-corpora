00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:01.524
We domesticated pigs

00:12:01.524 --> 00:12:04.296
to turn food waste back into food.

00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:08.027
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:11.314
since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.215
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.898
If you cook food for pigs, just as if

00:12:15.898 --> 00:12:18.867
you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.

00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:21.427
It's also a massive saving of resources.

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:24.322
At the moment, Europe depends on importing

00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:25.988
millions of tons of soy from South America,

00:12:25.988 --> 00:12:28.874
where its production contributes to global warming,

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:31.474
to deforestation, to biodiversity loss,
