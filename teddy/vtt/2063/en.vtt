The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal

00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:06.735
started for me when I was 15 years old.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.256
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:11.639
And I started to feed them in the most traditional

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.610
and environmentally friendly way.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.935
I went to my school kitchen, and I said,

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:17.481
"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:18.347
their noses up at."

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.011
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:23.743
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:25.581
who was throwing away potatoes because they were

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.767
the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.856
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste
