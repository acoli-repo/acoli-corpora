The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:34.169
to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.013
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:43.188
and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:45.806
so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.040
in meat and dairy products.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.624
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:53.177
This is what most of us think of when we think

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:55.688
of food waste, what ends up in the garbage,

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:57.536
what ends up in supermarket bins,

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.266
what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,
