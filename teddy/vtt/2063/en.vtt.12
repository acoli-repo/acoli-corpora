00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.705
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:04.233
that I found in the bin represent the global food supply,

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.834
okay? We start out with nine.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.317
That's what's in fields around the world every single year.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.078
The first biscuit we're going to lose

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.837
before we even leave the farm.

00:06:12.837 --> 00:06:16.102
That's a problem primarily associated with

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:17.766
developing work agriculture, whether it's

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:20.271
a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,

00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.184
grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:26.933
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.429
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide
