00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:01.098
was actually the tip of the iceberg.

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:03.154
When you start going up the supply chain,

00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:06.140
you find where the real food waste is happening

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.127
on a gargantuan scale.

00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:09.600
Can I have a show of hands

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.058
if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?

00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:15.977
Who lives in a household where that crust --

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:19.170
that slice at the first and last end of each loaf --

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.614
who lives in a household where it does get eaten?

00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:23.981
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people,

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.437
and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,

00:08:26.437 --> 00:08:29.226
and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:31.462
anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches
