00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.955
have between three and four times the amount of food

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.039
that their population needs to feed itself.

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.322
A country like America has four times the amount of food

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:41.284
that it needs.

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:44.246
When people talk about the need to increase global

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.906
food production to feed those nine billion people

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:49.418
that are expected on the planet by 2050,

00:04:49.418 --> 00:04:51.139
I always think of these graphs.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.090
The fact is, we have an enormous buffer

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.971
in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.

00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:02.647
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
