00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.685
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:03.973
and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.519
as you might expect.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.064
So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.349
to see if that was true or false.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.843
And that's what I came up with.

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:13.770
If you include not just the food that ends up

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.894
in shops and restaurants, but also the food

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:18.050
that people feed to livestock,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.553
the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.034
but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:25.965
increasing amounts of meat and dairy products,

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.632
what you find is that most rich countries

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.955
have between three and four times the amount of food
