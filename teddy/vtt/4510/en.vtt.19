00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.763
and the mushroom
with its very fine filaments.

00:09:31.763 --> 00:09:34.197
Looking closer,
we can see that this mushroom

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.263
is very gentle in its penetration.

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:39.963
It will proliferate
between the root's cells,

00:09:39.963 --> 00:09:43.030
eventually penetrating a cell

00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:48.130
and starting to form
a typical arbuscular structure,

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:53.330
which will considerably increase
the exchange interface

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.897
between the plant and the mushroom.

00:09:55.897 --> 00:09:59.330
And it is through this structure
that mutual exchanges will occur.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.963
It’s a win-win trade:
