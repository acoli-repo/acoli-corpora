Some are happier than others.

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:36.630
And now, looking at this picture,
which speaks for itself,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.763
we see modern agriculture,

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:42.297
which I also refer to
as intensive agriculture.

00:03:42.297 --> 00:03:46.763
Intensive agriculture is based
on the use of chemical fertilizers.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:49.797
Without them,
we would not manage to produce enough

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:52.830
to feed the world's population.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.297
Speaking of humans, there are currently
7 billion of us on Earth.

00:03:56.597 --> 00:03:59.730
In less than 40 years,
there will be 9 billion of us.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.097
And the question is a simple one:
Do we have enough phosphorus
