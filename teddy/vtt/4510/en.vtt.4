00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.730
Because it is
the most problematic chemical element.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.397
By the end of my presentation,
you will have seen

00:02:04.563 --> 00:02:07.730
what these problems are,
and where we are today.

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:11.630
Phosphorus is a chemical element

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.030
that is essential to life.
This is a very important point.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.663
I’d like everyone to understand precisely
what the phosphorus issue is.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:22.830
Phosphorus is a key component
in several molecules,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.497
in many of our molecules of life.

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:27.497
Experts in the field will know

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:30.463
that cellular communication
is phosphorus-based --
