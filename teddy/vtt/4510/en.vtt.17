This slide illustrates the elements
of a mycorrhiza.

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:37.263
You’re looking at the root of wheat,

00:08:37.263 --> 00:08:40.597
one of the world’s most important plants.

00:08:41.363 --> 00:08:44.197
Normally, a root will find phosphorus
all by itself.

00:08:44.197 --> 00:08:46.230
It will go in search of phosphorus,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.463
but only within the one millimeter
which surrounds it.

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:52.930
Beyond one millimeter,
the root is ineffective.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.297
It cannot go further
in its search for phosphorus.

00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:58.030
Now, imagine this tiny,
microscopic mushroom.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.297
It grows much faster,
