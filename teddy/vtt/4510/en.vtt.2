00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.897
We use fertilizers in our farming,
chemical fertilizers.

00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:10.963
Why do we use chemical fertilizers
in agriculture?

00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:15.297
Basically, to help plants grow
and to produce a better yield.

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.630
The issue is that this is set to engender

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.930
an environmental problem
that is without precedent.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.897
Before going further, let me give you
a crash course in plant biology.

00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:29.363
So, what does a plant need
in order to grow?

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:33.897
A plant, quite simply,
needs light, it needs CO2,
