I'm going to start
by asking you a question:

00:00:03.563 --> 00:00:07.630
Is anyone familiar
with the blue algae problem?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.663
Okay, so most of you are.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:12.730
I think we can all agree
it's a serious issue.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.797
Nobody wants to drink
blue algae-contaminated water,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.630
or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:22.563
Right?

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:24.630
I hope you won't be disappointed,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.830
but today,
I won't be talking about blue algae.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.663
Instead,
I'll be talking about the main cause
