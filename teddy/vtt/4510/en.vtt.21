00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.963
That's completely natural.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.297
What's more is that in certain cases,
we don't even need to add phosphorus.

00:10:37.297 --> 00:10:39.730
If you recall the graphs
I showed you earlier,

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.930
85% of phosphorus is lost in the soil,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.197
and the plants are unable to access it.

00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:49.997
Even though it is present in the soil,
it is in insoluble form.

00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:52.997
The plant is only able to seek out
soluble forms.

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:56.797
The mushroom is capable
of dissolving this insoluble form

00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.263
and making it available
for the plant to use.
