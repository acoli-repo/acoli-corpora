00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.663
Instead,
I'll be talking about the main cause

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:34.630
at the root of this issue,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.030
which I will be referring to
as the phosphorus crisis.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.930
Why have I chosen to talk to you
about the phosphorus crisis today?

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.197
For the simple reason
that nobody else is talking about it.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:49.463
And by the end of my presentation,
I hope that the general public

00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:54.030
will be more aware of this crisis
and this issue.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.397
Now, the problem is that if I ask,

00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:00.430
why do we find ourselves
in this situation with blue algae?
