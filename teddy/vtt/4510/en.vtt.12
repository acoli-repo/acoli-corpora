00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.263
So that really puts it into perspective.

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:02.463
So, we get phosphorus from mines.

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.897
And if I make a comparison with oil,

00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:09.030
there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it,
we talk about global warming,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.063
yet we never mention
the phosphorus crisis.

00:06:11.063 --> 00:06:14.897
To come back to the oil problem,
oil is something we can replace.

00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:19.630
We can use biofuels, or solar power,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.397
or hydropower,
but phosphorus is an essential element,

00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:27.097
indispensable to life,
and we can’t replace it.

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:32.630
What is the current state
of the world's phosphorus reserves?
