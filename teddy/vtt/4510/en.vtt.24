00:11:58.763 --> 00:12:05.763
And here, where blue
indicates a better yield,

00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:08.597
and yellow a weaker yield.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.430
The black rectangle is the plot

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.830
from which the mycorrhiza was added.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.197
In other words, as I already said,
I have invented nothing.

00:12:17.197 --> 00:12:19.930
Mycorrhiza has existed
for 450 million years,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.197
and it has even helped
modern-day plant species to diversify.

00:12:24.197 --> 00:12:28.763
So, this it isn't something
that is still undergoing lab tests.

00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:31.163
Mycorrhiza exists, it works,
