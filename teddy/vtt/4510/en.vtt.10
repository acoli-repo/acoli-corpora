00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:01.163
Eighty percent of each dose
of phosphorus is lost.

00:05:02.897 --> 00:05:08.563
Modern agriculture
depends on phosphorus.

00:05:08.563 --> 00:05:13.163
And because in order to get 15% of it
to the plant, all the rest is lost,

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:15.063
we have to add more and more.

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:18.463
Now, where will we get
this phosphorus from?

00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:22.330
Basically, we get it out of mines.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.097
This is the cover
of an extraordinary article

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:27.130
published in Nature in 2009,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.330
which really launched the discussion
about the phosphorus crisis.
