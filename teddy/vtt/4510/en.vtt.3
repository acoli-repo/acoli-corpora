00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:33.897
A plant, quite simply,
needs light, it needs CO2,

00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:37.530
but even more importantly,
it needs nutrients,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.563
which it draws from the soil.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.763
Several of these nutrients
are essential chemical elements:

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:47.797
phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:52.530
So, the plant’s roots will extract
these resources.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.397
Today I'll be focusing on a major problem
that is linked to phosphorus.

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:58.063
Why phosphorus in particular?

00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.730
Because it is
the most problematic chemical element.
