00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:30.463
that cellular communication
is phosphorus-based --

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:32.663
phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.

00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:37.963
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based:
These are called phospholipids.

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:43.430
The energy in all living things,
ATP, is phosphorus-based.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.497
And more importantly still,
phosphorus is a key component of DNA,

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:54.897
something everyone is familiar with,
and which is shown in this image.

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:58.197
DNA is our genetic heritage.

00:02:58.197 --> 00:03:02.530
It is extremely important, and once again,
phosphorus is a key player.
