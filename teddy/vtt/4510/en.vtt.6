It is extremely important, and once again,
phosphorus is a key player.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.663
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:10.730
As humans, where do we find it?

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.197
As I explained earlier,

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:16.697
plants extract phosphorus
from the soil, through water.

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.697
So, we humans get it
from the things we eat:

00:03:20.563 --> 00:03:22.963
plants, vegetables, fruits,

00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:26.263
and also from eggs, meat and milk.

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:29.830
It’s true that some humans
eat better than others.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.797
Some are happier than others.
