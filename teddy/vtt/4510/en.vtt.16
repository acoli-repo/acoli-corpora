00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:01.730
and it's a microscopic mushroom
that is very mysterious,

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.263
very simple,
and yet also extremely complex.

00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:10.463
I've been fascinated by this little
mushroom for over 16 years now.

00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:14.330
It has led me to further my research

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.697
and to use it as a model
for my laboratory research.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.130
This mushroom exists in symbiosis
with the roots.

00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:26.797
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional
and mutually beneficial association

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:29.830
which is also called mycorrhiza.
