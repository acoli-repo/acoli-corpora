00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.530
It goes into the soil,
ending its journey in the lakes,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.530
resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,
which leads to the blue algae problem.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.263
So, you’ll see there’s a problem here,
something that is illogical.

00:04:41.263 --> 00:04:45.363
100% of the phosphorus is used,
but only 15% goes to the plant.

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:47.630
You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.263
Yes, it is. What is worse
is that it is very expensive.

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:55.630
Nobody wants to throw their money
out the window,

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.963
but unfortunately
that's what is happening here.

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:01.163
Eighty percent of each dose
of phosphorus is lost.
