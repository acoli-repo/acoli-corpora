00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.263
and making it available
for the plant to use.

00:11:00.263 --> 00:11:03.797
To further support my argument,
here is a picture that speaks for itself.

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:07.697
These are trials
in a field of sorghum.

00:11:07.697 --> 00:11:12.197
On the left side, you see the yield
produced using conventional agriculture,

00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:14.797
with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.163
On the other side,
the dose was reduced to 50 percent,

00:11:18.163 --> 00:11:19.697
and just look at the yield.

00:11:19.697 --> 00:11:25.263
With only a half-dose,
we achieved a better yield.

00:11:25.263 --> 00:11:30.097
This is to show you
that this method works.
