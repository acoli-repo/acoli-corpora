00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.097
And the question is a simple one:
Do we have enough phosphorus

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:05.963
to feed our future generations?

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:11.063
So, in order to understand these issues,
where do we find our phosphorus?

00:04:11.063 --> 00:04:12.697
Let me explain.

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:15.430
But first, let’s just suppose

00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:20.597
that we are using
100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.697
Only 15% of this 100% goes to the plant.

00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:28.663
Eighty-five percent is lost.
