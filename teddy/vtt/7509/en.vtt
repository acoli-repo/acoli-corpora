I often get this question:

00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:05.334
"Why would anyone buy
a piece of clothing that doesn't exist?"

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.255
And as you can see,
it's not that it doesn't exist.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.342
Digital fashion is real, and it exists
in so many virtual universes,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.219
ranging from basic social networks

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:18.514
to fully developed virtual worlds
known as the metaverse,

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:22.060
letting people express themselves
in a way not possible before.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.271
Iâ€™ve been playing video games
since I [can] remember,

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:27.356
dressing up my game character.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:30.318
Actually, I enjoyed it more
than dressing up myself.
