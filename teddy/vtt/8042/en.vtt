00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:10.673
Nestled in the remote forests 
of northern Canada

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:13.634
sits the worldâ€™s longest beaver dam.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.387
Curving around the water 
like a castle wall,

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:22.560
this 850-meter-long structure is large 
enough to be seen in satellite imagery.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.773
The dam and the generations 
of North American beavers that maintain it

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:29.358
have dramatically transformed the region,

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:33.613
creating a pond containing roughly 
70,000,000 liters of water.
