00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:10.413
On a small island in the middle
of the Irish Sea,

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:13.329
fortresses preside over the rugged shores.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.163
This unlikely location
was the birthplace of a medieval empire

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:23.204
that lasted 200 years,
ruled by a dynasty of sea kings.

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.788
The first of these kings
was Godred Crovan,

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:31.288
a notorious warlord descended 
from Irish and Viking rulers.
