00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.779
It's a pleasure to be here

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.728
in Edinburgh, Scotland,

00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:06.891
the birthplace of the needle and syringe.

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:09.732
Less than a mile from here in this direction,

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:11.706
in 1853 a Scotsman

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:14.134
filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:16.236
His name was Alexander Wood,

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:19.987
and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.465
This is the patent.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:25.176
What blows my mind when I look at it even today

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.349
is that it looks almost identical

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.106
to the needle in use today.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:32.666
Yet, it's 160 years old.
