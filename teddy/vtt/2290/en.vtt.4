00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:02.605
for our children and grandchildren
to have, one day,

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.913
a place they can call home, with pride.

00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:11.201
And you can ask yourself

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:16.508
where this shift of mindset
has brought our country.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.255
Today in Rwanda,

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:26.906
we have the highest percentage
of women in parliament.

00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:30.061
