00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.309
I came back to my home of Rwanda

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:09.428
two years after the 1994 genocide
against the Tutsi.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.666
The country was devastated.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:16.596
The children I was caring for
in the hospitals

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.640
were dying from treatable conditions,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:25.745
because we didn't have equipment
or medicine to save them.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:32.125
I was tempted to pack my bag and run away.
