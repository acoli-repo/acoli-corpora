00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:00.781
(Laughter)

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:05.810
We have reduced
child mortality by 75 percent,

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.230
maternal mortality by 80 percent.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.516
In early 2000s,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.505
there were nine women
who were dying every day

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.646
around delivery and pregnancy.

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.767
Today, it's around two.

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:23.358
It's an unfinished agenda.

00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:25.596
We still have a long way to go.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.437
Two is still too much.
