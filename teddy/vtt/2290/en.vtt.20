This is a statement against
the current inequity

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:06.078
for women to access
medical education in our continent.

00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:13.047
I believe in women's education.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:18.140
This is why I applaud African ladies
who go all over the world

00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:21.688
to increase their education,
their skills and their knowledge.

00:10:21.712 --> 00:10:25.071
But I hope they will bring
that back to Africa

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:27.331
to build the continent

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:30.172
and make the continent a strong continent,
