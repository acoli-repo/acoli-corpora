00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:33.152
We educate our students

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:39.232
to provide quality,
equitable, holistic care

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:42.303
to everyone, leaving no one out,

00:06:43.034 --> 00:06:47.298
focusing on the vulnerable,
especially women and children,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.827
who are historically
the last to be served.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:55.592
We transform them into leaders

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:59.808
and give them managerial skills
and advocacy skills

00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:03.666
for them to be smooth changemakers
