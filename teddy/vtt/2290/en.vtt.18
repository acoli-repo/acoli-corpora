but turn the education we give
in quality clinical services,

00:09:00.712 --> 00:09:02.579
especially for the vulnerable.

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.998
And doing so,

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:12.323
they sign an agreement at the start
that they will do that,

00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:14.395
a binding agreement.

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:15.966
We don't want money.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.457
We have to go and mobilize the money.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:24.463
But they will turn this
in quality service delivery for all.

00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:29.053
For this, of course,

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:32.553
we need a strong gender equity agenda.
