00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:01.544
I climbed up,

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:05.522
I was at the top level
of the three-tier bunk,

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:09.124
and there was Mr. Levine
with a deck of cards.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:12.833
And he was shuffling these cards.

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.013
And I couldn't understand it, you know,

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:18.149
having a deck of cards in Auschwitz

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.424
was like finding a gorilla
in your bathroom.

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:22.449
(Laughter)

00:04:22.473 --> 00:04:24.410
You know, "What is he doing there?"

00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:27.752
And then Mr. Levine turned to me

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:32.744
and offered me the deck,
and said, "Pick a card."
