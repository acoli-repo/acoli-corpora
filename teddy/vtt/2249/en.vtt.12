00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:00.034
and in the middle of the winter,

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:03.600
and by the time we arrived
at a railroad siding,

00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.910
out of the 60,000 people,

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.306
15,000 had died.

00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:12.696
And the rest of us were loaded
into open railroad cars,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.299
and for four days, shipped all the way
from Poland down to Austria.

00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:22.729
And we found ourselves in a death camp,

00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:26.268
in a concentration camp called Mauthausen,

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:29.096
which again was built like a fortress.

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:35.462
And at that point, the SS abandoned us,
