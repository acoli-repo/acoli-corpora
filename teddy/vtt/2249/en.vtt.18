WEBVTT

00:08:56.236 --> 00:09:00.704
is because a very friendly man

00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:05.966
showed a rather scared kid a card trick

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.685
in a concentration camp.

00:09:09.058 --> 00:09:13.177
This man who showed it to me, Mr. Levine,

00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.708
had been a professional magician.

00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:17.573
He worked in Germany,

00:09:17.597 --> 00:09:22.651
and when he came to Auschwitz,
the SS knew who he was,

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:25.840
so they gave him some cards,

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:27.618
they gave him a piece of string,

00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:29.291
they gave him some dice,

00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:31.188
and he performed for them.
