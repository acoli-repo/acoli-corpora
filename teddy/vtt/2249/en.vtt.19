00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:31.188
and he performed for them.

00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:34.822
And then he also taught some of them.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:36.451
He survived the war,

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:39.490
but his wife and his son died.

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:44.823
He came to the United States
and performed in various venues,

00:09:44.847 --> 00:09:48.109
but I never met him again.

00:09:48.998 --> 00:09:53.180
But the trick that he showed me
stayed with me

00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:56.529
and enabled me to go around schools

00:09:56.553 --> 00:10:01.532
and try to make this world
just a little bit better.
