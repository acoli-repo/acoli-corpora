00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:30.085
I had no education, I had no skills.

00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:33.101
I started working,

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:36.617
and about a year
after I arrived in England,

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.132
I bought myself a deck of cards.

00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:41.791
And for the very first time,

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:46.014
I actually performed the trick

00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:51.906
that was shown to me in Auschwitz
on top of a bunk bed.

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:53.989
And it worked.

00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:55.522
It worked beautifully.

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:57.466
And I showed it to some friends of mine,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.690
and they loved it.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:04.122
And I went to a magic store,
and I bought some magic tricks,
