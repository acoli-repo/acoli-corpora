and offered me the deck,
and said, "Pick a card."

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:34.801
So I picked a card,

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.292
and he performed a card trick for me.

00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:39.285
He performed a miracle.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.252
And I'd never seen a card trick before,

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:47.188
and the man who performed it
was sitting right there.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:52.029
And then Mr. Levine did the unthinkable.

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:56.262
He actually explained the trick to me.

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.667
And the words got burned into my brain.
