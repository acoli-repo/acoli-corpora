00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
although Archie Cochrane is a dude.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm not even telling you the story

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because I think we should be running

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
more carefully controlled randomized trials

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in all aspects of public policy,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
although I think that would also be completely awesome.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm telling you this story

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because Archie Cochrane, all his life,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
fought against a terrible affliction,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and he realized it was debilitating to individuals

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and it was corrosive to societies.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And he had a name for it.
