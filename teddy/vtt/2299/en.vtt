00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's the Second World War.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A German prison camp.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And this man,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Archie Cochrane,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a prisoner of war and a doctor,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he has a problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The problem is that the men under his care

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
are suffering

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from an excruciating and debilitating condition

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that Archie doesn't really understand.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The symptoms

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.
