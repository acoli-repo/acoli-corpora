Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It looks like crude oil.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It tastes ...

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
zesty.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And importantly,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it's a rich source

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of vitamin B12.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
into two equal groups.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He gives half of them vitamin C.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He gives half of them vitamin B12.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He very carefully and meticulously notes his results

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in an exercise book.
