00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but I see the God complex around me all the time

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in my fellow economists.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I see it in our business leaders.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I see it in the politicians we vote for --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,

the world is simply far too complex

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to understand in that way.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well let me give you an example.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Imagine for a moment

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,
