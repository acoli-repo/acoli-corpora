American businesses fail faster than Americans,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that they will make us all their pets --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(Laughter)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
if, of course, they haven't already done so.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I sometimes wonder.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But it's this process of trial and error

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that explains this great divergence,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
this incredible performance of Western economies.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It's come through trial and error.
