00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Until then, until then

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and why we should abandon the God complex.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Because it's so hard

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to admit our own fallibility.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's so uncomfortable.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
There's this one trial he ran

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
many years after World War II.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He wanted to test out

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
the question of, where is it

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that patients should recover

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
from heart attacks?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,
