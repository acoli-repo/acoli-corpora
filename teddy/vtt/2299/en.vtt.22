00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
How did it become the world's greatest economy?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I could give you all kinds of facts and figures

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
about the U.S. economy,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
but I think the most salient one is this:

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
ten percent of American businesses

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
disappear every year.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That is a huge failure rate.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Which leads us to conclude

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
American businesses fail faster than Americans,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.
