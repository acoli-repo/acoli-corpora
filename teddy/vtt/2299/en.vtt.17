00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
This baby was produced through trial and error.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I realize that's an ambiguous statement.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Maybe I should clarify it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This baby is a human body: it evolved.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
What is evolution?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Over millions of years, variation and selection,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
variation and selection --

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
trial and error,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
trial and error.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And it's not just biological systems

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that produce miracles through trial and error.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
You could use it in an industrial context.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So let's say you wanted to make detergent.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Let's say you're Unilever
