00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It turns out to be very important.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now if you ascribe to the God complex,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
what you do is you find yourself a little God.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And he will, or she will,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now Unilever did this and it didn't work --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
too complicated.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Even this problem, too complicated.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --
