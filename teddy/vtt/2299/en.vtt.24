It's come through trial and error.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now I've been sort of banging on about this

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
for the last couple of months,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and people sometimes say to me,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Obviously trial and error is very important.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Obviously experimentation is very important.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So I say, okay, fine.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You think it's obvious?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I will admit it's obvious

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
when schools

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
start teaching children

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
