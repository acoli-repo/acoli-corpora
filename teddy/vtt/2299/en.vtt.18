00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So let's say you wanted to make detergent.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Let's say you're Unilever

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
How do you do it?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You create a spray of detergent.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It falls to the floor.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You sell it at a supermarket.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You make lots of money.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
How do you design that nozzle?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It turns out to be very important.
