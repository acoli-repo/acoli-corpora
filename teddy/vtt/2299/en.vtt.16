00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm not trying to say we can't solve

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
complicated problems in a complicated world.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We clearly can.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But the way we solve them

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is with humility --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to abandon the God complex

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And we have a problem-solving technique that works.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now you show me

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a successful complex system,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I will show you a system

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that has evolved through trial and error.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Here's an example.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
This baby was produced through trial and error.
