00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You know Hans:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the Mick Jagger of TED.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
these amazing animations.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But a typical Hans Rosling graph:

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
think for a moment, not what it shows,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but think instead about what it leaves out.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So it'll show you GDP per capita,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
population, longevity,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that's about it.
