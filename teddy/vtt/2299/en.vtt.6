00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and says to his colleagues,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
"This evidence is incontrovertible.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it's a war crime."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the next morning,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the prisoners begin to recover.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now I'm not telling you this story

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
although Archie Cochrane is a dude.
