And he had a name for it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
He called it the God complex.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So the symptoms of the complex

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
are, no matter how complicated the problem,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
you have an absolutely overwhelming belief

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that you are infallibly right in your solution.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now Archie was a doctor,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so he hung around with doctors a lot.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but I see the God complex around me all the time
