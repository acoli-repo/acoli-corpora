00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And there's this huge hubbub.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Archie lets it die down.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
because when I gave you the table of results,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I swapped the two columns around.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It turns out your hospitals are killing people,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and they should be at home.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Would you like to close down the trial now,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
or should we wait until we have robust results?"

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Tumbleweed

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
rolls through the meeting room.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.
