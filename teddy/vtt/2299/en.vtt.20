00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
trial and error,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
variation and selection.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You take a nozzle

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You create 10 variations on that one.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You try out 10 variations on that one.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You see how this works, right?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And after 45 generations,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you have this incredible nozzle.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It looks a bit like a chess piece --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
functions absolutely brilliantly.
