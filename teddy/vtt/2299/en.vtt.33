00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
many decades later

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
In fact, it turns out it's equivalent

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
You prove one, you prove the other.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But it was always a conjecture.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Taniyama tried and tried and tried

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and he could never prove that it was true.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
His friend, Goro Shimura --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
who worked on the mathematics with him --
