00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
around his table,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and he said, "Well, gentlemen,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
we have some preliminary results.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They're not statistically significant.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But we have something.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It is dangerous for patients

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to recover from heart attacks at home.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They should be in hospital."

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Shut it down at once."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And there's this huge hubbub.
