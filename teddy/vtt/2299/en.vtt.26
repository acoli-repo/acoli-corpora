00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I have no idea how to do it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I have half a dozen ideas.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Then we'll test some other ideas out.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We'll get rid of the ones that don't." --

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
when a politician campaigns on that platform,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and more importantly, when voters like you and me

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
are willing to vote for that kind of politician,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
then I will admit

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
(Applause)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Until then, until then
