00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the societies in which our brains evolved

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
had about 300 products and services.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You could count them in five minutes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This perhaps is why

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we find the God complex so tempting.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
we can post some graphs,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
we get it, we understand how this works."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And we don't.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We never do.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm not trying to say we can't solve

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
complicated problems in a complicated world.
