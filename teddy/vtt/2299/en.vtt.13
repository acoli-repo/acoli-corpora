00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that's still nothing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Five thousand products --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
imagine counting every product category

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
in Cesar Hidalgo's data.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Imagine you had one second

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
per product category.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In about the length of this session,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
you would have counted all 5,000.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Now imagine doing the same thing

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
There are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now imagine trying to count

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
every different specific product and service

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
on sale in a major economy

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
such as Tokyo, London or New York.
