WEBVTT

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
functions absolutely brilliantly.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We have no idea

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
why it works,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
no idea at all.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And the moment you step back from the God complex --

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
let's just try to have a bunch of stuff;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
you can solve your problem.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Now this process of trial and error

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is actually far more common in successful institutions

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
than we care to recognize.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we've heard a lot about how economies function.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
