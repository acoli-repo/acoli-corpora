00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Stop giving them lists of questions

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
every single one of which has an answer.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And there's an authority figure in the corner

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And if you can't find the answers,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you must be lazy or stupid.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
When schools stop doing that all the time,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I will admit that, yes,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
When a politician stands up

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
campaigning for elected office

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and says, "I want to fix our health system.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I want to fix our education system.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I have no idea how to do it.
