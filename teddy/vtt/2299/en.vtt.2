00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He said he heard suspicious laughter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
was one of the first men in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to clear up the mess.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And one more thing:

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Archie was suffering from this illness himself.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So the situation seemed pretty desperate.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But Archie Cochrane

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
was a resourceful person.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and now he managed

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to get hold of supplies of marmite

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
on the black market.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.
