Hi I'm Andrea Gibson and this
is my poem "The Nutritionist."

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.772
The nutritionist said I should
eat root vegetables

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:09.893
Said if I could get down 13 turnips a day

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.125
I would be grounded,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.861
rooted.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.099
Said my head would not keep flying away 
to where the darkness lives.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.587
The psychic told me my heart
carries too much weight

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:19.498
Said for 20 dollars she’d tell me what to do

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:21.053
I handed her the twenty, she said

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.278
“stop worrying darling, you 
will find a good man soon.”

00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:29.138
The first psychotherapist said I should 
spend 3 hours a day sitting in a dark closet

00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:31.587
with my eyes closed 
and my ears plugged.
