00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.057
something touched me.

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:36.606
I could see that the security guard
was moved by the building

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:41.829
and that architecture has that capacity

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:43.015
to move you.

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.956
I could see it, and I remember thinking,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.205
"Wow. How does architecture do that?"

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.531
At school, I was learning to design,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.617
but here -- here was
a reaction of the heart.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.243
And it touched me to the core.
