00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:02.645
But alabaster was too soft,

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.145
and we were experimenting,
many experiments with materials,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.535
trying to think how we could have
this kind of shimmer,

00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:13.616
and we ended up with borosilicate.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.216
And borosilicate glass,
as you know, is very strong,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.466
and if you break borosilicate rods
just so and melt them

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.794
at just the right temperature,

00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:26.586
we ended up with this new material,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.824
this new cast glass which took us
about two years to make.
