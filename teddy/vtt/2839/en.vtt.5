00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:31.896
the very opposite.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.027
It had to be open, welcoming

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.595
to people of all faiths,
walks of life, backgrounds,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.604
or no faith at all;

00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:47.632
a new form of sacred space

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.670
with no pattern

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:53.178
or models to draw from.

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:58.186
It was like designing one of the first
churches for Christianity

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.892
or one of the first mosques for Islam.
