00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:05.155
The school of architecture
that I studied at some 30 years ago

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:09.018
happened to be across the street
from the wonderful art gallery

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.230
designed by the great
architect Louis Kahn.

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:16.870
I love the building,
and I used to visit it quite often.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:18.425
One day,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.544
I saw the security guard run his hand
across the concrete wall.

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:26.764
And it was the way he did it,

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.522
the expression on his face --

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.057
something touched me.
