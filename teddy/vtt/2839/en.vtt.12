00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.866
And so we drew and made models,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.105
these lines that merge at the top,

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.467
soft lines,

00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:11.428
which became like drapery

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:14.949
and translucent veils and folding,

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:19.063
and the idea of not only
folding but torquing --

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.091
you remember the plant
and the way it was reaching.

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:26.556
And this started to become
an interesting form,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.267
carving the base, making the entrances.

00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:32.099
And then we ended up with this.
