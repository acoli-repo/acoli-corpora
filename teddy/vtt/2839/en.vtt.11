and we kept thinking,
well, what is perfection?

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:41.177
And I remember I stumbled into this image
of this Japanese basket

00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:45.202
and thinking our Western notions
of perfection need to be challenged,

00:05:45.226 --> 00:05:49.949
that this wonderful silhouette
of this basket, this wonkiness,

00:05:49.973 --> 00:05:55.621
and that it has the kind of dimple
of what you might imagine a shoulder

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.152
or the cheekbone,

00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:59.309
and that kind of organic form.
