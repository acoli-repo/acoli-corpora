00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:02.129
are probably those
who have not only tried,

00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:04.643
but they have successfully
licked the elbow

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.358
of the person sitting next to them.

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:07.384
(Laughter)

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:09.093
Those are the extroverts.

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:12.536
Let me deal in a bit more detail
with extroversion,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.519
because it's consequential
and it's intriguing,

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:19.024
and it helps us understand
what I call our three natures.

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:22.719
First, our biogenic nature --
our neurophysiology.

00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:25.726
Second, our sociogenic or second nature,

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.137
which has to do with the cultural
and social aspects of our lives.
