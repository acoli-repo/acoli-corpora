00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:30.171
Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
concrete, simple language.

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:35.648
Introverts prefer --
and I must again tell you

00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:40.029
that I am as extreme an introvert
as you could possibly imagine --

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.570
we speak differently.

00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:46.589
We prefer contextually complex,

00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:48.545
contingent,

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.585
weasel-word sentences --

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:51.632
(Laughter)

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.018
More or less.

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:54.821
(Laughter)

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:56.045
As it were.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.084
(Laughter)

00:08:57.108 --> 00:08:59.108
Not to put too fine a point upon it --

00:08:59.848 --> 00:09:01.021
like that.
