00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:31.547
displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today.

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:32.918
(Laughter)

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:35.944
And I thought you might
like to know who you are.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.391
(Laughter)

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.102
But instead of pointing at you,

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.324
which would be gratuitous and intrusive,

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.866
I thought I would tell you
a few facts and stories,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.927
in which you may catch
a glimpse of yourself.

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.325
I'm in the field of research
known as personality psychology,

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:57.789
which is part of a larger
personality science

00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:02.922
which spans the full spectrum,
from neurons to narratives.
