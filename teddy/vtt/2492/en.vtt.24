00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:01.224
You have a personal project right now,

00:12:01.248 --> 00:12:04.334
but nobody may know it here.

00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:07.312
It relates to your kid --

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.536
you've been back three times
to the hospital,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.456
and they still don't know what's wrong.

00:12:13.373 --> 00:12:14.697
Or it could be your mom.

00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:18.194
And you'd been acting out of character.

00:12:18.218 --> 00:12:19.780
These are free traits.

00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.601
You're very agreeable,
but you act disagreeably

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:28.498
in order to break down those barriers
of administrative torpor

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:29.673
in the hospital,

00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:32.323
to get something
for your mom or your child.
