00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:30.230
(Laughter)

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:32.075
(Applause)

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.776
Now, as an introvert,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.981
I might gently allude to certain
"assholic" qualities

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:41.300
in this man's behavior,

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:44.128
but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.

00:10:44.152 --> 00:10:45.928
(Laughter)

00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:48.494
But the extrovert says,

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:51.392
"If he walks like one, if he talks
like one, I call him one."

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.828
And we go past each other.

00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:57.464
Now is this something
that we should be heedful of?

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:58.654
Of course.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.262
It's important that we know this.
