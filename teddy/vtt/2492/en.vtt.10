00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.007
you see the extroverts
forming a magnetic core.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.690
They all gather together.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:04.129
And I've seen you.

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.476
The introverts are more likely
to spend time in the quiet spaces

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.323
up on the second floor,

00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:13.139
where they are able
to reduce stimulation --

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:17.098
and may be misconstrued
as being antisocial,

00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:20.120
but you're not necessarily antisocial.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.208
It may be that you simply realize
that you do better

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:29.847
when you have a chance
to lower that level of stimulation.
