00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:41.097
We communicate differently,
extroverts and introverts.

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:44.082
Extroverts, when they interact,

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:48.571
want to have lots of social encounter
punctuated by closeness.

00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:51.586
They'd like to stand close
for comfortable communication.

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:54.746
They like to have a lot of eye contact,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.114
or mutual gaze.

00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.448
We found in some research

00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:01.470
that they use more diminutive terms
when they meet somebody.
