00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:04.304
What an intriguing
group of individuals you are ...

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.953
to a psychologist.

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:08.416
(Laughter)

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.546
I've had the opportunity
over the last couple of days

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.156
of listening in on some
of your conversations

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.150
and watching you interact with each other.

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:19.699
And I think it's fair to say, already,

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:24.911
that there are 47 people in this audience,

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:26.712
at this moment,

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:31.547
displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today.
