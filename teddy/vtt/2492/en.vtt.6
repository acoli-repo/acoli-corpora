00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.111
And so we know that, for example,

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:06.110
openness and conscientiousness
are very good predictors of life success,

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.206
but the open people achieve that success
through being audacious

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.408
and, occasionally, odd.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:18.442
The conscientious people
achieve it through sticking to deadlines,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:22.388
to persevering, as well as
having some passion.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.548
Extroversion and agreeableness
are both conducive

00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:30.150
to working well with people.
