00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.917
So here's the most important economic fact of our time.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.947
We are living in an age of surging income inequality,

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.872
particularly between those at the very top

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:14.708
and everyone else.

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:18.730
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.928
but it's a global phenomenon.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.251
It's happening in communist China,

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.974
in formerly communist Russia,

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:28.268
it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:31.235
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies
