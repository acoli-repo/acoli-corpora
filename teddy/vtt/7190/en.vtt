Cloe Sasha Brooks: Hello, TED Community.

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:08.897
You are watching a TED interview series

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.363
called How to Deal
with Difficult Feelings.

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:14.697
Iâ€™m your host, Cloe Shasha Brooks,
and a curator at TED.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:18.330
In this four-episode series,
we've been talking with psychologists,

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:19.897
authors and other experts

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.897
who have shared insights and research
about difficult feelings

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.263
and how we can handle them.

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:26.663
So now I will be speaking
with David Kessler,

00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:30.130
an author who has written six books
on grief and loss.
