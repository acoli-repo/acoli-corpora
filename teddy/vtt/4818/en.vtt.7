00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.787
and draw the diagonals.

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.617
See how many unique loops you can find,

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.107
and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same,

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:40.137
they just start at different points.

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.398
These two, however, are different.

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:47.098
We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.448
You'll find four possible triangles


00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.017
depending on which instrument 
you leave out,

00:03:52.017 --> 00:03:54.948
and two distinct paths on each.

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:58.329
So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes,

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.798
there are 14 that lead to faliure,
