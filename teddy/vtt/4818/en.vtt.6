00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:02.277
that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less.

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:03.925
How do we calculate those odds?

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.727
For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case,

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:13.486
four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:16.327
Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure,

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:19.677
the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:21.725
before they find their instrument.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.316
There are six distinct four-box loops.

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.457
One fun way to count them 
is to make a square,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.626
put an instrument at each corner,

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.787
and draw the diagonals.
