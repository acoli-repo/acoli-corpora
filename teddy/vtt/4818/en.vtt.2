00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:02.145
If each one of you 
can find your own instrument,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.005
then you can play tonight.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.004
Otherwise, the label is dropping you.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.794
You have three minutes to think about it
before we start.

00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:12.334
The band is in despair.

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.854
After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.334
by picking five random boxes.

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:22.650
And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower -

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.774
just 1 in 1024.

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.464
But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:33.044
that has a better than 35% chance
of working.
