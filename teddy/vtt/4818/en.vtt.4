00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:00.435
and then open the box 
with that picture on it.

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:03.505
Keep going that way until you find
your instrument.

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:05.155
The bandmates are skeptical,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.225
but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:12.096
And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.655
So why did the drummer's strategy work?

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.285
Each musician follows a linked sequence

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.945
that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:25.005
and ends with the box 
actually containing it.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.505
Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start,

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:30.106
so this is a loop.
