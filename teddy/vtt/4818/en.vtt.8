00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.798
there are 14 that lead to faliure,

00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.398
and ten that result in success.

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:08.468
That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians,

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:09.848
but if you want a shortcut,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.808
it generalizes to a handy equation.

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:18.107
Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%.

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:20.428
What if there were 1,000 musicians?

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:21.798
1,000,000?

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:26.198
As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:32.228
Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless.
