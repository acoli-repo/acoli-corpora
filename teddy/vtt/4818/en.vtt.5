00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:30.106
so this is a loop.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:32.925
For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so,

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:36.034
the singer would open the first box
to find the drums,

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:38.265
go to the eighth box to find the bass,

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.065
and find her microphone in the third box,

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:43.886
which would point back to the first.

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:46.475
This works much better 
than random guessing

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:49.824
because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument,

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:54.435
each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument,

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.836
and there are decent odds, about 35%,


00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:02.277
that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less.
