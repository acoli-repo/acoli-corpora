00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.353
Your favorite band is great
at playing music,

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:13.474
but not so great at being organized.

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:16.264
They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour,

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.764
and it's driving their manager mad.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:20.574
On the day of the big concert,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.884
the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:26.564
in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.804
Their manager explains what's happening.

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:32.034
Outside, there are ten large boxes.
