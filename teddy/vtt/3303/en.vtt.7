Let me give you an example.

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:36.559
Matching people's TV preferences

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:40.851
reveals that Americans who rank
immigration among their top three concerns

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.667
are more likely to be fans
of "The Walking Dead,"

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.768
and they often watch

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.083
which is measurable.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.726
A person's biological signature

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.601

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:02.893
Then our predictive model
finds patterns between media imprints
