To answer this, I had to build a machine.

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:02.268
(Laughter)

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:05.184
I've been developing
an open-source biometric lab,

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.684
an AI system which I call the Limbic Lab.

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:10.143
The lab not only captures

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:14.393
the brain and body's unconscious response
to media and technology

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:17.393
but also uses machine learning
to adapt content

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:19.625
based on these biological responses.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.184
My goal is to find out what combination
of narrative ingredients

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:26.351
are the most appealing and galvanizing

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.184
to specific target audiences

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:33.226
to enable social justice, cultural
and educational organizations
