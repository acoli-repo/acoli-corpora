00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:32.684
Imagine if nonprofits and media makers
were able to measure how audiences feel

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:34.559
as they experience it

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.976
and alter content on the fly.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.458
I believe this is the future of media.

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.934
To date, most media
and social-change strategies

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.809
have attempted to appeal
to mass audiences,

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:50.333
but the future is media
customized for each person.

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:54.143
As real-time measurement
of media consumption

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.018
and automated media production
becomes the norm,

00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:01.101
we will soon be consuming media
tailored directly to our cravings
