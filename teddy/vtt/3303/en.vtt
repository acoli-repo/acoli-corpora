For the past 15 years I've been trying
to change your mind.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.768
In my work I harness pop culture
and emerging technology

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.250
to shift cultural norms.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.518
I've made video games
to promote human rights,

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:20.601
I've made animations to raise awareness
about unfair immigration laws

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.851
and I've even made location-based
augmented reality apps

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.518
to change perceptions around homelessness

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.476
well before PokÃ©mon Go.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.851
