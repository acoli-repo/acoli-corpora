00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:01.101
we will soon be consuming media
tailored directly to our cravings

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:05.333
using a blend of psychographics,
biometrics and AI.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.809
It's like personalized medicine
based on our DNA.

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.000
I call it "biomedia."

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:16.309
I am currently testing
the Limbic Lab in a pilot study

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.351
with the Norman Lear Center,

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:22.101
which looks at the top 50
episodic television shows.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.143
But I am grappling
with an ethical dilemma.

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:29.018
If I design a tool
that can be turned into a weapon,

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:30.333
should I build it?
