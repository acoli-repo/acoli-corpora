00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:00.851
As creative technologists,

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.101
we have a responsibility

00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:07.893
not only to reflect upon how present
technology shapes our cultural values

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:09.934
and social behavior,

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:14.893
but also to actively challenge
the trajectory of future technology.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:18.976
It is my hope that we make
an ethical commitment

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.351
to harvesting the body's intelligence

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.809
for the creation of authentic
and just stories

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.226
that transform media and technology

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.726
from harmful weapons
into narrative medicine.
