00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.809
Data is captured at key places
where critical plot points,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.250
character interaction
or unusual camera angles occur.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.018
Like the final scene
in "Game of Thrones, Red Wedding,"

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:13.351
when shockingly,

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:14.934
everybody dies.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.208
(Laughter)

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:20.226
Survey data on that
person's political beliefs,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.393
along with their psychographic
and demographic data,

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.184
are integrated into the system

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:27.917
to gain a deeper understanding
of the individual.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.375
Let me give you an example.
