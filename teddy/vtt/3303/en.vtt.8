Then our predictive model
finds patterns between media imprints

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:04.893
and tells me which narrative ingredients

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.684
are more likely to lead
to engagement in altruistic behavior

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:11.393
rather than distress and apathy.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.601
The more imprints added to the database

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.851
across mediums from episodic
television to games,

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.042
the better the predictive models become.

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:24.268
In short, I am mapping
the first media genome.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:28.083
