to enable social justice, cultural
and educational organizations

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.893
to create more effective media.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:38.768
The Limbic Lab consists of two components:

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.333
a narrative engine and a media machine.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:46.601
While a subject is viewing
or interacting with media content,

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:50.809
the narrative engine takes in and syncs
real-time data from brain waves,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:54.393
biophysical data like heart rate,
blood flow, body temperature

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:56.101
and muscle contraction,

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.083
as well as eye-tracking
and facial expressions.
