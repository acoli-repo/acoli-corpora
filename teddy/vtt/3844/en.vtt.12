00:05:55.907 --> 00:06:00.220
you've created a studio, a place
where young people can go

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.176
and harness the power of digital media

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:04.687
to do some of this action.

00:06:04.687 --> 00:06:06.564
What's happening now with PAWA?

00:06:06.564 --> 00:06:09.347
Boniface Mwangi: So we have 
this community of filmmakers,

00:06:09.347 --> 00:06:12.710
graffiti artists, musicians,
and when there's an issue in the country,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.511
we come together, we brainstorm,
and take up on that issue.

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:17.567
So our most powerful tool is art,

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:21.398
because we live in a very busy world
where people are so busy in their life,

00:06:21.398 --> 00:06:23.465
and they don't have time to read.

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:27.598
So we package our activism
and we package our message in art.

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:32.577
So from the music, the graffiti, 
the art, that's what we do.
