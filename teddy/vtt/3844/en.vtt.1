00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.272
In Sunday school, they taught me
don't confront, don't argue,

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:35.585
even if you're right,
turn the other cheek.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:40.182
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the time.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:43.783
(Laughter)

00:00:43.783 --> 00:00:45.592
Kenya is a country
where you are guilty

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:48.239
until proven rich.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.984
(Laughter)

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.726
Kenya's poor are five times more likely

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:56.650
to be shot dead by the police
who are meant to protect them

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.298
than by criminals.

00:00:58.298 --> 00:01:00.945
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the day.
