00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:31.870
I spent that night in
a cold cement floor in the jail,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.518
and that got me thinking.

00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:36.389
What was making me feel this way?

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.554
My friends and family thought
I was crazy because of what I did,

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:44.568
and the images that I took
were disturbing my life.

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.518
The images that I took
were just a number to many Kenyans.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.465
Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:51.160
It was a story to them.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.947
And so I decided to actually
start a street exhibition

00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:56.733
to show the images of the violence
across the country

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:58.707
and get people talking about it.

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:01.516
We traveled the country
and showed the images,
