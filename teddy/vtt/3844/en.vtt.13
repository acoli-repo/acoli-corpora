00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:32.577
So from the music, the graffiti, 
the art, that's what we do.

00:06:33.557 --> 00:06:35.585
Can I say one more thing?

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:37.466
TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)

00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:40.101
BM: In spite of being arrested,
beaten up, threatened,

00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.814
the moment I discovered my voice,

00:06:41.814 --> 00:06:44.710
that I could actually stand up
for what I really believed in,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.748
I'm no longer afraid.

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:48.490
I used to be called softy,
but I'm no longer softy,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.891
because I discovered who I really am,
as in, that's what I want to do,

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.927
and there's such beauty in doing that.

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:58.316
There's nothing as powerful as that,
knowing that I'm meant to do this,

00:06:58.316 --> 00:07:01.463
because you don't get scared,
you just continue living your life.
