00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.595
signed a peace agreement,
and the country moved on.

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:04.124
I was a very disturbed man
because I saw the violence firsthand.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.730
I saw the killings.
I saw the displacement.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.811
I met women who had been raped,
and it disturbed me,

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.855
but the country never spoke about it.

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.339
We pretended. We all became smart cowards.

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.938
We decided to stay out of trouble
and not talk about it.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:22.235
Ten months later, I quit my job.
I said I could not stand it anymore.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.830
After quitting my job,
I decided to organize my friends

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.850
to speak about
the violence in the country,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.714
to speak about the state of the nation,

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:32.830
and June 1, 2009 was the day
that we were meant to go to the stadium
