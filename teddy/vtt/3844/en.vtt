00:00:01.707 --> 00:00:04.596
People back home call me a heckler,

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:07.313
a troublemaker, an irritant,

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:09.983
a rebel, an activist,

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:11.840
the voice of the people.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.010
But that wasn't always me.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.182
Growing up, I had a nickname.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.502
They used to call me Softy,

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:21.755
meaning the soft, harmless boy.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.495
Like every other human being,
I avoided trouble.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.538
In my childhood, they taught me silence.

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:28.340
Don't argue, do as you're told.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.272
In Sunday school, they taught me
don't confront, don't argue,
