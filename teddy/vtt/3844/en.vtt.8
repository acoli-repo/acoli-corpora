00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:01.516
We traveled the country
and showed the images,

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:04.999
and this was a journey that has started me
to the activist path,

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.716
where I decided to become silent no more,

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:09.914
to talk about those things.

00:04:09.914 --> 00:04:13.564
We traveled, and our general site
from our street exhibit

00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:18.362
became for political graffiti
about the situation in the country,

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.120
talking about corruption, bad leadership.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.900
We have even done symbolic burials.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.882
We have delivered live pigs
to Kenya's parliament

00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:30.810
as a symbol of our politicians' greed.
