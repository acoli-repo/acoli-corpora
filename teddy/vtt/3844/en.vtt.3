00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260
I used to question this advice,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.082
and eight years ago
we had an election in Kenya,

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:35.565
and the results were violently disputed.

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:40.302
What followed that election
was terrible violence, rape,

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:44.239
and the killing of over 1,000 people.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.360
My work was to document the violence.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.216
As a photographer,
I took thousands of images,

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:52.283
and after two months,

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:57.158
the two politicians came together,
had a cup of tea,

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.595
signed a peace agreement,
and the country moved on.
