as a symbol of our politicians' greed.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.041
It has been done in Uganda
and other countries,

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.550
and what is most powerful is that
the images have been picked by the media

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.586
and amplified across the country,
across the continent.

00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:42.233
Where I used to stand up alone
seven years ago,

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:45.259
now I belong to a community
of many people who stand up with me.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.587
I am no longer alone when I stand up
to speak about these things.

00:04:50.177 --> 00:04:54.350
I belong to a group of young people
who are passionate about the country,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.200
who want to bring about change,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.614
and they're no longer afraid,
and they're no longer smart cowards.
