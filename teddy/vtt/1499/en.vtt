00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:02.698
When people think about cities,

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:05.000
they tend to think of certain things.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.060
They think of buildings and streets

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.956
and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:11.890
But when I think about cities,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.691
I think about people.

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.161
Cities are fundamentally about people,

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.005
and where people go

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.520
and where people meet

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.850
are at the core of what makes a city work.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.030
So even more important than buildings in a city

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.038
are the public spaces in between them.
