00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:32.427
The result of this
is that you can actually see people

00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:33.796
from your balcony.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.953
The balconies are misregistered.

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:38.121
You can lean over your balcony
and say, "Hey!"

00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:40.346
just like you would across the backyard.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:43.026
To make the balconies more comfortable

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.327
for a longer period of time
during the year,

00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:47.817
we studied the wind
with digital simulations,

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:50.703
so the effect of the balcony shapes
breaks up the wind

00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:52.038
and confuses the wind

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:55.119
and makes the balconies
more comfortable and less windy.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.059
Now, just by being able
to go outside on your balcony

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:01.158
or on the third floor roof terrace,
