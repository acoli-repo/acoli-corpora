00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.406
We asked ourselves simply:

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.386
Can design help rebuild trust?

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:07.430
So we reached out to community members
and police officers in North Lawndale;

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.013
it's a neighborhood in Chicago

00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:11.853
where the police station
is perceived as a scary fortress

00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:13.566
surrounded by a parking lot.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:16.872
In North Lawndale,
people are afraid of police

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.101
and of going anywhere
near the police station,

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.412
even to report a crime.

00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:23.596
So we organized this brainstorming session

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.278
with both groups participating,

00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:28.482
and we came up with this whole
new idea for the police station.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.046
It's called "Polis Station."
