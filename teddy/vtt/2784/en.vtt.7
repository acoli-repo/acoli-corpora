It's super low-tech and easy to do
and anyone can do it --

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.786
and that's the entire point.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.777
The act of making is a social activity.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.420
And it's good for the planet, too:

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:41.540
the trees absorbed carbon
when they were growing up,

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.208
and they gave off oxygen,

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:45.973
and now that carbon
is trapped inside the walls

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:49.170
and it's not being released
into the atmosphere.

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:53.265
So making the walls is equivalent
to taking cars right off the road.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.418
We chose the building method

00:03:56.442 --> 00:04:00.388
because it connects people
to each other and to the environment.
