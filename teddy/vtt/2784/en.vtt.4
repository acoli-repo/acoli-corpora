00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:01.018
And everybody wanted the work
of social justice to be visible

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:02.461
to the outside world.

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:06.309
There really wasn't a precedent
for this kind of space,

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.800
so we looked around the globe
and found examples

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.569
of community meeting houses.

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:13.164
Community meeting houses are places

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:16.549
where there's very specific
relationships between people,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.745
like this one in Mali,
where the elders gather.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.741
The low roof keeps everybody seated
and at equal eye level.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:24.988
It's very egalitarian.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.490
I mean, you can't stand up
and take over the meeting.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.027
You'd actually bump your head.

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:30.704
