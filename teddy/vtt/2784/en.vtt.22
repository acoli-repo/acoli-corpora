00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:02.203
we don't really learn how to engage
the public in the act of design.

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:05.337
We're taught to defend
our design against criticism.

00:11:05.774 --> 00:11:07.842
But I think that can change, too.

00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:11.566
So if we can focus the design mind

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.570
on creating positive,
reinforcing relationships

00:11:15.594 --> 00:11:17.574
in architecture and through architecture,

00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:21.464
I believe we can do much more
than create individual buildings.

00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:25.440
We can reduce the stress
and the polarization

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:27.028
in our urban habitats.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.145
We can create relationships.
