00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.120
I'm a relationship builder.

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:05.116
When you think of a relationship builder,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.440
don't you just automatically
think "architect?"

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.345
Probably not.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:14.283
That's because most people think
architects design buildings and cities,

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:16.661
but what we really design
are relationships,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.490
because cities are about people.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:22.896
They're places where people come together
for all kinds of exchange.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.137
And besides, skylines
are highly specific urban habitats

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.479
with their own insects,
plants and animals,

00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:30.136
and even their own weather.
