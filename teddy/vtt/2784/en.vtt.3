00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.432
called the Arcus Center.

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:34.624
They asked us for a building
that could break down traditional barriers

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:35.932
between different groups

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:40.203
and in doing so, create possibilities
for meaningful conversations

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:41.731
around social justice.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.890
The students wanted a place
for cultural exchange.

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:48.713
They thought a place for preparing
food together could do that.

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.468
And they wanted to be welcoming
to the outside community.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.155
They thought a fireplace
could draw people in

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.475
and help start conversations.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:01.018
And everybody wanted the work
of social justice to be visible
