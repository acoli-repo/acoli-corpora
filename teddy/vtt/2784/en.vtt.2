They look at how all the diverse parts
of the ecosystem are interconnected,

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:06.754
and it's actually this balance,
this web of life, that sustains life.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:11.860
My team and I have been applying
insights from ecology to architecture

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.878
to see how physical space
can help build stronger relationships.

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:18.266
The projects I'm going to show you today

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.993
use the idea of building relationships
as the key driver for design.

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:24.685
Here's an example of what I mean.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.858
Recently, we were asked to design
a center for social justice leadership

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.432
called the Arcus Center.
