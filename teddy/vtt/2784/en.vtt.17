It's called "Polis Station."

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.790
"Polis" is a Greek word that means
a place with a sense of community.

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:38.148
It's based on the idea

00:08:38.172 --> 00:08:42.109
that if you can increase opportunities
for positive social interactions

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.426
between police and community members,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.645
you can rebuild that relationship

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.383
and activate the neighborhood
at the same time.

00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:53.288
Instead of the police station
as a scary fortress,

00:08:53.312 --> 00:08:57.769
you get highly active spaces
on the public side of the station --

00:08:57.793 --> 00:08:59.303
places that spark conversation,

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:01.887
like a barbershop, a coffee shop
