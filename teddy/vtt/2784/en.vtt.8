00:03:56.442 --> 00:04:00.388
because it connects people
to each other and to the environment.

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:02.586
But is it working?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.876
Is it creating relationships
and nurturing them?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.218
How can we know?

00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:09.653
Well, more and more people
are coming here, for one,

00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:11.997
and as a result of the fireside chats

00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:14.119
and a full calendar of programming,

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.731
people are applying
for the Arcus Fellowships.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:21.054
In fact, applications have increased
tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.343
since the building opened.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.037
It's working. It's bringing
people together.

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:28.622
So I've shown how architecture
can connect people

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:30.804
on this kind of horizontal campus scale.
