(Laughter)

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:33.342
In meeting houses,
there's always a central space

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.017
where you can sit around a circle
and see each other.

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.062
So we designed a space just like that

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.065
right in the middle of the Arcus Center,

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.079
and we anchored it
with a fireplace and a kitchen.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.575
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen
and a fireplace in a building like this

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.803
with the building codes,

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:50.629
but it was so important
to the concept, we got it done.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:55.069
And now the central space
works for big social gatherings

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:58.331
and a place to meet one-on-one
for the very first time.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.434
It's almost like
this three-way intersection
