00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:32.737
It's about how do you design
to rebuild trust,

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.248
trusting relationships?

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.800
You know, every city has parks,
libraries, schools

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:40.218
and other public buildings

00:10:40.242 --> 00:10:44.428
that have the potential
to be reimagined as social connectors.

00:10:45.134 --> 00:10:49.164
But reimagining the buildings
for the future is going to require

00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:51.296
engaging the people who live there.

00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:55.867
Engaging the public can be intimidating,
and I've felt that, too.

00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:58.172
But maybe that's because
in architecture school,

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:02.203
we don't really learn how to engage
the public in the act of design.
