00:00:00.815 --> 00:00:02.450
I'd like to talk today

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.922
about how we can change our brains

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.515
and our society.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.690
Meet Joe.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.408
Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:16.150
I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.970
at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.971
I'd like you to imagine this place.

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.069
It looks and feels like it sounds:

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.451
Wormwood Scrubs.

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.675
Built at the end of the Victorian Era

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.187
by the inmates themselves,
