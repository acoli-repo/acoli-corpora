00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:30.953
was a project meant to preserve our last
chance for learning about the Holocaust

00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:32.745
from the survivors.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.396
It's called New Dimensions in Testimony,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.546
and it allows you to have
interactive conversations

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.126
with a hologram
of a real Holocaust survivor.

00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:43.759
(Video) Man: How did you
survive the Holocaust?

00:00:43.783 --> 00:00:45.451
(Video) Hologram: How did I survive?

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.719
I survived,

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:49.946
I believe,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.993
because providence watched over me.

00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:57.027
SS: Turns out these answers
were prerecorded in a studio.

00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:59.503
Yet the effect is astounding.

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:03.146
You feel so connected to his story
and to him as a person.
