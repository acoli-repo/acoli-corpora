00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:00.218
to detect fake images and videos,

00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:01.756
fighting against my own work.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:05.865
And one of the tools we plan to release
is called Reality Defender,

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.928
which is a web-browser plug-in
that can flag potentially fake content

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:12.485
automatically, right in the browser.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.737
(Applause)

00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.214
Despite all this, though,

00:06:18.238 --> 00:06:20.078
fake videos could do a lot of damage,

00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:23.396
even before anyone has a chance to verify,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.142
so it's very important
that we make everyone aware

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.173
of what's currently possible

00:06:28.197 --> 00:06:31.566
so we can have the right assumption
and be critical about what we see.
