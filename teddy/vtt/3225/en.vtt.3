00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:33.158
that can build a model of a person
using nothing but these:

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.961
existing photos and videos of a person.

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.318
If you can leverage
this kind of passive information,

00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:41.349
just photos and video that are out there,

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:43.429
that's the key to scaling to anyone.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.896
By the way, here's Richard Feynman,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.333
who in addition to being
a Nobel Prize winner in physics

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:51.810
was also known as a legendary teacher.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.278
Wouldn't it be great
if we could bring him back

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:58.567
to give his lectures
and inspire millions of kids,

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.583
perhaps not just in English
but in any language?
