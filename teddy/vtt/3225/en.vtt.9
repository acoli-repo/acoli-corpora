00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:31.419
So to do that, can we
actually teach the computer

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:33.665
to imitate the way someone talks

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.109
by only showing it
video footage of the person?

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.475
And what I did exactly was,
I let a computer watch

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.776
14 hours of pure Barack Obama
giving addresses.

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:46.959
And here's what we can produce
given only his audio.

00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:48.760
(Video) BO: The results are clear.

00:04:48.784 --> 00:04:53.133
America's businesses have created
14.5 million new jobs

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.931
over 75 straight months.

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:58.860
SS: So what's being synthesized here
is only the mouth region,

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.424
and here's how we do it.
