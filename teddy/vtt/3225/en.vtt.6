For George W. Bush,
we can just search on Google,

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.808
and from that, we are able
to build an average model,

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:07.943
an iterative, refined model
to recover the expression

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.303
in fine details,
like creases and wrinkles.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.729
What's fascinating about this

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.176
is that the photo collection
can come from your typical photos.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.803
It doesn't really matter
what expression you're making

00:03:18.827 --> 00:03:20.712
or where you took those photos.

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:23.136
What matters is
that there are a lot of them.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.896
And we are still missing color here,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.268
so next, we develop
a new blending technique

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.128
that improves upon
a single averaging method
