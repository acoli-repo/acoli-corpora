00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.128
that improves upon
a single averaging method

00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:32.970
and produces sharp
facial textures and colors.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.550
And this can be done for any expression.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.984
Now we have a control
of a model of a person,

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:43.803
and the way it's controlled now
is by a sequence of static photos.

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:46.953
Notice how the wrinkles come and go,
depending on the expression.

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.855
We can also use a video
to drive the model.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.472
(Video) Daniel Craig: Right, but somehow,

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:57.267
we've managed to attract
some more amazing people.

00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:59.663
SS: And here's another fun demo.

00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.933
So what you see here
are controllable models
