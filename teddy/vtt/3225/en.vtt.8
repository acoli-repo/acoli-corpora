00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.933
So what you see here
are controllable models

00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:04.401
of people I built
from their internet photos.

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:07.329
Now, if you transfer
the motion from the input video,

00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:09.505
we can actually drive the entire party.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:11.701
George W. Bush:
It's a difficult bill to pass,

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:14.028
because there's a lot of moving parts,

00:04:14.052 --> 00:04:19.283
and the legislative processes can be ugly.

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:22.798

our ultimate goal, rather,
is to capture their mannerisms

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:29.082
or the unique way each
of these people talks and smiles.

00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:31.419
So to do that, can we
actually teach the computer
