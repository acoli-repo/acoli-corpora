00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.884
that can reconstruct a high-detailed
3D face model from any image

00:02:30.908 --> 00:02:33.027
without ever 3D-scanning the person.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.532
And here's the same output model
from different views.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.471
This also works on videos,

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:42.347
by running the same algorithm
on each video frame

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.593
and generating a moving 3D model.

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:48.310
And here's the same
output model from different angles.

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.467
It turns out this problem
is very challenging,

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:55.016
but the key trick
is that we are going to analyze

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.006
a large photo collection
of the person beforehand.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.189
For George W. Bush,
we can just search on Google,
