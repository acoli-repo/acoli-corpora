00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.424
and here's how we do it.

00:05:00.764 --> 00:05:02.590
Our pipeline uses a neural network

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:05.550
to convert and input audio
into these mouth points.

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:10.772
(Video) BO: We get it through our job
or through Medicare or Medicaid.

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:14.216
SS: Then we synthesize the texture,
enhance details and teeth,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.314
and blend it into the head
and background from a source video.

00:05:17.338 --> 00:05:19.243
(Video) BO: Women can get free checkups,

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:22.235
and you can't get charged more
just for being a woman.

00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:26.279
Young people can stay
on a parent's plan until they turn 26.

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:30.219
SS: I think these results
seem very realistic and intriguing,
