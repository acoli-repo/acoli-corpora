00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:30.782
between the sacred and the trivial.

00:14:31.736 --> 00:14:34.012
And in this age,

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:37.534
where everything seems mapped,
measured and studied,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.756
in this age of information,

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:46.471
I remind you all that discoveries
are not just made

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:51.058
in the black void of the unknown

00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:55.562
but in the white noise
of overwhelming data.

00:14:57.862 --> 00:15:00.847
There remains so much to explore.
