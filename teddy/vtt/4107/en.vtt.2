00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.639
of warriors with poisoned arrows,

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:04.441
of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:09.217
spiders that ate birds,
snakes that swallowed men whole

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.525
and a river that boiled.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.779
All this became a childhood memory.

00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:16.962
And years passed.

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:19.461
I'm working on my PhD at SMU,

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:23.389
trying to understand
Peru's geothermal energy potential,

00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:25.459
when I remember this legend,

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:27.332
and I began asking that question.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.863
Could the boiling river exist?
