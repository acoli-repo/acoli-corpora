00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.863
Could the boiling river exist?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.339
I asked colleagues from universities,

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:35.520
the government,

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:37.037
oil, gas and mining companies,

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:39.967
and the answer was a unanimous no.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
And this makes sense.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.698
You see, boiling rivers
do exist in the world,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.181
but they're generally
associated with volcanoes.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.796
You need a powerful heat source

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.186
to produce such a large
geothermal manifestation.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.414
And as you can see from the red dots
here, which are volcanoes,

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.256
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,
