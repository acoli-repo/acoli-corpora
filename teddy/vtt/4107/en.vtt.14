Well, first off, it's not a legend.

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:03.642
Surprise!

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.991
(Laughter)

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:08.529
When I first started the research,

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.532
the satellite imagery was too
low-resolution to be meaningful.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.184
There were just no good maps.

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:16.145
Thanks to the support
of the Google Earth team,

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.514
I now have this.

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:24.601
Not only that, the indigenous name
of the river, Shanay-timpishka,

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:28.268
"boiled with the heat of the sun,"

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.919
indicating that I'm not the first
to wonder why the river boils,
