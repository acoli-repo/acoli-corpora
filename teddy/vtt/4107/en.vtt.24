00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.596
Where do we get this heat?

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:03.279
There's still more research to be done

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:06.492
to better constrain the problem
and better understand the system,

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.842
but from what the data is telling us now,

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:12.230
it looks to be the result
of a large hydrothermal system.

00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:14.611
Basically, it works like this:

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:17.943
So, the deeper you go
into the earth, the hotter it gets.

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:20.595
We refer to this
as the geothermal gradient.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.388
The waters could be coming
from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.411
then seeping down deep into the earth

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:31.202
and coming out to form the boiling river
