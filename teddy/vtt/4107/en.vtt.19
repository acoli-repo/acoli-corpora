00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:32.200
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:34.334
an extra-hot one, well, 60.

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:37.067
So, put in coffee shop terms,

00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:39.654
the boiling river plots like this.

00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:41.900
There you have your hot coffee.

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:44.630
Here you have your extra-hot coffee,

00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:46.828
and you can see
that there's a bit point there

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.840
where the river is still hotter
than even the extra-hot coffee.

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:51.856
And these are average water temperatures.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.079
We took these in the dry season to ensure
the purest geothermal temperatures.

00:09:56.603 --> 00:09:59.223
But there's a magic number here
that's not being shown,

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.777
and that number is 47 degrees C,
