But again, despite all of these studies,
all of these discoveries and the legends,

00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:07.499
a question remains:

00:13:09.704 --> 00:13:12.624
What is the significance
of the boiling river?

00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:19.247
What is the significance
of this stationary cloud

00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:22.147
that always hovers
over this patch of jungle?

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.983
And what is the significance

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:28.990
of a detail in a childhood legend?
