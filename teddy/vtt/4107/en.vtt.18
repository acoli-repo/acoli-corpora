00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:01.553
And the results were just awesome.

00:09:01.577 --> 00:09:04.730
Sorry -- the geoscientist
in me coming out.

00:09:04.754 --> 00:09:07.180
And it showed this amazing trend.

00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:09.420
You see, the river starts off cold.

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.439
It then heats up, cools back down,
heats up, cools back down,

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:15.081
heats up again, and then has
this beautiful decay curve

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.477
until it smashes into this cold river.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.333
Now, I understand not all of you
are geothermal scientists,

00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:23.582
so to put it in more everyday terms:

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:26.358
Everyone loves coffee.

00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:27.651
Yes? Good.

00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:32.200
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,
