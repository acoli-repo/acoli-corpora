00:10:57.468 --> 00:11:00.196
What's, again, amazing
are these temperatures.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.698
They're similar to things that I've seen
on volcanoes all over the world

00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:06.259
and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.204
But here's the thing:

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:15.172
the data is showing
that the boiling river exists

00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:17.486
independent of volcanism.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:21.911
It's neither magmatic
or volcanic in origin,

00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:29.925
and again, over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center.
