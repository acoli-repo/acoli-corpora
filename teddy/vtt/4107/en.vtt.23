00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:34.909
How can a boiling river exist like this?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.946
I've asked geothermal experts
and volcanologists for years,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.787
and I'm still unable to find another
non-volcanic geothermal system

00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:45.378
of this magnitude.

00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:48.645
It's unique.

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:52.931
It's special on a global scale.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:57.176
So, still -- how does it work?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.596
Where do we get this heat?
