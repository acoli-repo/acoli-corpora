00:13:31.547 --> 00:13:34.655
To the shaman and his community,
it's a sacred site.

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.759
To me, as a geoscientist,

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:40.626
it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.

00:13:42.074 --> 00:13:45.772
But to the illegal loggers
and cattle farmers,

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:49.439
it's just another resource to exploit.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.607
And to the Peruvian government,
it's just another stretch

00:13:54.631 --> 00:14:00.575
of unprotected land ready for development.
