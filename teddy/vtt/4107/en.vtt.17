00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:35.017
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.

00:08:36.223 --> 00:08:37.732
Truly impressive.

00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:42.077
There are thermal pools
larger than this TED stage,

00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:44.577
and that waterfall that you see there

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.639
is six meters tall --

00:08:47.384 --> 00:08:50.676
and all with near-boiling water.

00:08:52.243 --> 00:08:54.299
We mapped the temperatures
along the river,

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:57.441
and this was by far the most
demanding part of the fieldwork.

00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:01.553
And the results were just awesome.
