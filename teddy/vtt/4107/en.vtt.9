00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:30.559
I asked for tea.

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.823
I was handed a mug, a tea bag

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:35.175
and, well, pointed towards the river.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:40.584
To my surprise, the water was clean
and had a pleasant taste,

00:04:40.608 --> 00:04:43.602
which is a little weird
for geothermal systems.

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.989
What was amazing

00:04:46.013 --> 00:04:48.997
is that the locals had always
known about this place,

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:52.725
and that I was by no means
the first outsider to see it.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:56.638
It was just part of their everyday life.

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:59.809
They drink its water.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.388
They take in its vapor.
