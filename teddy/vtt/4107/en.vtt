00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:02.666
As a boy in Lima,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.801
my grandfather told me a legend

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.079
of the Spanish conquest of Peru.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.546
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
had been captured and killed.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.553
Pizarro and his conquistadors
had grown rich,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.763
and tales of their conquest
and glory had reached Spain

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:23.162
and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
hungry for gold and glory.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.953
They would go into towns and ask the Inca,

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:30.752
"Where's another civilization
we can conquer? Where's more gold?"
