00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.256
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.098
nor in most of Peru.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:08.390
So it follows: We should not expect
to see a boiling river.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.748
Telling this same story
at a family dinner,

00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:16.242
my aunt tells me,

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.248
"But no, Andrés, I've been there.
I've swum in that river."

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:24.535
(Laughter)

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.306
Then my uncle jumps in.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.060
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:33.067
You see, you can only swim in it
after a very heavy rain,
