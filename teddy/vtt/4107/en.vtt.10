00:05:04.127 --> 00:05:05.637
clean with it,

00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:07.459
even make their medicines with it.

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:10.840
I met the shaman,

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:15.053

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:27.944

to be honest with you --

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:32.247
a smile began to snake across his face,
and he just laughed.
