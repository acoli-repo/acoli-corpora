00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:33.712
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:37.298
The temperature differential
made it all white. It was a whiteout.

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.361
Intense.

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:44.596
Now, after years of work,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.262
I'll soon be submitting my geophysical
and geochemical studies for publication.

00:06:51.047 --> 00:06:55.022
And I'd like to share, today,
with all of you here, on the TED stage,

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:58.236
for the first time,
some of these discoveries.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.871
Well, first off, it's not a legend.
