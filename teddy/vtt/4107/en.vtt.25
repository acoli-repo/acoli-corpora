00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:31.202
and coming out to form the boiling river

00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:34.233
after getting heated up
from the geothermal gradient,

00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:37.550
all due to this unique geologic setting.

00:12:38.587 --> 00:12:41.434
Now, we found
that in and around the river --

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.951
this is working with colleagues

00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:45.062
from National Geographic,
Dr. Spencer Wells,

00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:47.796
and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.082
we genetically sequenced
the extremophile lifeforms

00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:55.710
living in and around the river,
and have found new lifeforms,

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.149
unique species living
in the boiling river.
