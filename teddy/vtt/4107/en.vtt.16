00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:04.330
so, too, the earth has hot water
running through its cracks and faults.

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:08.757
Where these arteries come to the surface,
these earth arteries,

00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:11.155
we'll get geothermal manifestations:

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:15.199
fumaroles, hot springs
and in our case, the boiling river.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:20.559
What's truly incredible, though,
is the scale of this place.

00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.567
Next time you cross the road,
think about this.

00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:27.199
The river flows wider than a two-lane road

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:29.087
along most of its path.

00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:35.017
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.
