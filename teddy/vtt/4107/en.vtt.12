00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:02.859
I've been back every year
since that first visit in 2011,

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:06.308
and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:10.129
demanding and at times dangerous.

00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:14.128
One story was even featured
in National Geographic Magazine.

00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:18.239
I was trapped on a small rock
about the size of a sheet of paper

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.303
in sandals and board shorts,

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.733
in between an 80 degree C river

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:26.486
and a hot spring that, well,
looked like this, close to boiling.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.608
And on top of that,
it was Amazon rain forest.
