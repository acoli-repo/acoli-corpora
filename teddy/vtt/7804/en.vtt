Shahed Alam: In the fall of 2021,

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:05.585
I arrived in the US to visit my parents

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:08.212
after almost two years
of not seeing one another.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.215
I was coming from my home
in Bangalore, in India,

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:14.052
where we were just getting out
of a devastating second wave

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:15.386
of the pandemic.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:19.724
Within weeks of my arrival,
first my father, then me,

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.310
then my mother, all came down with COVID.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.312
And it hit us hard.

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.607
My parents' age
and their medical conditions

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:30.276
threatened to make each day
more severe than the last.
