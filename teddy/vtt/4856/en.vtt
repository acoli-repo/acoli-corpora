The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.921
to create thousands of expressions.

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.840
But do these expressions look the same

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.352
and communicate the same
meaning around the world,

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.959
regardless of culture?

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.991
Is one person’s smile another’s grimace?

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:29.521
Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature.

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.290
But he was in the minority.
