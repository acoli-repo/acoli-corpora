00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:01.502
might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology.

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:03.293
The fear expression, for instance,

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:07.363
could directly improve survival 
in potentially dangerous situations

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:09.542
by letting our eyes absorb more light

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:14.553
and our lungs take in more air, 
preparing us to fight or flee.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:18.144
There’s still much research to be done 
in understanding emotional expression,

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:21.863
particularly as we learn more about 
the inner workings of the brain.

00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:25.003
But if you ever find yourself 
among strangers in a strange land,

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.593
a friendly smile could go a long way.
