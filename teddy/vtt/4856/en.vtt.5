00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:33.296
disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling.

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:38.208
In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.370
and the mouth stretches open,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.168
while surprise looks similar,

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:46.052
but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips.

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:49.212
Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows

00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:51.418
being drawn inwards and upwards,

00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:52.553
drooping eyes,

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:54.644
and a downturned mouth.

00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.527
And of course there’s happiness:

00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.597
lips drawn up and back,

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.969
and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes.
