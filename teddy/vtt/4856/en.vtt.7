00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.250
One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.560
Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.860
Studies of humans and some other primates

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.311
have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats

00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:42.922
over neutral faces,

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.291
particularly when we’re already 
on high alert.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.024
Expressions also could 
help improve group fitness

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:51.680
by communicating our internal states 
to those around us.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.023
Sadness, for example, signals to the group
that something’s wrong.

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:58.012
There’s some evidence that expressions

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:01.502
might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology.
