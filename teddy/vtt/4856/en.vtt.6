00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.969
and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.530
More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.781
such as contempt,

00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:07.798
shame,

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:09.479
and disapproval,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.679
but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.780
between these categories can be drawn.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.937
So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct,

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.299
what makes certain expressions universal?

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.781
And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways?

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.460
Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.250
One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival.
