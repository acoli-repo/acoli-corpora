that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.325
The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however,

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.983
vary greatly across cultures.

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:43.965
For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.735
in people who are born blind,

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.507
hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:52.355
they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.276
In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes

00:01:55.276 --> 00:02:00.215
displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches.
