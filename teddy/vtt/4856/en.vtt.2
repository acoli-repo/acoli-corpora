00:00:58.063 --> 00:01:00.613
by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:04.581
of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world.

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:08.633
Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar,

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:12.664
but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect.

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:18.244
Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.964
They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:25.794
with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.204
Over the next few decades,

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:29.807
further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:34.375
that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal.
