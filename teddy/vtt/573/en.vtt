00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:05.768
So I've got something that I'm
slightly embarrassed to admit to.

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:07.351
At the age of 17,

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:09.184
as a creationist,

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.809
I decided to go to university
to study evolution

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.434
so that I could destroy it.

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:16.143
(Laughter)

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:17.434
I failed.

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:21.309
I failed so spectacularly
that I'm now an evolutionary biologist.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.143
(Applause)

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.476
So I'm a paleoanthropologist,
I'm a National Geographic Explorer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.143
specializing in fossil hunting in caves
