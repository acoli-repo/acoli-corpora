00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to talk today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the pleasures of everyday life.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But I want to begin with a story

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of an unusual and terrible man.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Hermann Goering.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
his designated successor.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And like Hitler,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Goering fancied himself a collector of art.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He went through Europe, through World War II,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
stealing, extorting and occasionally buying

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
various paintings for his collection.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.
