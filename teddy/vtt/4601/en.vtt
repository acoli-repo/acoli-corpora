00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.098
Why do cats do that?

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:14.375
They're cute, they're lovable,

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:19.847
and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:21.068
of them pouncing,

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:21.975
bouncing,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:22.841
climbing,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:23.639
cramming,

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:24.540
stalking,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.290
clawing,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.031
chattering,

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:27.083
and purring,

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.921
one thing is certain:

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.041
cats are very entertaining.
