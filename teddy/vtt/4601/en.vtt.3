00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.887
in her food bowl today,

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:34.357
but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase

00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:37.911
is exactly what she has evolved to do.

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:44.122
As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:45.980
Since most cat prey are small,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.651
cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:54.991
and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.862
This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys

00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:02.860
and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night.
