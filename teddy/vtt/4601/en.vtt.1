00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.041
cats are very entertaining.

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.328
These somewhat strange feline behaviors,

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.392
both amusing and baffling,

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:40.576
leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?"

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:45.983
Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.198
and prey for larger carnivores.

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:50.784
As both predator and prey,

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:55.609
survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.635
which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today.
