00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.789
it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.292
is still one of the most mysterious.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:37.623
Cats may purr for any number of reasons,

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:38.809
such as happiness,

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:39.838
stress,

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:41.131
and hunger.

00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:43.726
But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs,

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.466
between 25 and 150 hertz,

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:51.292
is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration.

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.777
So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion,

00:03:54.777 --> 00:04:00.118
it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones,
