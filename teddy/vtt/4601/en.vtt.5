00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:30.181
In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense.

00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:34.778
Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready,

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:36.901
helped stretch their back and leg muscles,

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.321
and relieve some stress, too.

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:41.451
So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch,

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.287
chair,

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.272
ottoman,

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.017
pillows,

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:44.794
curtains,

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:47.499
and everything else 
you put in her environment.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.134
She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape

00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:57.763
because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive.

00:02:57.763 --> 00:02:59.506
As animals that were preyed upon,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:01.883
cats evolved to not get caught,
