00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.616
is to understand

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.056
that the political divide in our country
is undergirded by a deeper moral divide.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.856
So one of the most robust findings
in the history of political psychology

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.576
is this pattern identified
by Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.816
psychologists,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.856
that liberals and conservatives
tend to endorse different values

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080
to different degrees.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.096
So for example, we find that liberals
tend to endorse values like equality

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.776
and fairness and care
and protection from harm

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.936
more than conservatives do.
