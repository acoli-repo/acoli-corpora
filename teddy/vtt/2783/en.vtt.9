00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.336
where we recruited liberals to a study

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.816
where they were supposed
to write a persuasive essay

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.280
that would be compelling to a conservative
in support of same-sex marriage.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.056
And what we found was that liberals
tended to make arguments

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.256
in terms of the liberal moral values
of equality and fairness.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.016
So they said things like,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.416
"Everyone should have the right
to love whoever they choose,"

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.016
and, "They" -- they being gay Americans --

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.800
"deserve the same equal rights
as other Americans."

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.576
Overall, we found
that 69 percent of liberals
