Overall, we found
that 69 percent of liberals

invoked one of the more liberal
moral values in constructing their essay,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.736

even though they were supposed
to be trying to persuade conservatives.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.496
And when we studied conservatives
and had them make persuasive arguments

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.856
59 percent of them made arguments

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.576
in terms of one of the more
conservative moral values,
