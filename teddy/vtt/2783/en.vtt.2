00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.160
more and more they just
don't like one another.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.336
You see it in many different ways.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.016
They don't want to befriend one another.
They don't want to date one another.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.336
If they do, if they find out,
they find each other less attractive,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.456
and they more and more don't want
their children to marry someone

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.176
who supports the other party,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960
a particularly shocking statistic.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.456
You know, in my lab,
the students that I work with,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.936
we're talking about
some sort of social pattern --

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.496
I'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.480
what kind of movie are we in here
with this pattern?
