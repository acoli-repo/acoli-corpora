What can we do to chip away

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.416
What could we do to connect with
and communicate with

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.160
our political counterparts?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.856
Well, these were exactly the questions
that I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.738
became fascinated with a few years ago,

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:21.962
and we started

for understanding polarization

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.616
is to understand
