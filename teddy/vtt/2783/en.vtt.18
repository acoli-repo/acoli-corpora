Why --

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.816
(Laughter)

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.880
It's incredibly intuitive.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.696
And even though it is,
it's something we really struggle to do.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.576
You know, it turns out that when we go
to persuade somebody on a political issue,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.336
we talk like we're speaking into a mirror.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.736
We don't persuade so much
as we rehearse our own reasons

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.640
for why we believe
some sort of political position.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.816
We kept saying when we were designing
these reframed moral arguments,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.480
"Empathy and respect,
empathy and respect."
