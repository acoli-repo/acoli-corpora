And conservatives tend to endorse
values like loyalty, patriotism,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.976
And Matt and I were thinking

for understanding how it is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.536
that liberals and conservatives

So we conducted a study

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.336
where we recruited liberals to a study
