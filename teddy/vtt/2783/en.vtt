00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.816
So you probably have the sense,
as most people do,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.496
that polarization
is getting worse in our country,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.976
that the divide
between the left and the right

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.536
is as bad as it's been
in really any of our lifetimes.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.840
But you might also reasonably wonder
if research backs up your intuition.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.240
And in a nutshell,
the answer is sadly yes.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.936
In study after study, we find

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.640
that liberals and conservatives
have grown further apart.
