just have to change his view,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.886

So what would work better?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.496
Well, we believe it's a technique
that we call moral reframing,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.136
and we've studied it

And the first of these essays

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.536
was a relatively conventional
pro-environmental essay
