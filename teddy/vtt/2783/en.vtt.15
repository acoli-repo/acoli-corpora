00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.856
They tended to have highly
pro-environmental attitudes regardless.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.296
Liberals are on board
for environmental protection.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.536
Conservatives, however,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.976
were significantly more supportive
of progressive environmental policies

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.536
and environmental protection

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.616
if they had read the moral purity essay

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.040
than if they read
one of the other two essays.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.256
We even found that conservatives
who read the moral purity essay

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.776
were significantly more likely to say
that they believed in global warming

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.705
and were concerned about global warming,

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:59.456
even though this essay
didn't even mention global warming.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.936
That's just a related environmental issue.
