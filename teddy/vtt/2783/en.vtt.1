00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.640
that liberals and conservatives
have grown further apart.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.216
They increasingly wall themselves off
in these ideological silos,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.376
consuming different news,
talking only to like-minded others

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.640
and more and more choosing
to live in different parts of the country.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.936
And I think that
most alarming of all of it

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.760
is seeing this rising
animosity on both sides.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.096
Liberals and conservatives,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.016
Democrats and Republicans,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.160
more and more they just
don't like one another.
