00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.960
"Keeping our forests, drinking water,
and skies pure is of vital importance."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.496
"We should regard the pollution

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.560
of the places we live in
to be disgusting."

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.256
And, "Reducing pollution
can help us preserve

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.440
what is pure and beautiful
about the places we live."

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.296
And then we had a third group

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.816
that were assigned
to read just a nonpolitical essay.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.576
It was just a comparison group
so we could get a baseline.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.553
And what we found when we surveyed people

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.776
about their environmental
attitudes afterwards,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.736
we found that liberals,
it didn't matter what essay they read.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.856
They tended to have highly
pro-environmental attitudes regardless.
