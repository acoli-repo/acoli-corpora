00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.246
Take a deep breath.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:12.413
In that single intake of air,

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:17.204
your lungs swelled with roughly
25 sextillion molecules,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.579
ranging from compounds produced days ago,

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.621
to those formed billions of years 
in the past.

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.954
In fact, many of the molecules 
youâ€™re breathing were likely

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:29.204
exhaled by members 
of ancient civilizations

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.454
and innumerable humans since.
