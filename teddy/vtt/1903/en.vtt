Well, the subject of difficult negotiation

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:06.976
reminds me of one of my favorite stories
from the Middle East,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.754
of a man who left
to his three sons, 17 camels.

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.976
To the first son, he left half the camels;

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.390
to the second son,
he left a third of the camels;

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.009
and to the youngest son,
he left a ninth of the camels.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:21.847
The three sons got into a negotiation --
17 doesn't divide by two.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.609
It doesn't divide by three.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.172
It doesn't divide by nine.

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:27.442
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.745
Finally, in desperation,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.430
they went and they consulted
a wise old woman.
