00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.289
more timely imaging?

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.740
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.251
that we were going to go out and just

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.098
begin designing satellites,

00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:39.061
but fortunately we had help.

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:41.996
In the late 1990s, a couple of professors

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:45.477
proposed a concept for radically reducing the price

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:47.249
of putting things in space.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.360
This was hitchhiking small satellites

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.376
alongside much larger satellites.

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:55.285
This dropped the cost of putting objects up there

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:57.283
by over a factor of 100,

00:03:57.283 --> 00:04:00.369
and suddenly we could afford to experiment,
