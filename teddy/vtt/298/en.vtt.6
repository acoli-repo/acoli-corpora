00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.891
and even the areas that are seen most frequently,

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.639
those in red, are seen at best once a quarter.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.555
Now as aerospace engineering grad students,

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.983
this chart cried out to us as a challenge.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.438
Why do these things have to be so expensive?

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:18.173
Does a single satellite really have to cost

00:03:18.173 --> 00:03:22.936
the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.099
Wasn't there a way to build a smaller,

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.271
simpler, new satellite design that could enable

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.289
more timely imaging?
