00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:32.155
Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration

00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:35.216
ready to blast off in a few short weeks.

00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:37.558
And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:40.589
a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:43.139
and beginning to build the scalable analytics

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.478
that will allow us to unearth the insights

00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:48.667
in the petabytes of data we will collect.

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:52.640
So why do all of this? Why build these satellites?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.251
Well, it turns out imaging satellites

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:58.961
have a unique ability to provide global transparency,

00:08:58.961 --> 00:09:01.587
and providing that transparency on a timely basis
