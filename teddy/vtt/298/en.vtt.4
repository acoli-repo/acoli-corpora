00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:02.796
During this period, launching things into space,

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:05.473
just the rocket to get the satellite up there,

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:10.074
has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:11.826
and that's created tremendous pressure

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:14.115
to launch things infrequently

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:15.459
and to make sure that when you do,

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.098
you cram as much functionality in there as possible.

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.709
All of this has only made satellites

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.126
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.724
and more expensive,

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:29.761
now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.460
Because they are so expensive,
