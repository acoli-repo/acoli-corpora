WEBVTT

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.575
into very high-quality images

00:08:00.575 --> 00:08:03.168
using sophisticated pixel processing techniques

00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:04.689
here on the ground,

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:07.826
at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:08.979
And we applied this technique

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.953
to many of the other systems on the satellite as well,

00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:14.793
and day by day, our design evolved

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:18.282
from CAD to prototypes

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:21.170
to production units.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.827
A few short weeks ago,

00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:24.678
we packed up SkySat 1,

00:08:24.678 --> 00:08:26.451
put our signatures on it,

00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:28.674
and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:32.155
Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration
