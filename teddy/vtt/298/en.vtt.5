00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:31.460
Because they are so expensive,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.927
there aren't very many of them.

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:34.272
Because there aren't very many of them,

00:02:34.272 --> 00:02:36.728
the pictures that we see on a daily basis

00:02:36.728 --> 00:02:38.232
tend to be old.

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.514
I think a lot of people actually
understand this anecdotally,

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.053
but in order to visualize just how sparsely

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:45.937
our planet is collected,

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:48.003
some friends and I put together a dataset

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.590
of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.074
by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:56.829
As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.619
are barely seen, less than once a year,

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.891
and even the areas that are seen most frequently,
