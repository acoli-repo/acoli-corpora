00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:01.554
and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.992
that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:06.892
The big challenge became actually taking

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.090
the pictures through that telescope.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.134
Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,

00:07:12.134 --> 00:07:13.895
similar to a Xerox machine,

00:07:13.895 --> 00:07:16.295
and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:18.491
scanning row by row by row

00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:20.166
to build the complete image.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:23.170
Now people use these because they get a lot of light,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.001
which means less of the noise you see

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:27.752
in a low-cost cell phone image.

00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:30.113
The problem with them is they require
