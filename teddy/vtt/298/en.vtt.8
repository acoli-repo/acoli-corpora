00:03:57.283 --> 00:04:00.369
and suddenly we could afford to experiment,

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.837
to take a little bit of risk,

00:04:01.837 --> 00:04:04.103
and to realize a lot of innovation.

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:07.192
And a new generation of engineers and scientists,

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:08.791
mostly out of universities,

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.134
began launching these very small,

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:13.725
breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.

00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:16.128
And these were built with electronics obtained

00:04:16.128 --> 00:04:20.026
from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.866
Now it was using the lessons
learned from these early missions

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.561
that my friends and I began a series of sketches

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:27.250
of our own satellite design.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.034
And I can't remember a specific day
