00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.457
that move around our world on a daily basis,

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:34.261
while conveniently still not
being able to see individuals.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.882
We had found our compromise.

00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:37.486
We would have to build something larger

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:39.049
than the original breadbox,

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:40.700
now more like a mini-fridge,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.461
but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.

00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.085
So now we had our constraint.

00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:47.842
The laws of physics dictated

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:51.166
the absolute minimum-sized
telescope that we could build.

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.220
What came next was making the rest of the satellite

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.961
as small and as simple as possible,

00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.613
basically a flying telescope with four walls

00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:01.554
and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book
