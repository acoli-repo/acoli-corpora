00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:00.086
it had relatively little relevance

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.546
to the work that I was doing today.

00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:04.007
But I was intrigued.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.243
I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:09.546
There are millions and millions of sensors

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:10.990
surrounding us today,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.950
but there's still so much we
don't know on a daily basis.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.703
How much oil is stored in all of China?

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.636
How much corn is being produced?

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:24.707
How many ships are in all of our world's ports?

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:27.266
Now, in theory, all of these questions

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.510
could be answered by imagery,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.237
but not if it's old.
