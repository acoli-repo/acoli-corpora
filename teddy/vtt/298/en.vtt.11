00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:30.609
that the best picture you
can take through a telescope

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:32.848
is a function of the diameter of that telescope,

00:05:32.848 --> 00:05:34.510
and these satellites had a very small,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.216
very constrained volume.

00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.011
And we found that the best picture we would

00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.496
have been able to get looked something like this.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:42.741
Although this was the low-cost option,

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.414
quite frankly it was just too blurry

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:47.983
to see the things that make
satellite imagery valuable.

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:50.129
So about three or four weeks later,

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.946
we met a group of engineers randomly

00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:54.587
who had worked on the first

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:57.028
private imaging satellite ever developed,

00:05:57.028 --> 00:05:59.146
and they told us that back in the 1970s,

00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.328
the U.S. government had found a powerful
