00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:30.113
The problem with them is they require

00:07:30.113 --> 00:07:32.353
very sophisticated pointing.

00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:34.899
You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:36.651
from over 600 miles away

00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:38.883
while moving at more than
seven kilometers a second,

00:07:38.883 --> 00:07:41.632
which requires an awesome degree of complexity.

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:45.069
So instead, we turned to a new
generation of video sensors,

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.160
originally created for use in night vision goggles.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.059
Instead of taking a single, high quality image,

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:52.446
we could take a videostream

00:07:52.446 --> 00:07:55.369
of individually noisier frames,

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:57.113
but then we could recombine

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:58.579
all of those frames together

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.575
into very high-quality images
