00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:31.239
And one day, I was thinking about how

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.363
all data has a location,

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:35.096
and I realized that the answer

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:36.984
had been staring me in the face.

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:39.622
Although I was a satellite engineer,

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.793
I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:44.359
in my work.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.306
Now, like most of us, I'd been online,

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:48.088
I'd see my house, so I thought,

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:50.386
I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:51.803
some of these facilities.

00:00:51.803 --> 00:00:53.772
And what I found really surprised me.

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:55.446
The pictures that I was finding

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:57.347
were years out of date,

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:58.415
and because of that,

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:00.086
it had relatively little relevance
