00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.034
And I can't remember a specific day

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:31.894
where we made a conscious decision

00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:34.529
that we were actually going to
go out and build these things,

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.959
but once we got that idea in our minds

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.120
of the world as a dataset,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.610
of being able to capture millions of data points

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.663
on a daily basis describing the global economy,

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:47.183
of being able to unearth billions of connections

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:50.348
between them that had never before been found,

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:51.996
it just seemed boring

00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:54.903
to go work on anything else.

00:04:54.903 --> 00:04:57.876
And so we moved into a cramped,

00:04:57.876 --> 00:05:00.855
