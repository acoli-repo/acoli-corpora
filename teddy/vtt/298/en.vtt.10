00:04:57.876 --> 00:05:00.855
windowless office in Palo Alto,

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:02.822
and began working to take our design

00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:05.760
from the drawing board into the lab.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.418
The first major question we had to tackle

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:10.752
was just how big to build this thing.

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:13.935
In space, size drives cost,

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:15.948
and we had worked with these very small,

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.042
breadbox-sized satellites in school,

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.593
but as we began to better
understand the laws of physics,

00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:22.715
we found that the quality of pictures

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:25.799
those satellites could take was very limited,

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:27.503
because the laws of physics dictate

00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:30.609
that the best picture you
can take through a telescope
