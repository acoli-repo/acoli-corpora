00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.237
but not if it's old.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:33.695
And if this data was so valuable,

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.627
then how come I couldn't get my hands

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:38.177
on more recent pictures?

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:41.312
So the story begins over 50 years ago

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.183
with the launch of the first generation

00:01:43.183 --> 00:01:46.783
of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:48.479
And today, there's a handful

of the great, great grandchildren

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:52.339
of these early Cold War machines

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.348
which are now operated by private companies

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:57.057
and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery

00:01:57.057 --> 00:01:59.882
that you and I see on a daily basis comes.

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:02.796
During this period, launching things into space,
