Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student

00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:04.741
living two lives.

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.057
In one, I used NASA supercomputers

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.785
to design next-generation spacecraft,

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:12.364
and in the other I was a data scientist

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.783
looking for potential smugglers

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.022
of sensitive nuclear technologies.

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:20.881
As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:22.348
mostly of facilities,

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.619
industrial facilities around the world.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.307
And I was always looking for a better canvas

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.373
to tie these all together.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:31.239
And one day, I was thinking about how
