00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.540
In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time,

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:32.965
the temperature of the area

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.461
needs to be hotter than the Sun.

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:39.749
Every innocent bystander
will be burned to a crisp.

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:44.043
Rapid nuclear fission is not any better

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.284
since it often results
in many radioactive particles.

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:48.482
Our hero would become

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:51.521
a walking, talking nuclear power plant,

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:55.147
ultimately harming
every person he tries to save.

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:57.734
And do you really want the heat of the Sun

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:02.023
or a radioactive nuclear
plant inside of your body?
