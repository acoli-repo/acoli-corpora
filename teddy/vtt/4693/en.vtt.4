00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:00.823
without the alarm going off.

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.707
Now, option two seems a little more

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.962
scientifically plausible,

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:05.909
but it begs the question,

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.629
how does he ever walk through the park

00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:08.874
without sinking into the ground

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.108
since the pressure
he is exerting on the soil

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.550
is calculated by his mass

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:15.795
divided by the area
of the bottom of his feet?

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.383
And what kind of super
socks and super shoes

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:21.464
is he putting on his feet
to withstand all the friction

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:25.098
that results from dragging
his 5,400 pound body

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:28.625
against the road when he runs?

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.303
And can he even run?
