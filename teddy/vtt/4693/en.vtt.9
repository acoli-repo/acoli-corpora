in order to afford all the food he eats.

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:32.895
And what about superheroes

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.903
who can turn their bodies
into rocks or sand?

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.571
Well, everything on Earth
is made out of elements.

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:39.976
And what defines each element

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.074
is the number of protons in the nucleus.

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.450
That is how our periodic
table is organized.

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.288
Hydrogen has one proton,

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:48.873
helium, two protons,

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:50.063
lithium, three protons,

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:51.290
and so on.

00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:53.457
The primary component
of the most common form

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.379
of sand is silicon dioxide.

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.632
Meanwhile, the human body consists of

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.384
65% oxygen,

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:00.936
18% carbon,
