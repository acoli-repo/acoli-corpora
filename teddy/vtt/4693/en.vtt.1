00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.084
that mass can neither be created

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:32.248
nor destroyed,

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:33.918
which means that our hero's mass

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.858
will not change just
because his size changes.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:42.212
For instance, when we bake
a fluffy sponge cake,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.189
even though the resulting delicious treat

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.667
is much bigger in size
than the cake batter

00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:48.182
that went into the oven,

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.802
the weight of the cake
batter should still equal

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:51.977
the weight of the cake

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.671
plus the moisture that has evaporated.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:56.954
In a chemical equation,

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.565
molecules rearrange to make new compounds,

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.258
but all the components should
still be accounted for.
