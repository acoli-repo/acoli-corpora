00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:00.832
then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size.

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.987
When he expands to a bigger size

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.644
while still weighing 200 pounds,

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.483
he essentially turns himself

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:10.003
into a giant, fluffy teddy bear.

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.195
In option two, if the hero weighs

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.118
5,400 pounds all the time,

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:20.207
then he would be bones
and flesh at 18 feet

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.044
with 5,400 pounds of weight
supported by two legs.

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:26.164
The weight would be
exerted on the leg bones

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.831
at different angles as he moves.

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.159
Bones, while hard, are not malleable,
