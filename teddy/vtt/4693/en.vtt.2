00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.258
but all the components should
still be accounted for.

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.149
When our hero expands

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:07.022
from 6 feet tall

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.404
to 18 feet tall,

00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:11.741
his height triples.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.669
Galileo's Square Cube Law says

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:15.828
his weight will be 27

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.287
- 3 times 3 times 3 equals 27 -

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.499
times his regular weight

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:22.997
since he has to expand
in all three dimensions.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.542
So, when our superhero
transforms into a giant,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.214
we are dealing with two possibilities.

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.633
Our hero towering at 18 feet
