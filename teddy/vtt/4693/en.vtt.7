00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.159
Bones, while hard, are not malleable,

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:31.782
meaning they do not bend,

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.874
so they break easily.

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:36.211
The tendons would also
be at risk of tearing.

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.148
Tall buildings stay standing

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.962
because they have steel frames

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.842
and do not run and jump
around in the jungle.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.010
Our hero, on the other hand,

00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:46.814
one landing at a bad angle

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:48.631
and he's down.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.190
Assuming his bodily function
is the same as any mammal's,

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.691
his heart would need to pump
a large amount of blood

00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:59.889
throughout his body
to provide enough oxygen

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:03.100
for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around.
