00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.633
Our hero towering at 18 feet

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.521
still only weighs 200 pounds,

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.970
the original weight in this human form.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:42.102
Now, option two, our hero
weighs 5,400 pounds

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:46.554
- 200 pounds times 27
equals 5,400 pounds -

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.180
when he is 18 feet tall,

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:52.515
which means he also weighs 5,400 pounds

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.732
when he is 6 feet tall.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.040
Nobody can get in the same
elevator with him

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:00.823
without the alarm going off.
