00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.303
And can he even run?

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:32.649
And I won't even ask how he finds pants

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.716
flexible enough to withstand
the expansion.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.326
Now, let's explore the density

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.832
of the two options mentioned above.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:48.883
Density is defined as mass
divided by volume.

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.745
The human body is made
out of bones and flesh,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.387
which has a relatively set density.

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.634
In option one, if the hero
weighs 200 pounds all the time,

00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:00.832
then he would be bones
and flesh at normal size.
