00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:00.936
18% carbon,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.091
10% hydrogen,

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.556
and 7% of various other elements

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.806
including 0.002% of silicon.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.031
In a chemical reaction,

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:12.813
the elements recombine
to make new compounds.

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:14.774
So, where is he getting all this silicon

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.517
necessary to make the sand?

00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.070
Sure, we can alter elements

00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:21.874
by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission.

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:25.025
However, nuclear fusion
requires so much heat,

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.811
the only natural occurrence
of this process is in stars.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.540
In order to utilize fusion
in a short amount of time,
