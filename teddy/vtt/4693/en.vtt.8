00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:03.100
for him to move 5,400 pounds
of body weight around.

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.233
This would take tremendous energy,

00:04:05.257 --> 00:04:06.686
which he would need to provide

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.264
by consuming 27 times 3,000
calories of food every day.

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:14.913
Now, that is roughly 150 Big Macs.

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:17.273
27 times 3,000 calculated equals

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:20.794
81,000 calculated slash 550 calories

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:22.256
equals 147.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.122
He wouldn't have time to fight crime

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.400
because he would be eating all the time

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.429
and working a 9-to-5 job

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:31.932
in order to afford all the food he eats.
