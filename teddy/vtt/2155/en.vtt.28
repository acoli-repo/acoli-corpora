00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
which means that monkey

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
became the first primate in the history of the world

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to have three independent functional arms.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And it's not just technology

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that we're putting into animals.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
He took 20,000 and then 60,000

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
disaggregated rat neurons --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
so these are just individual neurons from rats --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
put them on a chip.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They self-aggregated into a network,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
became an integrated chip.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And he used that
