00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And now, using a joystick,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
they can send this creature

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
around the lab

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and control whether it goes left or right,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
forwards or backwards.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They've created a kind of insect bot,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
or bugbot.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This actually is one of DARPA's very important --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
one of their projects.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
These goliath beetles

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
are wired in their wings.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.
