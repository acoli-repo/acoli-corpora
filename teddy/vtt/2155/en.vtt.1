00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, as you all know,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
species lived in particular ecological niches

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and particular environments,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the pressures of those environments

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
selected which changes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
through random mutation in species,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
were going to be preserved.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then human beings stepped out

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and created the second great wave of evolution,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which was we changed the environment

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in which we evolved.
