00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We have our nucleic DNA

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that everybody thinks of as our DNA,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which are the energy packets of the cell.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So really, what you end up having here

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
is not a guar and not a mouflon,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
but a guar

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with cow mitochondria,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and a mouflon with another species of sheep's

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
mitochondrial DNA.
