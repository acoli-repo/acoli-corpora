00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and for our species, as well as our cultures,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
because of this change.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We started selectively breeding animals

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
many, many thousands of years ago.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And if you think of dogs for example,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Dogs are the result

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of selectively breeding traits that we like.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days
