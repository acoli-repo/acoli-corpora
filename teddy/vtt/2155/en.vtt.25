00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Again, it's got technology --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
it's got a camera on top of its head.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The scientists can make this creature

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
go left, right.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
They've now created an organic robot.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The graduate students

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in Sanjiv Talwar's lab

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
said, "Is this ethical?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'll get back to that in a minute.
