00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to try to save endangered species.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is the use of animals now

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to create drugs and other things in their bodies

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that we want to create.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So with antithrombin in that goat --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that goat has been genetically modified

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
so that the molecules of its milk

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
actually include the molecule of antithrombin

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that GTC Genetics wants to create.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,
