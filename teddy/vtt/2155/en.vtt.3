00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now we're entering a third great wave

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of evolutionary history,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
which has been called many things:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"intentional evolution,"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
"evolution by design" --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
very different than intelligent design --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
whereby we are actually now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
intentionally designing and altering

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then at the end talk a little bit

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
about what some of the implications are for us

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and for our species, as well as our cultures,
