00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
created in South Korea

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
by the very same man that some of you may remember

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
had to end up resigning in disgrace

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
He actually was the first person

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
because dog genomes are very plastic.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,

a real "gold ring" of cloning,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
because there are many horses that win important races

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
who are geldings.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud
