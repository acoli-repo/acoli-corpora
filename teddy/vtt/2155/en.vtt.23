00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They can't actually make them land.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
They put them about one inch above the ground,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that this creature --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
this is a moth --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
this is the moth in its pupa stage,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and that's when they put the wires in

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and they put in the computer technology,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,
