00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The scientists that made this cute little creature

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I think they said it tasted like chicken.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is a cama.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with some of the personality traits

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of a llama.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And they are now using these in certain cultures.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Then there's the liger.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is the largest cat in the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the lion-tiger hybrid.
