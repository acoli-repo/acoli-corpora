00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with these electrodes going off to the sides,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
put it into a cart --

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the cart moves toward the light;

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
when you turn it off, it moves away.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It's photophilic.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So now we have a complete

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
living lamprey eel brain.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
sitting there in its nutrient medium?
