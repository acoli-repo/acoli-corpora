00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
in order to save endangered species.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
The guar

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
A somatic cell, a body cell,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
was taken from its body,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
gestated in the ovum of a cow,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and then that cow gave birth to a guar.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Same thing happened with the mouflon,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
where it's an endangered species of sheep.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It was gestated in a regular sheep body,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.
