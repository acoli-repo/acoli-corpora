00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
so that it was genetically engineered

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and transplanted onto a human being.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Genetic engineering

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
coupled with polymer physiotechnology

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
coupled with xenotransplantation.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
This is where we are in this process.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Finally, not that long ago,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
which is a machine,
