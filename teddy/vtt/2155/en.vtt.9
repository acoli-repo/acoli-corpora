00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and put it into mammal cells.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
These are normal cells.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And what you see here

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is these cells glowing in the dark

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
under certain wavelengths of light.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So they did it with mouse pups,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
kittens.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
while this is from jellyfish.
