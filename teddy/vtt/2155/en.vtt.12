Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.

There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that controls genetically-engineered pets.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so some states have decided to allow them,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Some of you may have read

of genetically-engineered salmon.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The salmon on top

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
using a gene from these salmon

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and from one other fish that we eat,
