00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in which we evolved.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We altered our ecological niche

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
by creating civilization.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And that has been the second great --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
flow of our evolution.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
By changing our environment,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we put new pressures

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
on our bodies to evolve.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all the way through modern medicine,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we have changed our own evolution.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now we're entering a third great wave
