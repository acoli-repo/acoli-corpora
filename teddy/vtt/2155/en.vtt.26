00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'll get back to that in a minute.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
There's also been work done with monkeys.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He took owl monkeys,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
wired them up

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
especially looking at the movement of their right arm.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The computer learned what the monkey brain did

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to move its arm in various ways.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
which you see here in the picture,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
put the arm in another room.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to make that arm in the other room
