00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is the largest cat in the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the lion-tiger hybrid.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's bigger than a tiger.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And in the case of the liger,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But these were created by scientists

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
using both selective breeding and genetic technology.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And then finally, everybody's favorite,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the zorse.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And so one of the things we've been doing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is using genetic enhancement,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or genetic manipulation,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of normal selective breeding
