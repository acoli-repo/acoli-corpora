00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
using a gene from these salmon

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and from one other fish that we eat,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to make it grow much faster

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
using a lot less feed.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
it'll be sold in the stores.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And before you get too worried about it,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
here in the United States,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
already has genetically-modified components to it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So even as we worry about it,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
without any regulation,
