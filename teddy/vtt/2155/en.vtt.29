WEBVTT

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
became an integrated chip.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And he used that

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
as the IT piece

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So now we have organic computer chips

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
took a completely intact,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
independent lamprey eel brain.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It is living --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with these electrodes going off to the sides,
