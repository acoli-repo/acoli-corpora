00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
while this is from jellyfish.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They did it with pigs.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They did it with puppies.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And, in fact,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they did it with monkeys.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And if you can do it with monkeys --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
is actually between monkeys and apes --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
if they can do it in monkeys,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which means they can do it in human beings.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In other words, it is theoretically possible

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable
