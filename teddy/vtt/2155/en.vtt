00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk about design,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but not design as we usually think about it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I want to talk about what is happening now

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in our scientific, biotechnological culture,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where, for really the first time in history,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we have the power to design bodies,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to design animal bodies,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to design human bodies.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In the history of our planet,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
there have been three great waves of evolution.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The first wave of evolution

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.
