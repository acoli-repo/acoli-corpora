00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or genetic manipulation,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of normal selective breeding

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
pushed a little bit through genetics.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And if that were all this was about,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
then it would be an interesting thing.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But something much, much more powerful

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is happening now.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
These are normal mammalian cells

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,
