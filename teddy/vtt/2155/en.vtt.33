00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
which is a machine,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
created an artificial genome,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
put it in a different cell --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
the genome was not of the cell he put it in --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and that cell then reproduced

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
as the other cell.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
In other words,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that was the first creature in the history of the world

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that had a computer as its parent --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it did not have an organic parent.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And so, asks The Economist:

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
"The first artificial organism and its consequences."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So you may have thought
