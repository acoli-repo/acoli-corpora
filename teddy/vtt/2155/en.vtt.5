00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
by choosing offspring that looked a particular way

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then breeding them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We don't have to do it that way anymore.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is a beefalo.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And they are now making them,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and someday, perhaps pretty soon,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you will have beefalo patties

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in your local supermarket.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This is a geep,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a goat-sheep hybrid.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The scientists that made this cute little creature
