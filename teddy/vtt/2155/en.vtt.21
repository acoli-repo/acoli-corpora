mitochondrial DNA.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in the age of biotechnology --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
a question that we're not really sure yet

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
how to solve.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This lovely creature

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
is an Asian cockroach.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And what they've done here

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and then a transmitter on top,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and it's on a big computer tracking ball.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And now, using a joystick,
