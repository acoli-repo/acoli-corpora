I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar,
who is a fellow poet.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.494
And Kaveh found this photo online

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:13.180
of the anatomical heart of a blue whale

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:17.014
that scientists had hung
on a hook from the ceiling,

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:20.557
which is how they were able to observe
that the heart of a blue whale

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.971
is big enough that a person
can stand up fully inside of it.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.407
