00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:10.425
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea,

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.705
through a series of channels
called bronchi,

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.050
and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.980
There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.410
adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square metersâ€”

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.440
the size of a tennis court.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.690
These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange:

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.730
allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream
