00:00:01.414 --> 00:00:05.877
I'm here to unveil a new
carbon-removal technology,

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:08.880
one out of sight and uncelebrated.

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.050
Meet our champion: seagrass.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.011
A very unlikely champion,

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:19.390
but yet a remarkable power
of carbon removal.

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:24.312
Seagrasses occupy
only 0.1 percent of the seafloor,

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:27.065
but they remove one-third
of all of the carbon

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:29.817
that gets sequestered
in the seafloor annually.
