This is a picture of Maurice Druon,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the French Academy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
befitting the role of the French Academy

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as legislating the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
correct usage in French

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and perpetuating the language.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The French Academy has two main tasks:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it compiles a dictionary of official French.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're now working on their ninth edition,
