which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.605
Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones,

while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles.

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:16.339
Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages,

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.104
we can stretch and contract those folds

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.644

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:26.483
This process is the same from
