00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.776
During puberty, 
the first major shift starts,

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:35.477
as your voice begins to deepen.

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.656
This happens when 
your larynx grows in size,

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:43.556
elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate.

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:47.437
These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations,

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.649
which result in a lower baseline pitch.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.307
This growth is especially dramatic
in many males,

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:57.053
whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks,

00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:00.167
and then to deeper, more booming voices,
