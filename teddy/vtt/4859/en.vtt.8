00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.220
But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.634
the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds.

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:13.324
The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices.

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:15.397
All these symptoms are further complicated

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:18.735
by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings,

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:23.996
which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:28.186
Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors

00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:30.072
that can affect your voice.
