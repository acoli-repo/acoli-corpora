00:00:54.734 --> 00:01:00.529
So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech?

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:05.586
The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.631
but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.227
and the size of our larynxes.

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:16.237
The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.865
that supports and moves the vocal cords,

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:22.814
or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds.

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:25.857
Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages,

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:31.636
these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea,
