00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:31.636
these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea,

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:34.575
the tube that carries 
air through the throat.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.804
The folds are apart when we’re breathing,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.136
but when we speak, they slam shut.

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:42.497
Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds,

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:46.481
blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.279
Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument,

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.561
we effortlessly change notes as we speak.

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.440
By pushing air faster or slower,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.919
we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations,

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:03.070
which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices.
