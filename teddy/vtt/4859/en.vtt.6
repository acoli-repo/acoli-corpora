00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:00.167
and then to deeper, more booming voices,

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.258
and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples.

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:06.793
Another vocal development during puberty

00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:09.714
occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:13.625
specializes into three distinct 
functional layers:

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.121
a central muscle,

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:19.713
a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers,

00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:23.143
and an outer layer of mucus membrane.

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:25.924
These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice,

00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:30.763
giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones.
