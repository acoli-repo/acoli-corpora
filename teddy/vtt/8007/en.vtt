00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:10.631
How do you know you’re a person 
who has lived your life,

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:15.178
rather than a just-formed brain
full of artificial memories,

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:20.224
momentarily hallucinating a reality
that doesn't actually exist?

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.769
That may sound absurd,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.231
but it’s kept several generations 
of top cosmologists up at night.

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.693
They call it the Boltzmann brain paradox.
