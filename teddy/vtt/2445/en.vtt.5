00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:30.934
This active bystanding
had an almost immediate positive effect.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958
Starbucks closed a number of its doors
and implemented bias training.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.418
Most of us think that we would be
these active bystanders.

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.042
That we would be these kinds of heroes.

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.117
In fact, in research on this,

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:47.220
when researchers give people
hypothetical scenarios

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:48.791
and ask if they would intervene,

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:52.018
most of us say, "Yes, of course,
of course I would stand up."

00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:54.994
But even when those same researchers

00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:59.709
present an actual physical situation
where someone needs to actually intervene,

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.598
most people do nothing.
