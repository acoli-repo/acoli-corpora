00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:02.198
I'm Dr. Julia Shaw,

00:00:02.222 --> 00:00:05.024
a research associate
at University College London,

00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:06.960
and the cofounder of Spot.

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:11.133
Spot is a tool that helps organizations
tackle harassment and discrimination

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:14.442
with better reporting options
and better training.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.006
And in 2019,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.283
along with Dr. Camilla Elphick
and Dr. Rashid Minhas,

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:23.006
and a number of international
NGOs and charities,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.776
we conducted one
of the largest studies ever

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.257
on witnesses of harassment
and discrimination at work.
