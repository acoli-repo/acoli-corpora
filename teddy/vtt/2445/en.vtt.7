00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.943
The number one barrier
was actually the exact same

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:34.395
as the main barrier that victims report,

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.500
which is the fear
of consequences or retaliation.

00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:40.921
Even witnesses are worried
about what might happen

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:43.055
to them and their careers.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.770
Other reasons that people reported

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:49.140
was not wanting to interfere
or not wanting to be a snitch,

00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:52.338
not knowing they could report,
or not knowing how.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.156
All of these things can be targeted

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.259
with better education
and better systems in workplaces.

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.220
But the story of the witness
isn't complete
