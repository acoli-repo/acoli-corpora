00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:00.315
I found myself with reporting paralysis.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.149
I didn't speak up

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:04.243

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.586
Why didn't I just speak up?

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:27.276
we've seen that reporting paralysis

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.003
and some people
are able to now have voices
