When we asked our participants
about reporting,

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:36.958
and when we asked them
about the negative consequences for them,

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.315
we found that most people said,
when asked directly,

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.268
"Did witnessing this experience
have a negative repercussion?"

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:45.299
Most people said, "No, I'm fine."

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.990
But when we looked
at the qualitative entries,

00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:52.585
when we looked at what people
actually wrote about this experience,

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:56.212
we found that these experiences
had profoundly negative impacts.

00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:58.528
They increased stress
and anxiety and depression,

00:04:58.552 --> 00:05:01.744
they increased the prevalence
of desire to leave the organization,
