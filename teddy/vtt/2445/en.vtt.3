00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.003
and some people
are able to now have voices

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:31.967
who before were voiceless.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.924
When we first started Spot,

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:35.762
we allowed people to submit statements

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.086
about experiencing harassment
or discrimination

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.983
to talktospot.com.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.474
And as researchers,
we looked at these stories,

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.688
and we were shocked when we found

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:50.782
that 93 percent of victims reported
that there was at least one witness.

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:54.716
These things aren't happening
behind closed doors.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.494
Further research has since come out

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:58.280
which has further repeated this idea

00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:01.905
that most harassment
and discrimination is witnessed.
