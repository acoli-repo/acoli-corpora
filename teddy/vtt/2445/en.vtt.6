00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.598
most people do nothing.

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:04.615
And they fall prey
to the well-known bystander effect.

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:06.662
Why?

00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:09.774
And what are the barriers
that people are facing?

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:11.900
In our research,

three quarters of people
who we had interviewed

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.887

which was over 1,000 participants --

to someone who could do
something about it.

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:29.204
And the barriers that they cited?

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.943
The number one barrier
was actually the exact same
