The main person who's likely to harass
someone in your organization

00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:02.307
is a manager.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.292
Now, why?

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:06.202
Perhaps because power corrupts,

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:09.780
or perhaps because we promote people
into managerial roles

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.728
because they're excellent at their jobs,

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:14.347
and we assume that they will pick up
the people skills,

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:16.672
pick up the management
skills along the way.

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.030
But then they don't.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:22.514
And this provides a fertile ground
for harassment and discrimination

00:07:22.538 --> 00:07:24.364
with unrealistic expectations,

00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:25.871
with poor time management,

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.361
with poor conflict management skills.

00:07:28.932 --> 00:07:30.265
Train your managers.
