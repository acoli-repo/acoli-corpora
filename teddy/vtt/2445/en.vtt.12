your ability as an organization

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.315
to retain and attract
diverse and excellent candidates.

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:09.104
So what do we do to stop
this social contagion?

00:06:09.128 --> 00:06:11.117
What do we do to reduce these barriers

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:14.086
and how do we provide support
for witnesses and victims?

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:17.361
How can we be better allies?

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:20.132
And it's easier than you might think.

00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:26.290
that I think every organization
can and should do

00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:27.831
to help tackle this issue

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:30.122
and to build healthier workplaces.
