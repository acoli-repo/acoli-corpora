00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.220
But the story of the witness
isn't complete

00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:03.291
without also talking
about the consequences

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:05.045
for the witnesses themselves.

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:08.826
If you were to see someone
who just witnessed a crime

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.537
being committed on the street,

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.815
you would almost certainly
go up to that witness

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.117
and say, "Are you OK?

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.418
Do you need some support?"

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.934
You might even offer them
counseling or therapy

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958
to process what they just saw.

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.278
But witnesses at work
are largely invisible.

00:04:23.302 --> 00:04:25.835
And of course, so is support for them.

00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:29.682
And some of this invisibility
might even be internalized.
