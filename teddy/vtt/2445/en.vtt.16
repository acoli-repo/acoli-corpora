00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.111
Perhaps shockingly,

00:08:01.135 --> 00:08:03.238
although managers
are the most likely person

00:08:03.262 --> 00:08:05.524
to be perpetrating harassment
or discrimination,

00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:06.856
in many organizations

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.483
they're also supposed to be
your first point of contact

00:08:09.507 --> 00:08:10.736
when things go wrong.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.474
Now that's a major sticking point.

00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:14.822
So being able to choose
who you go to is crucial.

00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:16.854
Third, encouraging witness reporting.

00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:19.672
Back to setting a tone
in your organization,

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:21.728
saying you can and should report things,

00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:23.941
and you can help stand up for each other.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:27.847
Fourth, even when you have
all of this in place,

00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:29.990
most people will not speak to HR.
