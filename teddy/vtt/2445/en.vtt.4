that most harassment
and discrimination is witnessed.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.729
And so how do we mobilize these witnesses?

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.128
First, let's talk about the psychology
of being a witness.

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:12.029
In 2018, two women were at a Starbucks

00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:15.164
when they watched a barista
deny access to a washroom

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:17.055
to two African American men.

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:20.082
Instead, the barista called the police.

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:24.159
The two active bystanders
took a video of the men in handcuffs

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:25.583
and posted it online.

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:30.934
This active bystanding
had an almost immediate positive effect.
