00:08:30.014 --> 00:08:31.459
We know this, because at Spot,

00:08:31.483 --> 00:08:33.490
we though anonymity
would solve everything.

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:34.672
It did not.

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.474

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.897
Because just like in our survey,

00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.343
if you ask people directly

00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:00.396
if they have experienced
harassment or discrimination,
