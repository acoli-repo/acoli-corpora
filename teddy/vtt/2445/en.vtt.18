00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:00.396
if they have experienced
harassment or discrimination,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.197
the default answer is no.

00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.743
But if you ask about specific experiences
or specific behaviors,

00:09:05.767 --> 00:09:08.696

is to build a shared social identity.

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:23.168

00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:29.693
We are in this together.

00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:31.319
