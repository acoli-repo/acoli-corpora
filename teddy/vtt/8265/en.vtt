Fifteen years ago,

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:07.795
I walked into a classroom
as a first-year preschool teacher.

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:10.339
Ambitious and eager to impress,

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.800
I created this Excel document

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:17.263
to track the things I thought
mattered most for my students:

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.100
letters, numbers, shapes and colors.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.562
Looking back, though,
with what I know now,

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:28.566
I wish I wouldn't have bothered
with Excel or rote memorization.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.031
I wish instead I had leveraged the power
of brain-building interactive play.
