And finally, remember --

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:07.897
the entire industry
is dependent for its income

00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:10.191
on one thing and one thing only: markups.

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:14.753
And ultimately, you have
to be sustainable.

00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:17.112
If you spend a lot of money
on helping poor people

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.750
and you don't get paid for it,
and you lose this money;

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:23.885

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.713
So for these reasons,

to expect that pharmaceutical companies
will solve the problem
