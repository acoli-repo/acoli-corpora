The Health Impact Fund is basically
opening up the second track

00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:05.057
with which pharmaceutical innovators
can be rewarded for their activities.

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:06.247
They have a choice.

00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.942
They can either go with the old system,
with patent-protected markups,

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.355
or they can go with the new system,

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:16.077
being rewarded on the basis
of the health impact

00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:18.203
of the medicines that they develop.

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.691
And with each particular medicine,
they have their choice.

00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:24.762
So they can be partly on one track,
partly on the other,

00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:26.248
with different products.

00:09:26.272 --> 00:09:28.965
Now, how would
the Health Impact Fund work?
