00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:32.019
where brand-name companies pay generic
companies to delay entry, for example.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:35.938
A lot of money goes to take our patents
in all the different jurisdictions.

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:38.532
Money goes – even larger
amounts – for litigation.

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.108
They're litigating endlessly --

00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:42.306
brand-name company
against brand-name company,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.631
brand-name company
against generic company ...

00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:46.044
Enormous amounts go there.

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:49.137
People say pharmaceutical companies
make a lot of profit.

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:54.046
Well, yes and no; they do, but a lot of it
goes to these wasteful activities.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.817
Deadweight losses -- I won't
even tell you what they are,

00:04:56.841 --> 00:04:58.268
because it's too complicated.

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.899
But there's also wasteful marketing.
