00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:31.716
hospitalization, operations,
emergency rooms, the morgue ...

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.837
None of these are good things.

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.452
So we should be very grateful
that we have pharmacologists around,

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.393
people who research these things
and develop new medicines.

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:44.776
And we should be grateful
that we have a pharmaceutical industry

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.891
that supports their activities.

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:50.634
But there is a problem,
and you can tell from the fact

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.108
that the pharmaceutical
industry isn't well-loved.

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:58.092
In fact, in terms of popularity, they rank
just about with the tobacco companies

00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.856
and the arms manufacturers.
