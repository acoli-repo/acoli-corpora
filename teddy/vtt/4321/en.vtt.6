00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:02.114
And vice versa -- ninety percent
of the money is spent on diseases

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:05.777
that account for only ten percent
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.498
So there's a huge mismatch between
where we spend the research money

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:13.159
and where the greatest problems are.

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:15.174
Now, both these problems --

00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:17.943
the problem with innovation
and the problem with access --

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.382
have to do with this:

00:03:20.118 --> 00:03:22.041
the distribution of money in the world.

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:23.358
It's extremely unequal.

00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:27.721
The blue area here is the top quarter
of the human population.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.838
They have more than ninety percent
of the global household income.
