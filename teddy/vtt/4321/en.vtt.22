00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:02.022
but rather, our preferred way
of determining what the real cost is

00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:04.803
of making a medicine, of manufacturing it,

00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:08.460
is to ask the registrant to put
the production of the medicine

00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:13.678
out for tender, let generic companies
compete for the production,

00:11:13.702 --> 00:11:17.646
and then the innovator would buy
the product from the cheapest supplier

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.047
and would sell it at that same
lowest possible price to patients.

00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:28.750
So the innovator would make no money
at all on selling the product,

00:11:28.774 --> 00:11:33.115
but would make all its money
from the health impact rewards.
