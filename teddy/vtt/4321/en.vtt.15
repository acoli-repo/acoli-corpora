00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.228
to expect that pharmaceutical companies
will solve the problem

00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:31.884
on moral grounds.

00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:33.689
Who, then, should solve the problem?

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:35.158
I suggest it has to be us.

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:39.417
We, citizens and politicians,
have to do better

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.564
in terms of regulating
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.220
focusing them,
giving them the right incentives,

00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:47.986
focusing them on the problems
that really matter.

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:52.478
The potential gains here are enormous.

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:57.058
About one third of all deaths
each day, each year,

00:07:57.082 --> 00:08:00.494
are due to the diseases of poverty
in the developing world.
