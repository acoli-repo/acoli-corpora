00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:00.436
In other cases, the new product
is better than the old products,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.588
and so a person gets switched over
to a better product,

00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:07.939
and we pay for the impact,
for the difference the new product makes.

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:11.036
If you have a product
on the Health Impact Fund

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.750
and you simply switch somebody
from an existing product

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.620
to another product, to your product,
and it's no better,

00:12:16.644 --> 00:12:17.800
you get no money.

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:20.756
That's in stark contrast
to the existing system,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.141
where you get a lot of money
for switching somebody from one product

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:26.927
to an equal product that is your product.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.086
The Health Impact Fund
does not pay for that.
