00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:33.494
and then try to figure out
what the health impact of the medicine is

00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:36.561
in different locations,
in different demographic groups ...

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:39.609
And, of course, you look very carefully
at the actual world --

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:44.203
this is in contrast to how medicines
are today rewarded.

00:13:44.227 --> 00:13:46.903
Sometimes, there is a reward
based on performance,

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:51.461
but it's the performance in clinical
trials, in the laboratory, if you like,

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:54.477
and not the performance in the real world.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:58.514
The Health Impact Fund
would look at real-world impact.

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.720
It would look not just
at the quality of a drug,
