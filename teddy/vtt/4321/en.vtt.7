00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.838
They have more than ninety percent
of the global household income.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.876
The bottom half of humanity,
on the other hand,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.199
has not even three percent
of global household income.

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:42.658
So if you're a pharmaceutical company
and you look for profit opportunities,

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:45.628
you look at this sort of chart and say,
"Where's the money?

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:47.235
What am I going to research?

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.649
Who am I going to provide with medicines?"

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:54.734
And again, that is in the context
of there being only one way

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:58.183
in which pharmaceutical companies
make money under the present system,

00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.379
that is, through patent-protected markups.
