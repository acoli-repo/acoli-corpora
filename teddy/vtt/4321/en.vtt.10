00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.899
But there's also wasteful marketing.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:04.176
A lot of the money
that pharmaceutical companies make

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.972
goes into advertising campaigns,

00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:07.749
trying to win favor with doctors,

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.418
trying to persuade patients
to try this medicine.

00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:13.623
And these marketing battles,
of course, are a pure waste,

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.932
because what one company spends
to get patients over to their drug,

00:05:16.956 --> 00:05:18.938
another company spends to win them back.

00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:22.222
And then there is counterfeiting
in the developing countries.

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:25.627
A lot of the drugs there, often more than
fifty percent of what's sold,

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.619
are counterfeit drugs, where people say,

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:31.038
"Because the drug is so expensive,
I can offer you a cheaper version."
