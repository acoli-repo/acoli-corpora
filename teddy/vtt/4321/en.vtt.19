00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:32.273
There would be a fixed
reward pool every year.

00:09:32.297 --> 00:09:34.297
We start with maybe six billion dollars,

00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.116
but that can eventually be revved up.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.783
Remember that the total money
that the world spends on pharmaceuticals

00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:40.965
is a trillion.

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:44.039
So it's a thousand billion;
six billion is a drop in the bucket.

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:46.804
It's relatively small,
but it would work with six billion,

00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:50.592
and we'd get a lot of bang for the buck
if we introduced the Health Impact Fund

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:52.254
with just six billion dollars.

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:56.442
If you have a product
and you want to register it

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:58.178
with the Health Impact Fund,

00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:01.593
you will be rewarded
for a period of 10 years.
