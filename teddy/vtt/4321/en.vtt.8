00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.379
that is, through patent-protected markups.

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.822
That's how they make their money,
through markups.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:04.889
And if you make money through markups,

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:09.740
then obviously, you will go to where
the people have the most income.

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:12.974
Now in terms of overall efficiency,

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:15.951
the system also does very, very poorly.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:19.144
A lot of money goes
for lobbying politicians

00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:22.901
in order to extend patent periods --
to "evergreen," as it's called.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.613
Data exclusivity and so on.

00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:26.147
A lot of money goes for gaming,

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:32.019
where brand-name companies pay generic
companies to delay entry, for example.
