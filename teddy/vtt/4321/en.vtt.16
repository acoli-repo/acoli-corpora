00:07:57.082 --> 00:08:00.494
are due to the diseases of poverty
in the developing world.

00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:06.542
Fifty thousand people every day
die prematurely from these diseases.

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:09.691
And that's not even counting
all the diseases

00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:12.237
that we know only too well
in the rich countries:

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.179
cancer, heart disease and so on.

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.826
Again, poor people die often much earlier,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.650
because they don't have good medical care,
including good medicines.

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:26.074
And even in rich countries, many patients
are not getting the best medicine.

00:08:26.098 --> 00:08:29.576
That's sometimes due to the fact
that insurance companies won't cover it,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.296
because the price
is so absolutely ridiculous.
