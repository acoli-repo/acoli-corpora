00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:34.774
One is that pharmaceutical companies
are bound to their shareholders.

00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:38.669
The executive of such a company
wouldn't last very long

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:42.957
if he gave a lot of money away,
or she, for good purposes,

00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:46.893
and thereby lost money
for the shareholders.

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:48.225
They would be replaced.

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:52.718
Also, pharmaceutical companies stand
in fierce competition with one another,

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:56.107
and if you do more, if you are nicer
than the other company,

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:58.675
sooner or later, you'll be
driven out of the market.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:59.858
You will not survive.

00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:02.095
The other company will gain market share.
