I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.

00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:05.834
First, universal access: forget about it.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.532
The vast majority of human beings
do not have access to medicines,

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:12.909
at least while they're still under patent.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.925
There are extremely high markups,
and that's the problem.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.878
The problem is that even though
these medicines are very cheap to produce,

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:26.267
they cost a great amount of money
during the time that they're under patent,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.004
and the reason for that is
that rich people can pay a lot of money.
