00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.720
It would look not just
at the quality of a drug,

00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:05.315
but also at how widely it is distributed,

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:08.690
whether the innovator manages
to target those patients

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:10.974
who can benefit the most,

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:14.610
and also, how well the drug
is used in the field.

00:14:14.634 --> 00:14:18.787
So innovators would have much
stronger incentives than they do now

00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:21.278
to make sure that every patient
who takes the drug

00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:24.293
knows exactly how to take it
to optimal effect.

00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:29.021
Today, most packaged inserts are not even
translated into local languages,

00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:33.936
and so it's not surprising that patients
don't make the best use of the product.
