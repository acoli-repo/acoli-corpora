00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.001
I hope you're all healthy,

00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:07.202
and I hope we will all remain healthy
for the indefinite future.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.570
But that hope is a little bit unrealistic,

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:12.560
and so I've got a second back-up hope.

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:16.722
The second back-up hope is that,
insofar as we have health problems,

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:20.081
we will have good medicines
to take care of them.

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.473
Medicines are very cheap to produce
and they're very effective --

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:27.640
much more pleasant, actually,
than the alternatives:

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:31.716
hospitalization, operations,
emergency rooms, the morgue ...
