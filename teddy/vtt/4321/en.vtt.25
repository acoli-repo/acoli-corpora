00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.086
The Health Impact Fund
does not pay for that.

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:35.071
We quantify health impact in terms
of quality-adjusted life years.

00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:37.554
That method has been around
for about 20 years,

00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:39.106
and it's very easy to explain.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.751
Just think of a human life
as a kind of plank.

00:12:41.775 --> 00:12:44.506
It's eighty inches long, one inch high.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.002
And when you die prematurely
before you reach 80,

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:48.962
well, the plank is a little shorter.

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:52.088
And if you're sick during
the time that you live,

00:12:52.112 --> 00:12:53.922
the plank is a little bit thinner.

00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:58.388
And what diseases can nibble away,
medicines can restore,

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:02.663
or medicines can avert
the taking away of these parts.
