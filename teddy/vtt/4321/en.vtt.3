00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.989
Secondly, we want innovative activities,

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:34.845
the research and development
that pharmaceutical companies do,

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.547
to track the diseases that are
the most important, the most damaging.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:41.642
We want them to aim
for the greatest health impact.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:45.546
And thirdly, we want
the whole system to be efficient.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.398
We want as little of the money
that goes into the system to go to waste,

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:53.928
to go for overhead,
for red tape, and so on and so forth.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.422
Very simple three points.

00:01:57.636 --> 00:01:59.596
Now what about the existing system?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.219
I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.
