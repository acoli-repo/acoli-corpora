00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:31.038
"Because the drug is so expensive,
I can offer you a cheaper version."

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:32.958
But of course it's not the real thing,

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:35.548
it's either diluted
or it's completely inert.

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:39.250
So on the whole, all the money
that is spent on pharmaceuticals --

00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:42.586
and it's roughly a trillion dollars
now, per annum --

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.597
much of that money
is absolutely going to waste,

00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:47.716
it's not going to where
it should be going,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.066
namely, to the development
of new medicines

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.114
and to the manufacturing
of ones that we already have.

00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.634
Now, many people think
that the solution to the problem

00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:59.592
is moral pressure
on pharmaceutical companies.
