00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.602
I coined my own definition
of success in 1934,

00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:07.563
when I was teaching at a high school
in South Bend, Indiana,

00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:12.347
being a little bit disappointed,
and [disillusioned] perhaps,

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:16.418
by the way parents of the youngsters
in my English classes

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.291
expected their youngsters
to get an A or a B.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:23.212
They thought a C was all right
for the neighbors' children,

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.203
because they were all average.

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:27.362
But they weren't satisfied
when their own --

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:31.354
it would make the teacher feel that they
had failed, or the youngster had failed.
