00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:30.194
from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:34.679
is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:37.629
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.604
which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.

00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:46.210
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.920
by feeding them cocaine

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.892
after getting the appropriate DEA license

00:10:50.892 --> 00:10:54.892
— oh my God -- (Laughter) —

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:58.064
we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies

00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:01.106
calm down faster than normal flies do,
