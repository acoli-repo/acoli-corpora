00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:01.106
calm down faster than normal flies do,

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:04.305
and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,

00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:06.350
which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.369
that act similarly to cocaine.

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:12.518
So slowly I began to realize that what started out

00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:16.167
as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:20.143
might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.

00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:22.369
Now, how far does this analogy go?

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.491
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD

00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:27.828
also have learning disabilities.

00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:31.394
Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?
