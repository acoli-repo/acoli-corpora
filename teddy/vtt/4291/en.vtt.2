In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.824
you go to your doctor, and what do you get?

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.811
A questionnaire.

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.240
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.063
an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:16.950
of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.193
We tend to view them --

00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:21.038
and the popular press aids and abets this view --

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:24.054
as chemical imbalances in the brain,

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.738
as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:31.938
full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
