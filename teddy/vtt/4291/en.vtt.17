00:08:29.928 --> 00:08:33.152
upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,

00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:37.466
the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:40.064
which is persistent, long-lasting,

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:42.568
and also appears to be graded.

00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:45.427
More puffs, or more intense puffs,

00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:49.340
make the state last for a longer period of time.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.376
So now we wanted to try to understand something

00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:55.090
about what controls the duration of this state.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.941
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat

00:08:57.941 --> 00:08:59.996
and our automated tracking software

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:03.778
to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies
