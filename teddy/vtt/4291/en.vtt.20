00:09:57.268 --> 00:10:00.681
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked

00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.781
to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:08.015
Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:10.805
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.

00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:14.065
We tend to infer the normal function of something

00:10:14.065 --> 00:10:17.775
by what doesn't happen when we take it away,

00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:20.778
by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:23.791
So when we take away the dopamine receptor

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.348
and the flies take longer to calm down,

00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:30.194
from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine
