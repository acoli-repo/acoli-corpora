00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.328
in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:04.412
And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:08.678
of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.

00:13:08.678 --> 00:13:11.140
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.704
and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor

00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:18.939
by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:20.990
back into the fly brain.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.825
But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:28.539
and not in others, and then we test each of these flies

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:32.207
for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
