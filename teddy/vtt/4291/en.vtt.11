here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism

00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:35.391
to study the connection between genes and behavior.

Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:43.432
He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,

00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:45.820
and Seymour taught me both to love flies

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.869
and also to play with science.

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:51.985
So how do we ask this question?

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:56.045
It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:59.208
but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.158
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,
