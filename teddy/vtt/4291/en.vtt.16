00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:02.665
And what we found is that if we gave these flies

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:05.513
in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,

00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:08.202
they became somewhat hyperactive

00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:12.637
and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped

00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:15.501
and took a while to calm down.

00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.690
So we quantified this behavior

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.702
using custom locomotor tracking software

00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:23.502
developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.114
who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:29.928
And what this quantification showed us is that,

00:08:29.928 --> 00:08:33.152
upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,
