Now to begin to overcome our ignorance

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:36.136
of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:38.816
it's helpful to work on what we biologists call

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.395
"model organisms,"

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:43.729
animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.154
in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:50.779
to molecularly identify and pinpoint

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.342
specific classes of neurons,

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:55.245
as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.706
Moreover, once we can do that,

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:00.455
we can actually activate specific neurons
