Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:07.063
as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:10.783
However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.

00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:14.096
(Laughter)

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:17.233
It's kind of like landing on Mars

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:19.938
and looking out the window of your spaceship

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:22.408
at all the little green men who are surrounding it

00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:24.814
and trying to figure out, "How do I find out

00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:27.169
if they have emotions or not?"

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.712
What can we do? It's not so easy.
