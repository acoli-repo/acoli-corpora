Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,

00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:04.462
they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:08.273
They flunk out of CalTech.

00:12:08.273 --> 00:12:13.021
So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,

00:12:13.021 --> 00:12:16.071
or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:21.583
that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:25.946
Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:29.859
In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity

00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:31.765
causes the learning disability.
