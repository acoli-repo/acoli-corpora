00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.109
emotion, mood and affect.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.871
When we think about cognition,

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.447
we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:38.028
Well it turns out that the computer analogy

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.411
is just as valid for emotion.

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.197
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:46.480
But we know much less about the circuit basis

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.379
of psychiatric disorders

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.449
because of the overwhelming dominance

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.801
of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:57.628
Now, it's not that chemicals are not important

00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:59.165
in psychiatric disorders.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.137
It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.
