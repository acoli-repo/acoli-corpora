00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:03.778
to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:08.857
to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.

00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:11.204
And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:13.997
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone

00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:17.638
and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants

00:09:17.638 --> 00:09:19.810
and screen them in your assay and then find out

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.129
what gene is affected in the mutation.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.641
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:30.115
that took much longer than normal to calm down
