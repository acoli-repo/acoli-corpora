00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:31.765
causes the learning disability.

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:35.484
The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.

00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:38.780
But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.652
that cause the hyperactivity.

00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:45.122
Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.

00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:48.179
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:50.583
between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:55.498
but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.

00:12:55.498 --> 00:12:57.840
Now people have been wondering about this for a long time

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.328
in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.
