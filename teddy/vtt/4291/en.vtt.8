00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:00.455
we can actually activate specific neurons

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:04.666
or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.380
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.845
and we find that a behavior is blocked,

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:12.059
we can conclude that those neurons

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.023
are necessary for that behavior.

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:17.405
On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.219
and we find that that produces the behavior,

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.293
we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:27.302
So in this way, by doing this kind of test,

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.825
we can draw cause and effect relationships
