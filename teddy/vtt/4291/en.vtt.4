00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.994
is a bit like trying to change your engine oil

00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:10.107
by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:12.257
Some of it will dribble into the right place,

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.358
but a lot of it will do more harm than good.

00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.596
Now, an emerging view

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:20.546
that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:23.116
is that psychiatric disorders are actually

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:26.590
disturbances of neural circuits that mediate

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.109
emotion, mood and affect.
