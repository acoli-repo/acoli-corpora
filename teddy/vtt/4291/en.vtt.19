00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:30.115
that took much longer than normal to calm down

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:32.392
after the air puffs,

00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:36.342
and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.947
it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:42.958
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.730
and it acts on their brains and on their synapses

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.280
through the same dopamine receptor molecules

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.669
that you and I have.

00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:54.155
Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:57.268
including in attention, arousal, reward,

00:09:57.268 --> 00:10:00.681
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
