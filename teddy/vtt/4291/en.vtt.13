00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.712
What can we do? It's not so easy.

00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:32.897
Well, one of the ways that we can start

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:37.022
is to try to come up with some general characteristics

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.770
or properties of emotion-like states

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.234
such as arousal, and see if we can identify

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:49.610
any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.430
So three important ones that I can think of

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.102
are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.

00:06:57.102 --> 00:06:59.436
Persistence means long-lasting.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.397
We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion
