00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.825
we can draw cause and effect relationships

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.181
between the activity of specific neurons

00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:36.094
in particular circuits and particular behaviors,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:38.531
something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,

00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:43.582
to do right now in humans.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:46.419
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.619
it's a great model organism

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.157
because it's got a small brain,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:54.944
it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.094
it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.

00:04:58.094 --> 00:04:59.889
But can an organism like this

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.732
teach us anything about emotion-like states?
