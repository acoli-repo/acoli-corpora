It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:06.786
Rather, they're released in very specific locations

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.511
and they act on specific synapses

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:13.199
to change the flow of information in the brain.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.636
So if we ever really want to understand

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:18.341
the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.373
we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.107
where these chemicals act.

00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:26.586
Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.543
and suffering the consequences.

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.602
Now to begin to overcome our ignorance
