00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:07.496
I want to find aliens.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:11.038
Finding life on another planet
is not just going to be a little hard,

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.746
it's going to be very hard.

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:15.079
But for the first time in human history,

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.413
we have a chance to detect
signs of life on another planet.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.371
Or maybe we've already
detected it on Venus.

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.163
Or maybe not.

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.704
There are still two big hurdles

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.538
when it comes to confirming life
on another world.

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:30.913
The first is building a telescope
big enough to do this,
