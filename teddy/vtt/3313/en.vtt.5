00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.684
You look down to get
your footing but it's blurry.

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.101
Why would it be blurry?

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.559
Well, you look down
and that's the near part of the lens,

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.143
but the next step was past arm's reach,

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.268
which for your eyes counts as far.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:44.184
The next solution I want to point out
is a little less common

00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.601
but comes up in contact lenses
or LASIK surgeries,

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:47.976
and it's called monovision.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.518
It works by setting up
the dominant eye to focus far

00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:52.143
and the other eye to focus near.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.976
Your brain does the work
of intelligently putting together

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.976
the sharpest parts from each eye's view,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.268
but the two eyes see
slightly different things,

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.934
and that makes it harder
to judge distances binocularly.
