WEBVTT

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.601
and reports distances to objects.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.601
We can again use your gaze direction
to get a distance estimate

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.893
for a second time.

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.893
We then fuse those two distance estimates

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:10.393
and update the focus-tunable
lens power accordingly.

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:13.351
The next step for us was
to test our device on actual people.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.518
So we recruited about 100 presbyopes
and had them test our device

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:18.351
while we measured their performance.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.643
What we saw convinced us right then
that autofocals were the future.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:25.018
Our participants could see more clearly,
they could focus more quickly

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:28.059
and they thought it was an easier
and better focusing experience

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:29.559
than their current correction.

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.643
To put it simply, when it comes to vision,
