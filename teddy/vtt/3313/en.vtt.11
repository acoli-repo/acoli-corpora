To put it simply, when it comes to vision,

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.893
autofocals don't compromise
like static corrections in use today do.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.851
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.601
There's a lot of work
for my colleagues and me left to do.

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.893
For example, our glasses are a bit --

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:42.934
(Laughter)

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.309
bulky, maybe?

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:47.684
And one reason for this
is that we used bulkier components

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:50.518
that are often intended
for research use or industrial use.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:52.809
Another is that we need
to strap everything down

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:56.643
because current eye-tracking algorithms
don't have the robustness that we need.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:57.976
So moving forward,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.476
as we move from a research
setting into a start-up,
