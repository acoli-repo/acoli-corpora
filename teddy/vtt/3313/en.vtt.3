I want to remind you that presbyopia
has been with us for all of human history

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.768
and we've done a lot
of different things to try and fix it.

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:38.684
So to start, let's imagine
that you're sitting at a desk, reading.

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.059
If you were presbyopic,

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:42.143
it might look a little
something like this.

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:45.059
Anything close by,
like the magazine, will be blurry.

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.434
Moving on to solutions.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.101
First, reading glasses.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.184
These have lenses
with a single focal power

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:52.601
tuned so that near objects
come into focus.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.226
But far objects
necessarily go out of focus,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.726
meaning you have to constantly
switch back and forth

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.518
between wearing and not wearing them.

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:00.809
To solve this problem
