00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.268
and when you look near,

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:33.726
near objects come into focus
in your field of view,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.601
without you having to think about it.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.143
What I've worked on
these last few years at Stanford

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.768
is building that exact intelligence
around the lenses.

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:44.393
Our prototype borrows technology
from virtual and augmented reality systems

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.934
to estimate focusing distance.

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.601
We have an eye tracker that can tell
what direction our eyes are focused in.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.434
Using two of these, we can
triangulate your gaze direction

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.768
to get a focus estimate.

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.976
Just in case though,
to increase reliability,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.559
we also added a distance sensor.

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:59.976
The sensor is a camera
that looks out at the world

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.601
and reports distances to objects.
