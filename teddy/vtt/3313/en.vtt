00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:02.809
Every single one of us will lose

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.684
or has already lost something
we rely on every single day.

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:09.518
I am of course talking about our keys.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.184
(Laughter)

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.476
Just kidding.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.309
What I actually want to talk about is one
of our most important senses: vision.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.143
Every single day we each lose
a little bit of our ability

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.476
to refocus our eyes

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.809
until we can't refocus at all.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.809
We call this condition presbyopia,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.351
and it affects two billion
people worldwide.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.518
That's right, I said billion.

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.268
If you haven't heard of presbyopia,
