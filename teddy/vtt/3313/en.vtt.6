00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.934
and that makes it harder
to judge distances binocularly.

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.351
So where does that leave us?

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.226
We've come up with a lot of solutions

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.851
but none of them quite restore
natural refocusing.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:09.934
None of them let you
just look at something

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.434
and expect it to be in focus.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.809
But why?

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:14.101
Well, to explain that

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.851
we'll want to take a look
at the anatomy of the human eye.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:20.101
The part of the eye that allows us
to refocus to different distances

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.684
is called the crystalline lens.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.559
There are muscles surrounding the lens
that can deform it into different shapes,

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:27.684
which in turn changes its focusing power.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.184
What happens when someone
becomes presbyopic?
