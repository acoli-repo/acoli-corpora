What happens when someone
becomes presbyopic?

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.434
It turns out that
the crystalline lens stiffens

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:35.143
to the point that it doesn't
really change shape anymore.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:38.893
Now, thinking back
on all the solutions I listed earlier,

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:42.643
we can see that they all have
something in common with the others

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.143
but not with our eyes,

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.184
and that is that they're all static.

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:49.101
It's like the optical equivalent
of a pirate with a peg leg.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:52.268
What is the optical equivalent
of a modern prosthetic leg?

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:55.559
The last several decades have seen
the creation and rapid development

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:58.268
of what are called "focus-tunable lenses."

00:03:58.292 --> 00:03:59.976
There are several different types.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.809
Mechanically-shifted Alvarez lenses,
