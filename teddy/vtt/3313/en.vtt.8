00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.809
Mechanically-shifted Alvarez lenses,

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.268
deformable liquid lenses

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:05.851
and electronically-switched,
liquid crystal lenses.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.684
Now these have their own trade-offs,

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.309
but what they don't skimp on
is the visual experience.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.601
Full-field-of-view vision that can be
sharp at any desired distance.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.768
OK, great. The lenses we need
already exist.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:17.684
Problem solved, right?

00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:19.143
Not so fast.

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:22.143
Focus-tunable lenses add a bit
of complexity to the equation.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.018
The lenses don't have any way of knowing
what distance they should be focused to.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.351
What we need are glasses

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:29.934
that, when you're looking far,
far objects are sharp,

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.268
and when you look near,
