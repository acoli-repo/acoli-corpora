00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.476
as we move from a research
setting into a start-up,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.434
we plan to make future autofocals

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:05.018
eventually look a little bit more
like normal glasses.

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:08.393
For this to happen,
we'll need to significantly improve

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.559
the robustness
of our eye-tracking solution.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.768
We'll also need to incorporate smaller
and more efficient electronics and lenses.

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.976
That said, even with
our current prototype,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.726
we've shown that today's
focus-tunable lens technology

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.309
is capable of outperforming
traditional forms of static correction.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.976
So it's only a matter of time.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.059
It's pretty clear that in the near future,

00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:30.143
instead of worrying about which pair
of glasses to use and when,
