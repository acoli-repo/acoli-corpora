00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.351
the closest you can focus
is about 25 centimeters,

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:01.643
maybe even farther.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.768
Losses in focusing ability
beyond this point

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.018
start affecting near-vision
tasks like reading,

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.643
and by the time you reach age 60,

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.018
nothing within a meter
radius of you is clear.

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.309
Right now some of you
are probably thinking,

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.643
that sounds bad but he means
you in a figurative sense,

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:19.101
only for the people that actually
end up with presbyopia.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:23.559
But no, when I say you, I literally mean
that every single one of you

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.809
will someday be presbyopic
if you aren't already.

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.226
That sounds a bit troubling.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.934
I want to remind you that presbyopia
has been with us for all of human history
