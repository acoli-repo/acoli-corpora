If you haven't heard of presbyopia,

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:34.101
and you're wondering,
"Where are these two billion people?"

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.226
here's a hint before
I get into the details.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.518
It's the reason why people wear
reading glasses or bifocal lenses.

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:42.400
I'll get started by describing
the loss in refocusing ability

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:43.934
leading up to presbyopia.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.184
As a newborn, you would have
been able to focus

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.351
as close as six and a half centimeters,

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:49.643
if you wished to.

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:52.809
By your mid-20s, you have about
half of that focusing power left.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.101
10 centimeters or so,

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.684
but close enough that you never
notice the difference.

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:57.976
By your late 40s though,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.351
the closest you can focus
is about 25 centimeters,
