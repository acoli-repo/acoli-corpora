00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:00.809
To solve this problem

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.101
Benjamin Franklin invented
what he called "double spectacles."

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.226
Today we call those bifocals,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.684
and what they let him do
was see far when he looked up

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.434
and see near when he looked down.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:14.434
Today we also have progressive lenses
which get rid of the line

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:17.059
by smoothly varying the focal power
from top to bottom.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:18.518
The downside to both of these

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:21.143
is that you lose field of vision
at any given distance,

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.768
because it gets split up
from top to bottom like this.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.184
To see why that's a problem,

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:28.059
imagine that you're climbing
down a ladder or stairs.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.684
You look down to get
your footing but it's blurry.
