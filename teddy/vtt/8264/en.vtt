00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:03.756
So there's an interesting thing
happening in the labor market.

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:06.676
On one hand, there are
a whole lot of job openings.

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:07.876
And on the other,

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:10.996
there are a lot of employers
really struggling to fill them.

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.916
Now we get this in part
because we're experiencing

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.596
an unprecedented rate of change
in the nature of work.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.556
So many jobs today require new skills.

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:23.476
Ten years ago, companies didn't need
entire teams of data engineers

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:27.076
and social media content producers
and sustainability experts.

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:30.596
But now they can barely
compete without them.
