CF: And if that happens,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.355

of the climate crisis.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.006
That's what we want to facilitate.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.790
But now, Chris, question:

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:46.505
Why are you and TED
interested in participating

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.713
and actually activating
the climate agenda,

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:53.370
when I thought you were
all about spreading ideas?

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:57.498
CA: Well, indeed, that has been
our focused mission for the last 15 years,

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:58.988
Ideas Worth Spreading.
