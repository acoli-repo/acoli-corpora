00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.709
but they are warning us
that now is the time to truly move,

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.550
because the moment we cross them,

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:08.390
like, for example, approaching
a tipping point in the Amazon rain forest,

00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:10.881
we would risk losing the battle,

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:14.676
because the planet will be taking over
its self-reinforced warming.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.096
So that is why this initiative
is so incredibly important.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.318
Let's go.

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:20.492
CA: Well said.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:21.695
(Applause)

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:26.183
So, both are very clear there
that this agenda of cutting emissions

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.052
is absolutely crucial.

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:29.276
How has that been going?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.887
CF: Not very well,
because despite what we know,
