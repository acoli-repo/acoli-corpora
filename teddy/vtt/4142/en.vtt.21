CA: Let's take this question here
and think about this.

00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:33.028
How extensively can we re-green the earth?

00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.299
I mean, there are obviously
many responses to this question,

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:37.474
many proposals.

00:10:37.498 --> 00:10:38.728
It's fundamentally about,

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:42.410
"How do we increase the amount
of sustainable photosynthesis

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.585
on planet Earth."

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:46.085
Photosynthesis sequesters carbon.

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:50.656
There could be proposals
around giant kelp forests or seagrass,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.815
or about forms of plants
that have deeper roots

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:56.856
and can sequester across the planet.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:11:02.499
But suppose a major proposal that came out
was about reforestation.
