WEBVTT

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.473
And to turn those very rivers

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:36.347
into terrible dangers for our people,

00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:41.394
as the Himalayan glaciers melt
and threaten both near-term flooding

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:47.277
and the longer-term loss
of our natural water reserves.

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:52.903
So, I'm proud to join

00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:55.403
this Countdown initiative

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:58.426
and work with all of you
and with you, and with you,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.609
(Laughter)

00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:05.327
constructively, to find solutions
that are both powerful and just.
