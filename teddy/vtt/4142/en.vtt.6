00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.149
CEOs and their customers,

00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:03.069
their employees, their investors,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:05.244
old and young,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.593
north and south.

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:08.926
CA: (Laughs) I see what you did there.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.586
(Laughter)

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.782
But look, our goal is not to plunge in

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:15.671
with something new that is competitive

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.703
with the amazing initiatives
already out there.

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:19.877
No.

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.696
It's to identify the best solutions
that have already been worked on,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.101
to cross-fertilize them, to amplify them

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.942
and then activate them

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.886
by bringing together
these different groups.
