WEBVTT

00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.817
is about to go head-to-head

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.522
with some of the world's
most amazing minds

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.395
and courageous hearts,

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.734
which look something like you.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:41.950
The extraordinary audience we have
here in New York and around the world.

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.307
Christiana, it's quite the crowd
we get to hang out with this morning.

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.387
Christiana Figueres:
It sure is, no kidding.

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.736
It's a good thing
that everyone is here together,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.475
because actually, this initiative
that we're just about to launch

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.752
needs everyone to participate.

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:58.240
And here it is.

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:00.031
Countdown.
