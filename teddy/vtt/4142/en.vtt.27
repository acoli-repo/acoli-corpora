00:13:26.142 --> 00:13:30.360
But we wanted today to introduce you
to a couple of those people,

00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:32.789
speaking from their own perspective.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:36.365
So we would like to start
with the voice of a politician.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.997
We are incredibly honored
to have with us today

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:42.505
the former prime minister of Bhutan,

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:46.236
and I will have you know that Bhutan
is the only country in the world

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.959
that actually absorbs more carbon
than what it emits.

00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:52.593
Our good friend, Tshering Tobgay.

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:59.617
(Applause)
