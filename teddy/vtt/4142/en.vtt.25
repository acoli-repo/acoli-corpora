00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:32.745
inspired the planting
of 50 million trees and counting

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:35.704
through the work of the Green
Belt Movement, one organization.

00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:37.904
But the world now needs us

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:43.061
to plant 100 times more trees
than we did then.

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:47.482
And the only way to do that
is for all of us to come together --

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:52.704
cities, citizens, governments,
companies, environmental organizations --

00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:55.220
and we must believe, therefore,

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:59.585
in the capacity for each of us
to be potent agents of change.

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:02.440
And that together, we are a force.
