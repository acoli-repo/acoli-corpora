(Video) Hoesung Lee: We recently released
three special reports

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.352
that show the damage and risks
of past and future climate change.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:41.291
They also show that stabilizing climate

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:44.522
would imply a drastic reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:45.696
in the near term.

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:49.863
Society will have to go
through unprecedented changes

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.087
to meet this goal.

00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:54.752
Even limiting warming
to 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:57.870
will bring more extreme weather,

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:00.093
rising sea levels
