00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.268
But last summer,

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:04.450
we concluded that the urgency
of some issues,

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.014
and especially climate,

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.014
demanded that we try to do more
than just spread ideas,

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.910
that we actually try to activate them.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.839
Now, we're just a relatively
small nonprofit --

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:20.172
that would not amount to anything
if we fail to bring other people on board.

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.895
But the amazing thing
is that that has happened.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.799
Everyone we've spoken to about this
has got excited about participating.

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.389
And one of the key moments, frankly,
was when you came on board, Christiana.
