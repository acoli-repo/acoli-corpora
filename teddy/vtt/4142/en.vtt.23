00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.710
transforming their lawns, their cities,
their neighborhoods,

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:32.910
going on trips together.

00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:37.091
That is where, suddenly,
you can dream about something really big.

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.593
CF: So can we test that theory?

00:11:39.617 --> 00:11:42.744
Because we are fortunate
to have with us today

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:47.649
someone who grew up inside
a tree-planting movement,

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.609
probably the most well-recognized
tree-planting movement.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.037
And she is the daughter
of the Nobel Prize winner

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:55.260
Wangari Maathai,

00:11:55.284 --> 00:11:58.640
and she heads up the Wangari Maathai
Foundation today.

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:03.239
So can we invite our very dear
friend Wanjira Mathai?
