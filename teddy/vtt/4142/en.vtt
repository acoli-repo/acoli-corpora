[Citizens of the world]

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:05.146
[We face a global crisis
of unprecedented scale]

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.529
[Please stand by for a message from ... ]

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:10.746
[the Secretary-General of 
the United Nations AntÃ³nio Guterres]

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:14.889
The climate emergency
is the defining crisis of our time.

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:17.970
We are in a race against time,
and we are losing.

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:22.009
There is a growing tide of impatience,
especially among young people,

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.761
with global inaction.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:25.697
We need more ambition from all:

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.850
governments, cities, businesses,
investors and people everywhere.
