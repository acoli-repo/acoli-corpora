00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.636
So I'm pleased you are
launching TED Countdown.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.708
Your influence and ideas
can help accelerate momentum

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.387
for a carbon-neutral world by 2050.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:43.656
That is the only way to avert
the worst impacts of global heating.

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:47.089
We have the tools, the science
and the resources.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:51.486
Let us now get into this race
with political will and energy.

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:55.796
To do anything less will be a betrayal
of our entire human family

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.669
and generations to come.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.843
Thank you.

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.183
Announcer: And now, please welcome
