00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:03.207
As the climate crisis worsens,

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:07.795
too many people are swinging
from denial straight to despair.

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.214
But we should not lose hope.

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:14.302
Humanity has enormous resources
under its command,

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:16.429
and by applying them wisely,

00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.058
we can still prevent ecological cataclysm.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.268
Let's talk numbers.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.272
What would it cost to prevent
catastrophic climate change?

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:30.735
Would we have to commit
50 percent of our total budget?
