00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.908
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor,
planning to save the world.

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:11.830
My first job was working for three months
on a lung cancer unit.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.637
Nearly all of my patients
were smokers or ex-smokers,

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.177
and most of them had started
smoking when they were children

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.923
or in their early teens.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:25.014
And despite living
in a beautiful, wealthy country,

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:28.776
with access to the most
sophisticated medicines,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
nearly every single one
of my patients died.
