00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:32.471
seven million people choose
between medicine and energy.

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:36.260
This exposes a much larger
and systemic issue.

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:41.002
Families with high energy burdens
are disproportionately people of color,

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:44.161
who spend more per square foot
than their white counterparts.

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:47.833
But it's also nurses, veterans
and even schoolteachers

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.344
who fall into the mass
of 37 million people a year

00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:55.164
who are unable to afford energy
for their most basic needs.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.948
As a result, those with
high energy burdens

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:01.877
have a greater likelihood of conditions
like heart disease and asthma.
