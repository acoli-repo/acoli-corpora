Look -- given our rockets to Mars
and our pocket-sized AI,

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:11.387
we have the tools to address
these systemic inequities.

00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:13.042
The technology is here.

00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.518
Cost of renewables, insulation,
microgrids and smart home technology

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:19.136
are all decreasing.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.268
However, even as we approach cost parity,

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:27.577
the majority of those who own solar
earn much more than the average American.

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:31.496
This is why, when I was 22,
I founded the nonprofit RETI.
