00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.480
So we start by working directly
with the communities

00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:02.554
that have the highest energy burdens.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.688
We host workshops
and events for communities

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.159
to learn about energy poverty,

00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:08.789
and how making even small
updates to their homes

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.399
like better insulation for windows
and water heaters

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.929
can go a long way to maximize efficiency.

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:17.090
We're connecting neighborhoods
to community solar

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.851
and spearheading community-led
smart home research

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.574
and installation programs

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:24.072
to help families bring down
their energy bills.

00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:26.995
We're even working directly
with elected officials,

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.737
advocating for more equitable pricing,

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:34.899
because to see this vision
of energy equity and resilience succeed,
