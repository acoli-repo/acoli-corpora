so assistance alone is not sustainable.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:05.463
But by building energy equity
and resilience into our communities,

00:04:05.487 --> 00:04:08.387
we can assure fair and impartial access

00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:11.430
to energy that is clean,
reliable and affordable.

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:16.446
At scale, microgrid technology,
clean technology and energy efficiency

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.596
dramatically improve public health.

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:21.382
And for those with high energy burdens,

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:24.581
it can help them reclaim
20 percent of their income --

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:28.526
20 percent of a person's income
who's struggling to make ends meet.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.875
This is life-changing.
