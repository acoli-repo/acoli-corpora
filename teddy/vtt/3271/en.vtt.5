This is why, when I was 22,
I founded the nonprofit RETI.

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:36.883
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens
by working with communities,

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.461
utilities and government agencies alike

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:42.361
to provide equitable access
to clean energy,

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:45.127
energy efficiency and energy technology.

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:48.499
But there's no one way to solve this.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.813
I believe in the power
of local communities,

00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:56.828
in the transforming effect
of relationships.

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.480
So we start by working directly
with the communities
