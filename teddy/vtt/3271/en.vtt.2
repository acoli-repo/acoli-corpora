00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.521
In 2015, this caused over
25 million people to skip meals

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:05.645
to provide power to their homes.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.425
This is when energy becomes a burden.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.096
But energy burdens are so much more
than just a number.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:16.745
They present impossible
and perilous choices:

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.827
Do you take your child
to get her flu medicine,

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.601
or do you feed her?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.005
Or do you keep her warm?

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:26.269
It's an impossible choice,

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:28.184
and nearly every month,

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:32.471
seven million people choose
between medicine and energy.
