00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:34.899
because to see this vision
of energy equity and resilience succeed,

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.420
we have to work together sustainably.

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:41.551
Now, the US spends
over three billion a year

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.786
on energy bill payment assistance.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.758
And these programs do help
millions of people,

00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:50.028
but they're only able to help
a fraction of those in need.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:51.267
In fact,

00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:57.017
there is a 47-billion-dollar
home-energy affordability gap,

00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.559
so assistance alone is not sustainable.
