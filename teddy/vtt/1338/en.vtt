00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm just going to talk --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
about where that's likely to carry us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you know, I saw all the visions

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the first couple of sessions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about the future.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It felt wrong to do that in some way.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And yet, I don't really think it is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because when it comes down to it,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --
