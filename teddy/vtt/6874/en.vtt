00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:11.966
After stalking an unsuspecting cuttlefish
across the seafloor,

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.678
this moray eel is finally ready to pounce.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:19.348
As the eel snags the mollusk
in its long teeth,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.684
its prey struggles to escape.

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:23.936
But before it can wriggle away,

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:27.774
a second set of teeth lunge
from the eel's throat,

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.527
making short work of the captive
cuttlefish.
