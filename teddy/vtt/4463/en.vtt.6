00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.617
but my friends and I could get busted

00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:03.190
for smoking a joint.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.749
Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.690
so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation
on international drug control.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.180
I talked my way into the State Department.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.409
I got a security clearance.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.373
I interviewed hundreds of DEA
and other law enforcement agents

00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:17.530
all around Europe and the Americas,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.761
and I'd ask them,

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.385
"What do you think the answer is?"

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.165
Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.980
"You can't really cut off the supply.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.534
The answer lies back in the U.S.,

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:30.337
in cutting off the demand."
