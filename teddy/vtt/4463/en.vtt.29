00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.561
of people who believe we 
need to turn our backs

00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.606
on the failed prohibitions of the past

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:35.305
and embrace new drug 
policies grounded in science,

00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:38.246
compassion, health and human rights,

00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:40.884
where people who come from
across the political spectrum

00:14:40.884 --> 00:14:42.865
and every other spectrum as well,

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.599
where people who love our drugs,

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:45.938
people who hate drugs,

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:48.250
and people who don't give 
a damn about drugs,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.684
but every one of us believes 
that this War on Drugs,

00:14:51.684 --> 00:14:55.931
this backward, heartless, 
disastrous War on Drugs,

00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:59.030
has got to end.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.873
Thank you.
