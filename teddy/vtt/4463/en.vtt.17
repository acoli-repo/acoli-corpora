00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:31.565
heroin and methamphetamine

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:34.130
are global commodities markets

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.325
just like the global markets 
in alcohol, tobacco,

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.205
coffee, sugar, and so many other things.

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:42.601
Where there is a demand,

00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:45.124
there will be a supply.

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.280
Knock out one source and another

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.990
inevitably emerges.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.370
People tend to think of prohibition

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.868
as the ultimate form of regulation

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:57.887
when in fact it represents 
the abdication of regulation

00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:01.904
with criminals filling the void.
