00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.763
So the challenges we face today

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:35.630
are twofold.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.645
The first is the policy challenge

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:42.323
of designing and implementing alternatives

00:12:42.323 --> 00:12:44.741
to ineffective prohibitionist policies,

00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:48.161
even as we need to get 
better at regulating

00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:51.830
and living with the drugs 
that are now legal.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.191
But the second challenge is tougher,

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.802
because it's about us.

00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:02.290
The obstacles to reform 
lie not just out there
