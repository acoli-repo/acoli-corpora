00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:30.921
and I'm guessing that some people here

00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:33.187
and maybe a few watching online,

00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:37.287
maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:39.504
or whatever who got sick,

00:15:39.504 --> 00:15:42.500
maybe died from some drug overdose.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.386
I'm sure you've had these
people approach you before.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:46.557
What do you say to them?

00:15:46.557 --> 00:15:48.739
Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the most
amazing thing that's happened of late

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.980
is that I've met a growing number of people

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.558
who have actually 
lost a sibling or a child

00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:55.184
to a drug overdose,

00:15:55.184 --> 00:15:57.160
and 10 years ago, those 
people just wanted to say,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.140
let's line up all the drug 
dealers and shoot them

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.481
and that will solve it.
