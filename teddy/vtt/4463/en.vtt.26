00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:02.290
The obstacles to reform 
lie not just out there

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.450
in the power of the 
prison industrial complex

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.654
or other vested interests 
that want to keep things

00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.080
the way they are,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.920
but within each and every one of us.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.970
It's our fears and our lack of knowledge

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:22.670
and imagination that stands 
in the way of real reform.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.240
And ultimately, I think that 
boils down to the kids,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.985
and to every parent's desire
to put our baby in a bubble,
