00:07:57.213 --> 00:08:00.396
three days a week I think yes,
three days a week I think no,

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.616
and on Sundays I'm agnostic.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:05.142
But since today is Tuesday,

00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:09.844
let me just say that legally 
regulating and taxing

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:12.262
most of the drugs that 
are now criminalized

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:14.636
would radically reduce 
the crime, violence,

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:16.368
corruption and black markets,

00:08:16.368 --> 00:08:19.405
and the problems of adulterated
and unregulated drugs,

00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:21.352
and improve public safety,

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:23.556
and allow taxpayer resources to be developed

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:25.772
to more useful purposes.

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:29.552
I mean, look, the markets 
in marijuana, cocaine,

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:31.565
heroin and methamphetamine
