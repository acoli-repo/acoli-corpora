00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:32.354
intellectual and moral puzzle.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.411
There's probably never been

00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.020
a drug-free society.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.770
Virtually every society

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.171
has ingested psychoactive substances

00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.786
to deal with pain, increase 
our energy, socialize,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.819
even commune with God.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.507
Our desire to alter our consciousness

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.937
may be as fundamental as our desires

00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:57.854
for food, companionship and sex.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.991
So our true challenge

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.871
is to learn how to live with drugs
