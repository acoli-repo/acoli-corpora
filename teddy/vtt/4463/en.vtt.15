or overdose or AIDS

00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:32.237
because our drug policies emphasize

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.261
criminalization over health.

00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:37.490

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.120
their homes, their freedom, 
even their children

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.588
to the state, not because they hurt anyone

00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.813
but solely because they chose to use one drug

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:50.827

three days a week I think yes,
three days a week I think no,
