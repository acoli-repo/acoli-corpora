00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:01.133
thought the answer lay in that area

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:04.141
about which they knew the least.

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:06.645
So that's when I started 
reading everything I could

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:09.525
about psychoactive drugs: 
the history, the science,

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.630
the politics, all of it,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.946
and the more one read,

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:16.488
the more it hit you how a thoughtful,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.852
enlightened, intelligent 
approach took you over here,

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:22.360
whereas the politics and laws of my country

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.396
were taking you over here.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:28.187
And that disparity struck me as this incredible

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:32.354
intellectual and moral puzzle.
