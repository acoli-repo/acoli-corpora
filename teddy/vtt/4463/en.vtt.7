00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:30.337
in cutting off the demand."

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:32.853
So then I go back home and I talk to people

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:35.453
involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:38.681
"You know, Ethan, you can't 
really cut off the demand.

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.628
The answer lies over there.
You've got to cut off the supply."

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.238

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.817
and they'd say, "You're 
not going to stop it here.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:51.786
The answer lies over there,

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:54.778
in cutting off supply and demand."

00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:56.408
And it hit me:

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.693
Everybody involved in this

00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:01.133
thought the answer lay in that area
