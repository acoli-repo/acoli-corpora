00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.700
Most politicians in my country

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.021
want to roll back the Drug War now,

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.833
put fewer people behind bars, not more,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.342
and I'm proud to say as an American

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:08.926
that we now lead the world

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:11.166
in reforming marijuana policies.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.112
It's now legal for medical purposes

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:14.912
in almost half our 50 states,

00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:17.274
millions of people can 
purchase their marijuana,

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:20.190
their medicine, in government-
licensed dispensaries,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.270
and over half my fellow 
citizens now say it's time

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.643
to legally regulate and tax marijuana

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:27.320
more or less like alcohol.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.287
That's what Colorado and 
Washington are doing,

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:33.673
and Uruguay, and others 
are sure to follow.
