00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.513
And in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.760
So you probably all know

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:18.414
There's a name for this darkness.

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:19.938

and social well-being.

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:28.449
One unique aspect of the energy
poverty problem in sub-Saharan Africa --

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:32.339
and by the way, in this talk
when I "energy," I mean "electricity" --
