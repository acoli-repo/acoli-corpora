WEBVTT

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:30.197
is combining that
competency-based online learning

00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.379
with the in-person learning
that we do with partners

00:03:33.403 --> 00:03:35.793
to provide all the wraparound supports.

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:38.123
That includes academic coaching.

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:39.969
It means psychosocial support,

00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:41.586
medical support,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.630
and it's also that back-end
employment support

00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:48.138
that's really resulting
in the 95 percent graduation,

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:50.257
the 88 percent employment.

00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:53.214
NDD: I'm a social media management intern.

00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:56.937
It's related to the communications
degree I'm doing.

00:03:56.961 --> 00:04:02.229
I've learned so many things
out of the project and in the real world.
