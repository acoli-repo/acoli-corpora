I could just go for it
and have a better future.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:02.540

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:05.274
Ignazio Matteini: Globally,
displaced people in the world

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.452
have been increasing.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.414
Now there are almost 60 million
people displaced in the world.

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:12.791
And unfortunately, it doesn't stop.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.984
Chrystina Russell: I think
the humanitarian community

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.273
is starting to realize
from research and reality

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:20.981
that we're talking about
a much more permanent problem.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.386
Baylie Damtie Yeshita: These students,
they need a tertiary education,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.900
a degree that they can use.

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:29.268
If the students are living now in Rwanda,

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:32.579
if they get relocated,
still they can continue their study.
