CR: The structured internship
is really an opportunity

00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:07.118
for students to practice their skills,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.493
for us to create connections
between that internship

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.038
and a later job opportunity.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.091
This is a model that really
stops putting time

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.791
and university policies
and procedures at the center

00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:25.354
and instead puts the student
at the center.

IM: The SNHU model
is a big way to shake the tree.
