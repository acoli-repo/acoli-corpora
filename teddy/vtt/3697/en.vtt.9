00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:30.730
IM: The SNHU model
is a big way to shake the tree.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.922
Huge.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:37.899
It's a huge shake to the traditional way
of having tertiary education here.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.525
BDY: It can transform
the lives of students

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.545
from these vulnerable
and refugee communities.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.006
NDD: If I get the degree,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.541
I can just come back and work
everywhere that I want.

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:55.060
I can go for a masters
confidently in English,

00:04:55.084 --> 00:04:58.384
which is something that
I would not have dreamt of before.

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:01.795
And I have the confidence
and the skills required
