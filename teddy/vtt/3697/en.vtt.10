00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:01.795
And I have the confidence
and the skills required

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.356
to actually go out
and just tackle the workplace

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.239
without having to fear
that I can't make it.

00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.779
SAS: I always wanted
to work with the community.

00:05:11.803 --> 00:05:14.420
I want to establish a nonprofit.

00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:17.725
We advocate for women's education.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.227
I want to be someone
who is, like, an ambassador

00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:23.968
and encourage them to learn

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:27.086
and tell them it is never too late.

00:05:28.206 --> 00:05:29.777
It's a dream.
