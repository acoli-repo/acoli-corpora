00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.847
We had young people going in the street,

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.697
they were having strikes.

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.738
And most of the young people died.

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:37.428
SAS: We boarded a vehicle.

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:38.652
It was overloaded.

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.181
People were running for their lives.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.662
That is how I fled from Somalia.

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.685
My mom missed me.

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:47.780
Nobody told her where I went.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.554
NDD: The fact that
we did not go to school,

00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:53.309
we couldn't go to the market,
we were just stuck home

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.937
made me realize that if I got an option
to go for something better,

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.855
I could just go for it
and have a better future.
