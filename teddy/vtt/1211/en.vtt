Images like this, from the Auschwitz
concentration camp,

00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:08.706
have been seared into our consciousness
during the 20th century

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.620
and have given us
a new understanding of who we are,

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:17.843
where we've come from
and the times we live in.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:21.464
During the 20th century,
we witnessed the atrocities

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:26.959
of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot,
Rwanda and other genocides,

00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:30.460
and even though the 21st century
is only seven years old,
