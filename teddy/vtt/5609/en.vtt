00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:12.118
This chimpanzee stumbles 
across a windfall of overripe plums.

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:14.081
Many of them have split open,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.601
drawing him 
to their intoxicating fruity odor.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.032
He gorges himself

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:23.042
and begins to experience someâ€¦ 
strange effects.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.032
This unwitting ape 
has stumbled on a process

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:28.179
that humans will eventually harness

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.192
to create 
beer, wine, and other alcoholic drinks.
