00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:01.515
suddenly, into this superstar,

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:03.713
who is kind of playing transcendentally.

00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:04.952
The reverse is also true,

00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.918
that the best coach in the league
is probably Brad Stevens

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:09.594
of the Boston Celtics.

00:13:09.618 --> 00:13:10.823
AG: I second that.

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:15.974
MG: And every time a very promising player
is traded from the Boston Celtics,

00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:17.688
they turn out to be terrible.

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:20.545
Like, they just leave Boston
and they go to another team --

00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:24.060
actually, Jae Crowder is a good example.

00:13:24.084 --> 00:13:26.520
Everyone was like,
"Oh, Jae Crowder is really good,"

00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:29.407
then Boston trades him --
"Oh, God, they traded Jae Crowder.

00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:32.010
I don't know if they can survive
without Jae Crowder."
