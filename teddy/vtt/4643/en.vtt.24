00:11:59.188 --> 00:12:02.974
In fact, the two greatest
basketball teams of all time,

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:05.537
the mid-90s Chicago Bulls,

00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:08.259
were three superstars
and then two very ordinary players.

00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:11.506
Their fifth player was a big, slow,
white guy from Australia.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.482
And if you look at Warriors
of two years ago,

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:15.863
there were three superstars,

00:12:15.887 --> 00:12:19.690
and then their fifth player was a big,
slow, lumbering white guy from Australia.

00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.182
Doesn't matter,
you could just go to Australia

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:25.070
and get some random guy
and he can be your fifth ...

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:26.864
(Laughter)

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:29.355
But what's happening now in basketball,

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:32.760
there are a couple of examples this season
that sort of go against that.
