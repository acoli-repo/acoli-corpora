00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.831
AG: So if that's true, when are you ready
for your first stand-up performance?

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.656
MG: If you're asking me --
that's not right --

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.656
The best question is, if you're asking me

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.879
would I rather teach a class
of first-graders

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:12.101
or do a stand-up performance,
the answer is

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:15.426
I would do a stand-up performance
a million times before I would teach

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.665
a class of first-graders.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.870
Infinitely harder.

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:20.262
AG: I cannot wait to present you
with both options

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:21.826
and see what you really choose.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.609
MG: It's not even close, by the way.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:26.331
(Laughter)

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:28.617
One of the things
that stand-up comedians do

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.966
that drives me crazy

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.808
is that they like to pretend
that their profession
