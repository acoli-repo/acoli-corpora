I'd love to hear a little bit
about your creative process.

00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:03.641
And where your ideas come from,
how you develop them

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:07.403
and any insights for our audience
on how to be a little bit more creative.

00:06:07.427 --> 00:06:11.672
MG: Well, you know, I did an episode
in my podcast last year

00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:12.942
called "The King of Tears"

00:06:12.966 --> 00:06:17.204
which is all about why it is
that country music can do sad songs

00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:18.656
and rock and roll can't.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.177
And one of the points I made

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:23.220
was something that I've believed
very strongly for a long time,

00:06:23.244 --> 00:06:27.299
which is that country music can be sad
when rock and roll can't

00:06:27.323 --> 00:06:29.934
because country music is specific.
