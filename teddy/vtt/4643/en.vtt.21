00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:30.926
MG: Sure.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.204
AG: Good. I rest my case.

00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:33.409
(Laughter)

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:35.069
Thank you all so much for coming.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.244
(Laughter)

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.520
MG: That's guy's theory
of what's interesting --

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:39.871
not terribly interesting.

00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:41.236
(Laughter)

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.237
AG: I mean, yes, so Davis then creates --

00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.760
this is the worst thing
for a social scientist to do,

00:10:45.784 --> 00:10:47.918
but he creates a typology
of the interesting.

00:10:47.942 --> 00:10:50.109
And he says there are
all these different ways

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.895
that you can challenge an assumption.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.427
But I think what is interesting

00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:56.261
is that, he says, not all assumptions
want to be challenged.

00:10:56.285 --> 00:10:59.705
An interesting idea is one that challenges
your weakly held assumptions.

00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:02.671
Whereas if you challenge somebody's
strongly held assumptions,
