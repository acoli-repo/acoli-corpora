00:14:28.736 --> 00:14:31.577
where you track their performance
over the course of the day

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:34.570
and the question is how many
surgeries do they have to perform

00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:37.172
with, say, minimally invasive
robot technology,

00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:40.268
before they get to the point
where they're up the learning curve.

00:14:40.292 --> 00:14:41.514
And I read in a book once

00:14:41.538 --> 00:14:43.839
that an average of 10,000 hours
could be helpful.

00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:45.037
(Laughter)

00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:47.379
That does not turn out to be the case.

00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:50.100
Practice has no effect
whatsoever in that context.

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:52.990
And they are as deadly
on surgery number 100 and 1000

00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:54.585
as they were on number one.

00:14:54.609 --> 00:14:58.093
And this is weird, because
we're supposed to learn from experience.

00:14:58.117 --> 00:15:00.990
And so what Huckman and Pisano did,
they broke down the data
