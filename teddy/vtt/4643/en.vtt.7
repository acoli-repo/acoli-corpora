in the circumstances
and the kinds of people

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.051
that they have to interact with.

00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:36.545
The comedian, by contrast,

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.926
is dealing with people
in a tightly controlled setting

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.981
with a rich set of expectations
governing their behavior,

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:44.871
where they get to turn down the lights,

00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:46.728
dose everyone with alcohol,

00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:48.458
you know, and create an expectation

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:51.506
that laughter is the appropriate response
to what they're doing.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.990
I cannot imagine
a better set of circumstances,

00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:57.935
an easier set of circumstances
for navigating a social situation,

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.117
than those.

00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.831
AG: So if that's true, when are you ready
for your first stand-up performance?
