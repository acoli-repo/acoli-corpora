00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:00.523
And that requires a lot of insight

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.601
into the immediate reaction
that your audience is going to have.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.125
And so I think comedians

Agree or disagree?

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:08.712
MG: Totally disagree.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.513
(Laughter)

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:11.719

I'm using the principal-teacher
as my model, you're using the comedian.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.379

is that the teacher is dealing with people
in a natural environment, in real time.

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:29.575
And there is an infinite variety

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.322
in the circumstances
and the kinds of people
