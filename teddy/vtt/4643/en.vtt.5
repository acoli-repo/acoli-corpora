and then the teachers who have to deal
with the kids and the parents.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:37.617
And it strikes me that you have
a very powerful lens on human beings,

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.633

but also what's right on the edge
of making people uncomfortable.

00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:00.523
And that requires a lot of insight
