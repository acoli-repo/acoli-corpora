And when you see those --
I've given a couple,

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:03.426
those specific, anecdotal examples,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.799
you then begin to wonder,

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:10.442
how many players on basketball teams,
who we consider mediocre,

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:13.474
are actually really good
but just in the wrong environment?

00:14:13.498 --> 00:14:18.604
Is Victor Oladipo an exception
or is he part of a larger trend?

00:14:19.174 --> 00:14:20.651
I'm increasingly of the opinion

00:14:20.675 --> 00:14:23.222
that there must be
lots of Victor Oladipos out there.

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:25.961
AG: I think there are,
and they're not just in basketball.

00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:28.712
This makes me think of a study
of cardiac surgeons,

00:14:28.736 --> 00:14:31.577
where you track their performance
over the course of the day
