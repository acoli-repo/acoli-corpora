And specificity is something
I've become increasingly interested in

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.490
as a trait of interestingness.

00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:43.006
That all the interesting people I know
are people whose speech and thinking

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.905
have a great deal of specificity to it.

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:50.624
So I was listening, for example,
to an interview with Rostam Batmanglij --

00:06:50.648 --> 00:06:51.831
AG: Is that a person?

00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:57.003
MG: Yes, he's a brilliant musician
who was one half of "Vampire Weekend"

00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:58.347
before they broke up.

00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:03.799
And I happen to know his brother,
who's also a brilliant director.
