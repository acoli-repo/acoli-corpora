00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:32.760
there are a couple of examples this season
that sort of go against that.

00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:35.554
One is that one of the best
guards in the game this season

00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:37.749
was this guy named Victor Oladipo, on OKC.

00:12:37.773 --> 00:12:39.773
And he was considered a disaster.

00:12:40.538 --> 00:12:44.831
And he simply moves teams
to a new environment

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:46.457
with, presumably, a better coach,

00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:48.632
he's no longer playing

00:12:48.656 --> 00:12:51.092
who's probably a very
difficult person to play with.

00:12:51.116 --> 00:12:52.659
And simply by moving teams,

00:12:52.683 --> 00:12:56.442
he went from being someone
who was widely considered to be a bust,

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:59.664
someone who'd be washing out
of the league soon, a mediocre player,

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:01.515
suddenly, into this superstar,
