that confirms everything I always
thought was true about the world,

00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.791
I'm not that excited.

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:06.141
If you have a specific theory that --

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:09.037
I read a "Malcolm Gladwell
Book Generator" once.

00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:12.680
They created fake book titles of yours,
and one of them that I remember was,

00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:15.847
"Nothing -- What Sand Castles
Can Tell Us About North Korea."

00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:18.236
(Laughter)

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.490
Like, that's interesting.

00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:21.410
I'm like, wow, never would have thought

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:23.537
that a sand castle
could explain North Korea.

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:24.727
(Laughter)

00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:29.099
And so, don't you think that specificity
needs to be coupled with surprise?

00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:30.926
MG: Sure.
