00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.156
AG: They're hanging out
with the wrong comedians.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.958
MG: No, but it's my point,
they control their environments.

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:36.672
No one controls their environments
better than comedians.

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:38.720
That's how they manage to do what they do.

00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:41.569
AG: And so you don't think
that still requires deep insight

00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:43.482
into human behavior or psychology?

00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:45.117
MG: Not deep insight.

00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:47.489
Talking to drunk people
requires some insight.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.466
(Laughter)

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.149
AG: You may be doing it right now.

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:53.863
(Laughter)

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:55.829
Let's shift gears a little bit.

00:05:55.853 --> 00:05:58.305
I want to talk about your work life.

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.099
I'd love to hear a little bit
about your creative process.
