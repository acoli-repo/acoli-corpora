00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.472
For this bonus episode, Malcolm and I
sat down at the 92nd Street Y.

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.294
I have to say, you're my favorite
sparring partner.

00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:08.087
In the sense that you really take joy
in intellectual disagreement.

00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.826
I've discovered that I do, too.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.807
And so my hope is that we will disagree
on some things tonight.

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:14.006
MG: Good.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.228
(Laughter)

00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:17.838
AG: When we do, I hope
you take that as a sign

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.521
that I respect your opinion enough
to want to change it.

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:22.076
(Laughter)

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.250
MG: Alright.

00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:26.925
AG: And ideally, I will win
more of these arguments than I'll lose.

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:29.012
Is that fair in ground rules?

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:32.996
MG: Sure, I'm happy to lose
arguments to you anytime you want.
