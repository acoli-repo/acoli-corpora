MG: Sure, I'm happy to lose
arguments to you anytime you want.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.916
AG: Great! We should do this more often.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.910
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.712
The place I wanted to start is to say
that when I think about work life,

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:44.808
we both spend a huge part
of our work lives

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:46.261
thinking about human behavior.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.547
And trying to understand it
and make sense of it

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.648
and maybe even make it
a little bit better.

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.895
And we're both in jobs that have
a pretty strong monopoly on that,

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.537
between journalism and social science.

00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:59.229
I'm curious, outside of our jobs,

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.164
what you would say is the occupation
that has the most insight
