00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:00.476
And that quality of being specific

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.595
and being able to illustrate
your larger points

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:05.666
with that kind of precision

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.165
is the quality of what makes
something interesting.

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.459
Ever since I've come to understand this,

00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:14.505
that has informed
the way I look for ideas.

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:21.319
So I'm trying to be as precise
as possible in how I illustrate an idea.

00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:24.993
And to understand that in the service
of illustrating an idea,

00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:28.065
you don't want to skate over the surface.

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:30.101
AG: But isn't that
what you've always done?
