AG: But isn't that
what you've always done?

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.847
Like, here's a story about a statue.

00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:35.283
And oh, my gosh, that changes
your entire understanding of intuition.

00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:38.022
And here's a story about
a hockey team or a soccer team.

00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:39.279
And all of a sudden,

00:08:39.303 --> 00:08:41.799
we're going to reimagine how success works

00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:44.664
and think it's much more
luck and opportunity than we think.

00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:46.895
MG: Yeah, but I think
I did it in the beginning

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.998
without realizing that's what I was doing.

00:08:49.022 --> 00:08:51.474
So, you ask me what my creative process is

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.760
and the answer is, I've only recently
become kind of conscious of it,

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.791
and I realize, you know, with the podcast,

00:08:56.815 --> 00:09:00.263
you have to crank up
the specificity even more.
