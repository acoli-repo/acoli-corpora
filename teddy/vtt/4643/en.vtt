Adam Grant: I used to dread
going to parties.

00:00:05.127 --> 00:00:07.254
I stood around,
struggling with small talk,

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:09.808
waiting for an opening
to dive into big ideas.

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.641
That changed in 2000,
when I was a freshman in college

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:16.268
and I read Malcolm Gladwell's book
"The Tipping Point."

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:18.061
Malcolm Gladwell: So, what is a book?

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.299
A book is 75,000 words.

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:22.228
In a good day, you should be able
to write 1,000 words a day.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:24.569
So you should be able
to do a draft of a book,

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:26.410
if you know what you're writing about,

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:27.696
in 75 days.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.537
Now that's absurd, of course,
no one does a book in 75 days.
