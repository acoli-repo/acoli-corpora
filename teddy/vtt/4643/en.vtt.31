00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:30.307
who knows my strengths and weaknesses,

00:15:30.331 --> 00:15:32.688
and we've developed a set
of effective routines.

00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:35.819
And that kind of suggests
that performance and skill and expertise

00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:38.791
is team-specific, it's context-specific.

00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:41.855
And then you see the same thing
in financial services companies.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:44.545
There's this great
Boris Groysberg et Al. study

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.696
where they look
at star financial analysts.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.601
And the question is,
if they get poached by a different firm,

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.260
what happens to their performance?

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.589
And on average, it takes them five years
to recover their star status.

00:15:54.613 --> 00:15:56.450
Unless they take their team with them.

00:15:56.474 --> 00:15:58.855
In which case they show
no dip in performance.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:00.045
And that makes me think
