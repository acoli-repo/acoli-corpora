00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.537
Now that's absurd, of course,
no one does a book in 75 days.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.472
AG: Malcolm made it cool
to talk about social science.

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:37.466
And that started me down the path
of becoming a psychologist and an author.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.482
Malcolm and I have become friends.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.672
But here's the thing:
we don't always see eye to eye.

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:46.188
Which is part of the fun of getting
on stage about once a year to debate.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.403
I think comedians
are master psychologists.

00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:49.628
Agree or disagree?

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.061
MG: Totally disagree.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.752
(Laughter)

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:56.213
AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.472
For this bonus episode, Malcolm and I
sat down at the 92nd Street Y.
