00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.164
what you would say is the occupation
that has the most insight

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.655
into human nature and human behavior?

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.767
MG: Well, I mean, there are obvious ones.

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.775
Teachers would be the first.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.121
And by extension, all the professions
attached to that.

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.048
So, my brother is a principal.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.913
I always feel like,
in the position he's in --

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.522
he's a principal of an elementary school,

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:29.569
so he interacts with kids, their parents,

00:02:29.593 --> 00:02:32.870
and then the teachers who have to deal
with the kids and the parents.
