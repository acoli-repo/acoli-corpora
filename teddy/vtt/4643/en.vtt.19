This is bad news.

00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:33.378
But then he's kind of
proving his point, in a meta way.

00:09:33.402 --> 00:09:35.680
And then he says
what makes an idea interesting.

00:09:35.704 --> 00:09:37.664
He says, "What makes an idea interesting

00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:39.974
is when it departs
from conventional wisdom."

00:09:39.998 --> 00:09:41.998
If somebody just affirms your assumptions,

00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:44.237
you don't get curious,
you don't get intrigued,

00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:45.426
there's no surprise.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.895
You know, like, boom --
confirmation bias, all good!

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.926
When you're interested
is when you're like,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.545
"Ha, that's the opposite
of what I would have thought."

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.180
Or, "That's different
from what I would have believed."

00:09:55.204 --> 00:09:57.315
And I don't think
specificity gets you there.

00:09:57.339 --> 00:09:59.355
I think if you have
a really specific story

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:02.617
that confirms everything I always
thought was true about the world,
