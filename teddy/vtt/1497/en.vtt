00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:05.193
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.

00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:10.561
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.258
and that means that I spend a good amount of time

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:18.632
designing and building new pieces of technology,

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:23.172
and more specifically designing and building electronics.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:27.530
And what I've found is that the process of designing

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.124
and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.
