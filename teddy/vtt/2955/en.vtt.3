00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.127
It took weeks before I could admit it,

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:31.580
but the doctor was right:

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:32.882
I was depressed.

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:36.959
Still, I didn't tell anybody
about my diagnosis.

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.135
I was too ashamed.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.676
I didn't think I had the right
to be depressed.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.048
I had a privileged life

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:47.172
with a loving family
and a successful career.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.300
And when I thought about
the unspeakable horrors

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:52.812
that my ancestors
had been through in this country

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.804
so that I could have it better,

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.506
my shame grew even deeper.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.073
I was standing on their shoulders.

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:00.699
How could I let them down?
