00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:32.162
She's right.

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:36.208
We have got to retire
those tired, old narratives

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:37.787
of the strong black woman

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.021
and the super-masculine black man,

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.965
who, no matter how many times
they get knocked down,

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.224
just shake it off and soldier on.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.485
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.404
Feelings mean we're human.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.869
And when we deny our humanity,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.009
it leaves us feeling empty inside,

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:00.037
searching for ways to self-medicate
in order to fill the void.
