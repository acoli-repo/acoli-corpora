00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:00.037
searching for ways to self-medicate
in order to fill the void.

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.330
My drug was high achievement.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.672
These days, I share my story openly,

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.906
and I ask others to share theirs, too.

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.854
I believe that's what it takes

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.473
to help people who may
be suffering in silence

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:16.706
to know that they are not alone

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.415
and to know that with help,

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.780
they can heal.

00:05:19.804 --> 00:05:21.969
Now, I still have my struggles,

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:24.281
particularly with the anxiety,

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:25.908
but I'm able to manage it

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:30.806
through daily mediation,
yoga and a relatively healthy diet.
