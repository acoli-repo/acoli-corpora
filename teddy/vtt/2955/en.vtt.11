through daily mediation,
yoga and a relatively healthy diet.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.898
(Laughter)

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:34.144
If I feel like things
are starting to spiral,

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.212
I make an appointment to see my therapist,

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.299
a dynamic black woman
named Dawn Armstrong,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:41.296
who has a great sense of humor

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.557
and a familiarity that I find comforting.

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:46.764
I will always regret

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.456
that I couldn't be there for my nephew.

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.013
But my sincerest hope

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.766
is that I can inspire others
with the lesson that I've learned.

00:05:59.182 --> 00:06:01.652
Life is beautiful.
