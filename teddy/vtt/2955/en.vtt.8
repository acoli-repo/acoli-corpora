Now, here's the good news:

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:04.885
seventy percent of people
struggling with depression will improve

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.266
with therapy, treatment and medication.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.120
Armed with this information,

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:12.851
I made a decision:

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:15.843
I wasn't going to be silent anymore.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.543
With my family's blessing,

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:20.460
I would share our story

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:23.298
in hopes of sparking
a national conversation.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.911
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.426
"Being strong is killing us."
