00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:00.699
How could I let them down?

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.435
I would hold my head up,

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.819
put a smile on my face

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.551
and never tell a soul.

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:13.743
On July 4, 2013,

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.667
my world came crashing in on me.

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.300
That was the day I got
a phone call from my mom

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:24.514
telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,
Paul, had ended his life,

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:27.179
after years of battling
depression and anxiety.

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.823
There are no words that can describe
the devastation I felt.
