00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:31.173
You see, a few years ago,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.694
I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety

00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:34.868
and depression --

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.709
two conditions that often go hand in hand.

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:42.338
Now, there was a time
I wouldn't have told anybody,

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.822
especially not in front of a big audience.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:46.373
As a black woman,

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:50.037
I've had to develop
extraordinary resilience to succeed.

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.040
And like most people in my community,

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:55.872
I had the misconception that depression
was a sign of weakness,

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.432
a character flaw.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.030
But I wasn't weak;

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:00.524
I was a high achiever.
