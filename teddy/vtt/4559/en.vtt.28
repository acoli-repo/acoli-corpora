00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:02.087
to which access depends upon how much
money you've got in your pocket.

00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.919
It's a polarizing and negative force.

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.340
We see it in this city,

00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:07.582
and we're seeing it more
and more other cities.

00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:10.320
And what ends up happening

00:14:10.344 --> 00:14:13.872
is that we end up with this sort of stack,
that's like a time bomb.

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:17.672
At some point the system must collapse,
it's really not sustainable.

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:20.146
It's like the economic
system in the world today --

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.957
it's really not a sustainable system,

00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:24.023
and we have to find ways of addressing it.

00:14:24.047 --> 00:14:26.729
Design can't provide the solution,

00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:31.030
but what it can address is some
of the conditions that people live with.
