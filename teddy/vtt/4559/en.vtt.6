00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.824
And a big part of architecture
and a big part of design

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.796
involves understanding the context
in which that design exists

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.354
or in which it's going to exist.

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:09.315
It's having the imagination
to try and predict or project

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.136
where the building
or where the urban space

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.326
or where the landscape
is going to be located,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.673
how it's going to be used,

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.958
what are the operations,
what are the activities

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.014
that are going to take place
in that space.

00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:23.180
And you might call those
the programmatic aspects of architecture,

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.926
the programmatic aspects of design.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.947
And I think that in recent times,
we've tended to privilege

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.074
or put at a higher level
