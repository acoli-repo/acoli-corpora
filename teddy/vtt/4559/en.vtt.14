It also suggested that it's a constant,

00:07:08.617 --> 00:07:11.315
And I think that's a very
important thing to understand,

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.036
that it's also part of the program.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.023

is something that can be imagined.

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:31.785
In the same way as we can conceive
and imagine of a space or a building,
