how we can identify small moves
or small gestures,

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:04.680
whether through design or economic
initiative or social initiative

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:08.380
that effect change and that allow
transformation of spaces

00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:12.287
that encourage and facilitate
greater participation.

00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:15.030
And there are lots of ways of doing that.

00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:17.685
And whilst it might seem complex
when we look at cities,

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:21.188
when we look at the aggregate parts
of cities, it may seem insurmountable.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:25.201
But if we try and isolate individual acts,
individual ways of looking at things

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:30.075
and formulate a program, a manner or way
of understanding how we can do that,
