00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.538
a big conurbation of lots and lots
of complex ideas.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.877
The Italian architect Aldo Rossi,

00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:37.958
a 20th-century architect who died
at the end of the last century,

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:39.742
made a very profound statement.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:43.999
He said architecture is the making
of the city over time.

00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:45.857
I think that's a great statement,

00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:49.233
because it talks, on one level,
about the individual production

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:51.459
and manufacture
of an object -- architecture --

00:06:51.483 --> 00:06:55.212
and it talks about architecture
as being a form of cultural production,

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:57.939
as something that speaks to an issue

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:01.633
or speaks to ideas that are bigger
than the sum of the parts of the building,
