00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:02.091
from a colonial plan that was developed
following some ordinances

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.740
sent out by the king of Spain,

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:05.301
called the Laws of the Indies.

00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.778
Many cities in the Caribbean
and Latin America

00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:09.728
were predicated and formulated on this.

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:12.203
It was a gesture, it was a single design

00:08:12.227 --> 00:08:15.072
that addressed the needs
and the requirements

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:17.512
of those establishing
cities and new colonies.

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:21.830

as trade began to develop in Trinidad,

00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:23.630
the city expanded, and it grew,

00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:28.267
and it started appropriating,
more and more, the surrounding landscape,

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.602
until it grew to pretty much
what we have today,
