00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.602
until it grew to pretty much
what we have today,

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:33.610
or what we understand to be
the city of Port of Spain.

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.188
But as we all know,

00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:40.808
that process grew also on a kind
of macro scale as well.

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:44.855
We have the evolution and the development
of this big conurbation

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:47.909
that stretches from Port
of Spain to the west

00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.933
and over to Arouca in the east

00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:51.535
and seems to be continuing.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:53.774

00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:56.957
that far exceeds the original
Laws of the Indies plan.

00:08:56.981 --> 00:09:01.457
And it's turned into a complex
arrangement and matrix
