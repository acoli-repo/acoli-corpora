on ensuring that those types
of buildings proliferate,

00:13:30.516 --> 00:13:33.958
because they're seen as positive
aspects of development --

00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:38.553
at the expense of types of building
and types of program

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:40.502
that could be beneficial to everybody,

00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:43.012
types of program
that encourage interaction,

00:13:43.036 --> 00:13:44.282
that encourage education,

00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:46.409
that encourage people
to be with each other

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:48.170
and encourage a sense of community.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.597
These types of development
dissipate society,

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:54.363
they disaggregate society,
they polarize society.

00:13:54.387 --> 00:13:57.775
They create isolated groups of activity

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:02.087
to which access depends upon how much
money you've got in your pocket.
