00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.198
or ideas that are, in fact,
maybe a lot more pervasive

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:35.465
than the two-dimensional image can convey.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.503
And I think that's true
about architecture.

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:40.585
I think we've grown accustomed
to thinking about architecture

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.018
in a really primarily
two-dimensional way, in a flat way,

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.992
that the building is about
what it looks like, how it appears,

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.952
it's visual commodity.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.380
But it's much more than that.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.368
It's much more than an aesthetic
or just a sensory experience.

00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:55.636
That's very important,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.111
but it's much more than that.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.716
It's a complex operation.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.824
And a big part of architecture
and a big part of design
