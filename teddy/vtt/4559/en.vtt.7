or put at a higher level

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:35.063
that visual sensory perception
or desire about architecture

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:38.718
ahead and in advance
of those programmatic needs.

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:41.541
We've tended to kind of
create monuments, create icons

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.529
that create a sensation or create effect,

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:47.054
without really thinking through
the value of the operation

00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:50.468
that those places
or those spaces can affect.

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:54.071

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:55.253
or trying to understand

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.516
how architecture or how design
can really impact on society,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.987
and how it can address
some of the problems
