00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:30.887
and it's difficult to comprehend.

00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:32.531
And when we think of the problems,

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:36.001
we think of the infrastructural problems:
the water, the power,

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:37.891
the traffic congestion,

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:41.943
the crime, the segregation,
the polarization that exists,

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:45.310
the situation that has led to what's
happened in this country recently

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:46.827
with the state of emergency ...

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:49.004
Sometimes it seems
completely insurmountable.

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:53.362
It seems like we've got to a point
where we can't really control it

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:55.742
in the way that we can control
that original plan.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:57.537
We can't really control this anymore.

00:09:57.561 --> 00:09:59.732
It's almost as if we're
victims of the city,

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:03.037
rather than people that have willingly
or willfully designed the city
