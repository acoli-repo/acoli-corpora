00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:33.365
The environment
that we live in is challenged.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.341
We've got global warming,
we've got rising tides,

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:38.717
we've got all sorts
of disasters taking place,

00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:40.411
all sorts of things happening

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:45.516
that threaten the equilibrium of the world
and the environment that we live in.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.105
And society itself
is also challenged and threatened

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.259
by some of the issues
that we're faced with.

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:53.249
I think we've heard about
some of those issues today

00:04:53.273 --> 00:04:57.012
and the need to change the paradigm
in which we perceive those things.

00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:59.018
It's really very crucial that we do that.
