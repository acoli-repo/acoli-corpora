00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.186
there have been times when cities
have done that very successfully.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.371
There are lots of examples
of very good cities

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:08.586
which have found themselves
at a specific moment in time

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.473
at a point of balance or equilibrium.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.180
If we look at Port of Spain as a city,

00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:17.464
and we consider the idea
that, once upon a time,

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:20.043
Port of Spain was just a little cluster,

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.966
a little fishing village
at the mouth of the St. Ann's River.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.227
And yet it's grown to be
such a big, complex conglomeration,

00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.538
a big conurbation of lots and lots
of complex ideas.
