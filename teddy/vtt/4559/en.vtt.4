It's become reduced in many ways

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:03.517
to a perception that is two-dimensional.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.878

looking at the world through screens,

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:12.765
whether it's our laptops
or television screens

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.774
or monitors at airports
or in the workplace

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.510

or our notion of certain concepts

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.198
or ideas that are, in fact,
maybe a lot more pervasive
