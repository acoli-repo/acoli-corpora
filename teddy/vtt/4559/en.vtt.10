00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.981
So how does design impact that?

00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:05.272
How can how can I, as a designer,
or anybody as a designer

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:06.941
or any architect

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:08.369
or how can society --

00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:11.445
in what way can design impact on that,

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.467
in what way can it affect that?

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:14.658
I'm going to talk today

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:17.406
about ways in which I think
design can impact on society,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.343
very specifically on society,

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:25.474
and how that idea of design
can infiltrate the idea of society

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:28.516
and work with society
in the operations of society

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.269
in this programmatic way
