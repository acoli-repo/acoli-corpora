00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.269
in this programmatic way

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.725
to effect social change.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.221
This is an image of Frederick Street
in the early part of the last century.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:40.662
And I think it's a good image
in lots of ways.

00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:44.554
It seems like that little triangulation
of the environment,

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.898
the economy and society

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.929
seems to be in a kind of balance.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:52.283
So it seems that in cities
we can see that balance

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:54.122
that cities are symbols or ciphers

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:58.739
or ways in which we can we can understand
the confluence of those forces.

00:05:58.763 --> 00:05:59.925
And through time,

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.186
there have been times when cities
have done that very successfully.
