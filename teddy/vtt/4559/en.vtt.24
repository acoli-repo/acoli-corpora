00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.580
that's why they are privileged
above other types of development.

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:06.117
But schools,

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.363
parks,

00:12:08.387 --> 00:12:11.897
elements of cities that used to be really
significant and really important

00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.774
are being diminished and marginalized

00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:17.068

the capacity of the city

00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:25.402
to accommodate social interaction,

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:27.009
to accommodate everybody,

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:31.545
because the other thing
is they're also exclusive.
