00:10:59.432 --> 00:11:01.462
to create how it's to increase the speed

00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:04.011
with which we can get
from one point to another.

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:06.049
And then we also have
suburban development.

00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:07.683
These are all typologies

00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.902
that are emblematic of the type
of development that has taken place

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:14.225
in modern cities, in Port of Spain
and cities all over the world.

00:11:14.249 --> 00:11:16.457
Now, there's nothing wrong
with shopping malls,

00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.214
there's nothing wrong with highways,

00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:21.820
and there's nothing wrong with high-rise
buildings or suburban development.

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:24.424
What is kind of wrong
is that what we seem to be doing

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:27.005
is privileging types or ways of building

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:28.822
or ideas about building

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:30.843
above other really very important ways
