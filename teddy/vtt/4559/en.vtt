00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:05.076
We've been asked to address
the theme of changing conversations.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.305
And I think certainly
in the field that I'm in,

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.574
that's a really important point to be at.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:12.512
From the discourses that are going on
within architecture

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.131
as well as throughout society,

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:18.602
I think it is time to change
the way that we look at things.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:22.438
As an architect, I've been involved
with architectural projects,

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:24.359
with urban planning projects,

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.963
and more recently, projects that engage
much more with the landscape.

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:29.957
Now I can see so many opportunities

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:33.164
and so many ways
in which design can contribute
