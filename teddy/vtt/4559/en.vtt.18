00:08:56.981 --> 00:09:01.457
And it's turned into a complex
arrangement and matrix

00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:04.129
of infrastructures and complex issues,

00:09:04.153 --> 00:09:07.874
issues that, in many ways,
have led to a lot of problems.

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:10.306
They've led to a lot
of infrastructural problems.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.877
And we share this
with many, many cities in the world.

00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.221
Cities all over the world
are expanding, they're increasing,

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:19.444
they're undergoing the same type
of development that we've undergone

00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:23.218
to the point where the original Port
of Spain and the downtown Port of Spain

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:26.091
that used to comprise the city,
used to constitute the city,

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:29.271
has now turned into this sort
of megalopolis, this sprawl,

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:30.887
and it's difficult to comprehend.
