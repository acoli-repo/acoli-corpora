WEBVTT

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.987
and how it can address
some of the problems

00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:02.247
that we're facing.

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.781
The big buzzword in design
and in what I do

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:06.289
and I think what everybody does

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:08.097
is the idea of sustainability.

00:04:09.464 --> 00:04:12.691
Sustainability is an idea,
a notion or a concept

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:17.666
that's triangulated by three very
important concepts or ideas:

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.815
the environment, the economy and society.

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:26.007
Well, the global economy seems to be
currently in a kind of meltdown situation.

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:28.763
A lot of work needs to be done there.

00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:33.365
The environment
that we live in is challenged.
