00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:31.545
because the other thing
is they're also exclusive.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:35.707
To work in a high-end office,
you need to be qualified,

00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:36.901
you need to be educated,

00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:38.981
or you need to have
access or the resources

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:42.852
to get the qualifications or the training
that allow you to get the job in there.

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:45.314
If you don't have those,
you work outside somewhere.

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:47.830
We're not concerned about
what those places are like,

00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:49.573
you just go and work somewhere else.

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:52.185
Similarly, those people that used
to live in the cities

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:54.664
or used to live and contribute
to the life of cities

00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:58.405
are being pushed out because buildings
like high-rise buildings push them out.

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:04.128
There's a premium on land price
that pushes people out of cities.
