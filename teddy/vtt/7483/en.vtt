You're sitting at your computer,
about to apply for your dream job,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.793
but then thoughts
start to go through your head

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:07.468
that this is a waste of your time.

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:08.643
Maybe you're thinking,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.309
"My parents didn't go to college,"

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.086
or "I have a learning disability."

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.495
"When I went on their website

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.225
and I looked at the folks
in the most senior level roles,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.816
I didn't see anyone who represented
my race or my gender."

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.106
"There's just no way
I'm going to get this job."

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.905
So you don't even submit the application.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.265
But I'm here to tell you
that your self-doubt

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.096
about your experiences can be the key
