00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.056
and so I minored in education
and I took all the appropriate courses,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.976
and then when it was time
for me to go for my license,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.656
I had to take a written exam,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.336
an oral exam

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.296
and a medical exam.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.536
At that time, all three of those exams

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.216
were given in completely
inaccessible buildings,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.496
so I had friends who carried me
up and down the steps

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.096
for these exams,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.776
not in a motorized wheelchair.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.816
(Laughter)

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.320
In a manual wheelchair.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.216
But I passed my oral exam.
