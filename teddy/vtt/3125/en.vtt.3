00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.896
and my mother, like mothers and fathers
all across the United States,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.696
was taking me to school to enroll,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.056
she pushed my wheelchair to the school
in walking distance to our house,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.176
pulled the wheelchair
up the steps into the school,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.376
and we were greeted by the principal.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.256
Not really greeted.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.856
But the principal said,
no, I couldn't come to that school

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.576
because it wasn't accessible.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.976
But he told us not to worry,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.176
because the Board of Education in fact
would send a teacher to my house.
