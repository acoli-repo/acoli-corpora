00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.016
I didn't actually get to go to school
in a real building

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.176
until I was nine years old,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.376
and then I was in classes
only with disabled children

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.616
in a school that had
mainly nondisabled children.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.496
And in my classes,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.720
there were students up to the age of 21.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.696
And then, after 21,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.056
they went to something
called sheltered workshops

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.696
with menial work

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.920
and earning either nothing
or below minimum wage.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.576
So I understood discrimination.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.376
My parents understood discrimination.
