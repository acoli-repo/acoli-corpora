00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.576
that we needed to fight back people's view

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.936
that if you had a disability,
you needed to be cured,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.016
that equality was not
part of the equation.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.336
And we were learning
from the Civil Rights Movement

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.496
and from the Women's Rights Movement.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.696
We were learning from them
about their activism

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.736
and their ability to come together,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.496
not only to discuss problems

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.456
but to discuss solutions.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.880
And what was born is what we call today
the Disability Rights Movement.
