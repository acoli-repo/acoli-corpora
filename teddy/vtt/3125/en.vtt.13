00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.256
This is a really important
time in my life,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.216
because it would be the first time

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.736
that I really would be
challenging the system, me,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.496
and although I was working with a lot
of other friends who had disabilities

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.096
who were encouraging me
to move forward with this,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.696
it was nonetheless quite frightening.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.296
But I was really very lucky.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.536
I had a friend who was a disabled student
at Long Island University

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.816
and was also a stringer
at the "New York Times,"

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.496
and he was able to get a reporter

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.416
to write a really good piece
about what had happened
