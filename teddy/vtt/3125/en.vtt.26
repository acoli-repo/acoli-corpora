00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.480
More than 165 countries
have joined this treaty.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.256
It is the first international
human rights treaty

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.840
fully focused on disabled people.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.656
But I am sad to say that our US Senate

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.936
has failed to recommend to our president
that we ratify the treaty.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.896
We signed it in 2009,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.136
but it doesn't come
into force until ratification,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.376
and the president --
no president can ratify a treaty
