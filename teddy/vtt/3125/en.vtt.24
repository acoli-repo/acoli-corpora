For any of you in the room

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.616
who are 50 or older,
or maybe or even 40 or older,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.816
you remember a time when
there were no ramps on the streets,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.896
when buses were not accessible,

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.896
when trains were not accessible,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.736
where there were no wheelchair-accessible
bathrooms in shopping malls,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.896
where you certainly did not have
a sign language interpreter,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.096
or captioning, or braille
or other kinds of supports.
