00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.216
But I passed my oral exam.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.400
I passed my written exam.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.640
My medical exam was something
completely different.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.736
One of the first questions
the doctor asked me

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.040
was, could I please show her
how I went to the bathroom.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.696
I was 22 years old

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.296
and you know when you go
for any kind of an interview,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.576
you think about all the kinds
of questions that people could ask you?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.296
(Laughter)

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.560
That was not one of them.
