00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.520
I'd like to see by a show of hands
how many of you have ever broken a bone?

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.576
And then, when you leave today, I'd like
you to maybe write a couple of sentences

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.456
about what that period of time
has been like for you,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.016
because frequently I hear from people,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.056
"You know, I couldn't do this,
I couldn't do that.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.376
People talked to me differently.
They acted differently towards me."

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.256
And that's what I see
and other disabled people see

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.840
in flashing letters.
