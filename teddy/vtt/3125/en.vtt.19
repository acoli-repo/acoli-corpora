00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.600
So I'd like to tell you
a couple of riddles.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.080
How many people do you think it takes

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.856
to stop traffic on Madison Avenue

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.416
during rush hour in New York City?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.056
Do you have a guess? How many?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.795
(Audience members shout out answers)

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.560
Fifty.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.720
One would be too little.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.416
Fifty people.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.176
And there were no accessible paddy wagons,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.936
so they had to just kind of deal with us.
