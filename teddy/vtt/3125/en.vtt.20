00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.936
so they had to just kind of deal with us.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.256
(Laughter)

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.256
(Applause)

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.616
But let me tell you another riddle.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.336
How many people does it take
to stop a bus in New York City

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.920
when they refuse to let you on
because you're in a wheelchair?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.496
One. That is the right answer.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.416
So what you have to do though

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.296
is take your wheelchair --

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.296
(Laughter)

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.176
Sidle in the right place
right in front of the steps
