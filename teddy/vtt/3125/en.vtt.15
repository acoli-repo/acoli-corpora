and I was interviewing him.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.896
He didn't know that.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.656
And at the end of our discussion, I said,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.616
"Would you be willing to represent me?
I want to sue the Board of Education."

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.256
And he said yes.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.816

were aligned around this court case,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.296
because we had an amazing judge:

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.536
the first African American
female federal judge --

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.216
