Someone who looks like me
walks past you in the street.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.751
Do you think they're a mother,

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:10.199
a refugee

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.253
or a victim of oppression?

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:14.454
Or do you think they're a cardiologist,

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:15.496
a barrister

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:17.285
or maybe your local politician?

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:20.283
Do you look me up and down,

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:21.775
wondering how hot I must get

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.504
or if my husband has forced me
to wear this outfit?

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.261
What if I wore my scarf like this?
