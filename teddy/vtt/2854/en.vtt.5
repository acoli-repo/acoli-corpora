So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.616
where people are saying,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.656
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
or these poor black and Latino kids,"

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.696
instead of an empathetic approach,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.136
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.376
"I know the adversities that you're facing

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.240
and I want to help you overcome them."

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.256
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.776
I share that one of the biggest reasons

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.880
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.456
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,
