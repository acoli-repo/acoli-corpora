00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.532
And I started with summer school.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.296
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.656
which is the disparity
in educational attainment

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.856
between rich kids and poor kids

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.016
or black kids and white kids,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.720
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.456
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.536
of what they learned
during the school year

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.896
over the summer.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.536
They return to school in the fall,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.616
and their teachers
spend another two months

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.056
reteaching them old material.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.576
That's five months.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.216
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.
