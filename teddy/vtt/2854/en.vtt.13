"Nah. No way."

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.216
What's even more exciting

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.416
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.400
just by redesigning two months,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.136
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.720
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.376
Thank you.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.061
