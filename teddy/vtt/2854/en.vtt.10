00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.376
What if empowered high-achieving kids

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.816
as mentors to tutor their younger peers

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.160
and inspire them
to invest in their education?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.376
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.616
asked them what colleges
they were going to,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.600
designed a summer school
they want to attend

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.936
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.160
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.896
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.856
trained over 300 aspiring teachers
