00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.216
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.856
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
that's half of their education.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.320
Half.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.240
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.320
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.976
For kids it feels like punishment,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.336
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.816
when the school year
ends the last week of June

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.200
and then summer school starts
just one week later?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.536
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,
