00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.656
Just the way that question is phrased

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.440
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000
Nowadays I get asked a different question.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.960
"How were you able to make it out?"

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.120
For years I said I was lucky,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.520
but it's not just luck.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.856
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.136
at the very same time

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.376
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.856
I wanted to understand why he dropped out

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.080
and I kept studying.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.616
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar
