they now go back four months ahead in math

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.616

(Applause)

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.696
Ten years ago, if you would have told me

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.896
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.896
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.960
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.416

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.560
"Nah. No way."
