00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.856
trained over 300 aspiring teachers

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.176
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.240
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.800
(Applause)

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.176
And our kids are succeeding.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.176
Two years of independent evaluations

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.136
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.336
and make growth of one month in math

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.600
and two months in reading.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.696
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.360
they now go back four months ahead in math
