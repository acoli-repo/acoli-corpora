00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.736
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.080
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
I was no different.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.336
I'm the second-oldest of seven,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.776
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.000
in Queens, New York.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.656
By virtue of growing up low-income,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.016
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.560
most struggling public schools.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
because I didn't feel like going to class.
