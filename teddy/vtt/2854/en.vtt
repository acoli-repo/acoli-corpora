Getting a college education

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:05.480
is a 20-year investment.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.055
When you're growing up poor,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.016
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.376
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.256
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.416
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.080
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.816
It wasn't until I was a teenager

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.320
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.
