In a typical middle class
or affluent household,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.256
if a kid is struggling,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.216
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.176
even if they don't ask for help.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.336
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.600
and doesn't ask for help,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.560
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.536
So seven years ago,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.376
I started to reform
our public education system

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.720
shaped by my firsthand perspective.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.532
And I started with summer school.
