00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.676
and so we didn't,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.517
to a period that I call
Cool War, cyber war,

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.592
where the costs of conflict are actually
so low, that we may never stop.

00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:12.863
We may enter a period of constant warfare,

00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:17.298
and we know this because
we've been in it for several years.

00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:22.873
And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines
to guide us in this regard.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.346
We don't have the basic ideas formulated.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.910
If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:31.049
do have the ability to respond
with a kinetic attack?
