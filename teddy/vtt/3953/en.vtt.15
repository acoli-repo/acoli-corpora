WEBVTT

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:31.075
is going to be part of a man-made
system for the first time,

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:33.140
able to touch anyone else --

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:35.526
touch them for good, touch them for ill.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:41.825
And the changes associated with that
are changing the very nature

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.450
of every aspect of governance
and life on the planet

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:48.920
in ways that our leaders
ought to be thinking about,

00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:51.424
when they're thinking about
these immediate threats.

00:07:51.824 --> 00:07:53.590
On the security side,

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:59.118
we've come out of a Cold War in which
it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,

00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.676
and so we didn't,
