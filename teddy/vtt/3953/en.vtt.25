00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.651
We are trying to determine

00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:36.964
how much we want to give
in a negotiation with the Iranians

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:41.787
on a nuclear deal which deals
with the technologies of 50 years ago,

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:47.169
when in fact, we know that the Iranians
right now are engaged in cyber war with us

00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:53.227
and we're ignoring it, partially
because businesses are not willing

00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:56.369
to talk about the attacks
that are being waged on them.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.208
And that gets us to another breakdown
