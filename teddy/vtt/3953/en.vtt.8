00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.558
There are political food fights.

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:04.145
We've turned our discourse
into a cage match.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.451
And that's true.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.453
But there are bigger problems,
believe it or not, than that dysfunction,

00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:11.345
even though I would argue

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:16.020
that dysfunction that makes it impossible
to get anything done

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.725
in the richest and most powerful
country in the world

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:25.398
is far more dangerous than anything
that a group like ISIS could do,

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:29.046
because it stops us in our tracks
and it keeps us from progress.
