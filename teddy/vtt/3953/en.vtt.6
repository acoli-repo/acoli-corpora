00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:02.241
And therefore,
for the first time in history,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.213
we were seeing everybody as a threat.

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:07.089
And what was the result of that?

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:11.121
Surveillance programs that listened in
on the emails and phone calls

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:13.310
of entire countries --

00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:15.740
hundreds of millions of people --

00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:18.787
setting aside whether
those countries were our allies,

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.259
setting aside what our interests were.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.013
I would argue that 15 years later,

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:28.430
since today there are more terrorists,

00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:31.996
more terrorist attacks,
more terrorist casualties --
