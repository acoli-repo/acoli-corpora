00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:31.607
We are seeing the advent of mobile money.

00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:33.928
It's happening in the places
you wouldn't expect.

00:11:33.952 --> 00:11:36.329
It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:39.622
where millions of people who haven't
had access to financial services

00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:42.141
now conduct all those
services on their phones.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:47.202
There are 2.5 million people
who don't have financial service access

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:49.242
that are going to get it soon.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.553
A billion of them are going
to have the ability to access it

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.772
on their cell phone soon.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.649
It's not just going to give them
the ability to bank.

00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:59.834
It's going to change
what monetary policy is.

00:11:59.858 --> 00:12:02.494
It's going to change what money is.
