It's Saudi Arabia,
it's Singapore, it's Brazil.

00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:06.346
After the NSA scandal, the Russians,
the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.425
they said, let's create
a new Internet backbone,

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.931
because we can't be dependent
on this other one.

00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:13.924
And so all of a sudden, what do you have?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.899
You have a new bipolar world

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:19.114
in which cyber-internationalism,

00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:20.289
our belief,

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:23.150
is challenged by cyber-nationalism,

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:24.439
another belief.

00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:28.764
We are seeing these changes
everywhere we look.

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:31.607
We are seeing the advent of mobile money.
