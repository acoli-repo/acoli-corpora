more terrorist attacks,
more terrorist casualties --

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.360
this by the count
of the U.S. State Department --

00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:38.453
since today the region
from which those attacks emanate

00:03:38.477 --> 00:03:42.166
is more unstable
than at any time in its history,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.870
since the Flood, perhaps,

00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:49.657
we have not succeeded in our response.

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.213
Now you have to ask,
where did we go wrong?

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.687
What did we do?
What was the mistake that was made?

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.840
And you might say, well look,
Washington is a dysfunctional place.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.558
There are political food fights.
