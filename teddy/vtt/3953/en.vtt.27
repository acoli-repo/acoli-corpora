00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:30.678
it was radar and the Internet.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:33.413
It was Tang, the breakfast drink --

00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:36.314
probably not the most important
of those developments.

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:39.674
But what you had was
a partnership and a dialogue,

00:13:39.698 --> 00:13:41.963
and the dialogue has broken down.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.366
It's broken down because in Washington,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.156
less government is considered more.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.659
It's broken down because there is,
believe it or not,

00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:50.523
in Washington, a war on science --

00:13:50.547 --> 00:13:53.586
despite the fact that
in all of human history,

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.570
every time anyone has waged
a war on science,

00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:58.195
science has won.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:04.390
