00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.085
that global thermonuclear war
was something to be concerned with.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.270
And yet, despite the fact
that we lived for 50 years

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.657
with the threat of such a war,

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:13.662
the response of our government
and of our society

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:15.566
was to do wonderful things.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.218
We created the space program
in response to that.

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:22.339
We built our highway system
in response to that.

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:25.910
We created the Internet
in response to that.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:30.127
So sometimes fear can produce
a constructive response.
