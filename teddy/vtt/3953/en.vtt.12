posed by these terrorists;

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:04.477

than the instability that we've got

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:08.752
in some areas of the world
that are racked by instability today.

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:13.821
In fact, the things that we are seeing
in those parts of the world

00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:16.459
may be symptoms.

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:20.361
They may be a reaction to bigger trends.

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:25.089
And if we are treating the symptom
and ignoring the bigger trend,

00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:28.177
then we've got far bigger
problems to deal with.

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:30.912
And so what are those trends?
