So sometimes fear can produce
a constructive response.

00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:34.169
But sometimes it can produce
an un-constructive response.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.975
On September 11, 2001,

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.510
19 guys took over four airplanes

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.822
and flew them into a couple of buildings.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.127
They exacted a horrible toll.

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:52.151
It is not for us to minimize
what that toll was.

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:59.948
But the response that we had
was clearly disproportionate --

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:04.850
disproportionate to the point
of verging on the unhinged.
