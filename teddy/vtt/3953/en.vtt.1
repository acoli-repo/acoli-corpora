(Applause)

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.726
Thank you.

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:39.639
But I also grew up in a time
where there was something to fear.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.176
We were brought out in the hall
when I was a little kid

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.650
and taught how to put
our coats over our heads

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:51.427
to protect us from global
thermonuclear war.

00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:56.066
Now even my seven-year-old brain
knew that wasn't going to work.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.337
But I also knew

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.085
that global thermonuclear war
was something to be concerned with.
