00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:31.567
about the things that are going
to change the world of tomorrow,"

00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:32.742
you'd get a blank stare.

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:34.687
I know, because when I wrote this book,

00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:37.751
I talked to 150 people,
many from the science and tech side,

00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:40.831
who felt like they were being
shunted off to the kids' table.

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:43.471
Meanwhile, on the tech side,

00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:47.300
we have lots of wonderful people
creating wonderful things,

00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:50.281
but they started in garages
and they didn't need the government

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.978
and they don't want the government.

00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:54.769
Many of them have a political view
that's somewhere between

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.687
libertarian and anarchic:

00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:58.072
leave me alone.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.119
But the world's coming apart.
