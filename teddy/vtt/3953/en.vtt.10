00:04:55.153 --> 00:05:00.382
Because we are reactive to the heightened
venom of the political debate,

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.516
you get governments that have
an us-versus-them mentality,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.937
tiny groups of people making decisions.

00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:09.243
When you sit in a room with a small group
of people making decisions,

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.426
what do you get?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.090
You get groupthink.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:13.703
Everybody has the same worldview,

00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:16.993
and any view from outside of the group
is seen as a threat.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.596
That's a danger.

00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:23.519
You also have processes
that become reactive to news cycles.

00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:27.836
And so the parts of the U.S. government
that do foresight, that look forward,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.015
that do strategy --

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.802
the parts in other governments
that do this -- can't do it,
