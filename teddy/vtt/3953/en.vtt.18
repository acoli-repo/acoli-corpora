Special forces operators
out there in the field today

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.371
discover that small groups
of insurgents with cell phones

00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:11.666
have access to satellite imagery
that once only superpowers had.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.857
In fact, if you've got a cell phone,

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.197
you've got access to power
that a superpower didn't have,

00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:19.376
and would have highly
classified 10 years ago.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.291
In my cell phone,
I have an app that tells me

00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:26.855
where every plane in the world is,
and its altitude, and its speed,

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:28.701
and what kind of aircraft it is,

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:31.641
and where it's going
and where it's landing.
