00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.119
But the world's coming apart.

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:05.057
All of a sudden, there are going to be
massive regulatory changes

00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:07.999
and massive issues
associated with conflict

00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:12.308
and massive issues associated
with security and privacy.

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:14.827
And we haven't even gotten
to the next set of issues,

00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.815
which are philosophical issues.

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:20.423
If you can't vote,
if you can't have a job,

00:15:20.447 --> 00:15:22.939
if you can't bank,
if you can't get health care,

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.405
if you can't be educated
without Internet access,

00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:30.340
is Internet access a fundamental right
that should be written into constitutions?
