00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.643
What I'd like to do
is talk to you a little bit about fear

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.356
and the cost of fear

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.654
and the age of fear
from which we are now emerging.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.047
I would like you to feel comfortable
with my doing that

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:19.364
by letting you know that I know something
about fear and anxiety.

00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:21.575
I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.083
(Laughter)

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:25.975
I could worry before I could walk.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.505
(Laughter)

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.971
Please, applaud that.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.383
(Applause)
