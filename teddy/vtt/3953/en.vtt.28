00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:04.390
(Applause)

00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:08.908
But we have a government
that doesn't want to listen,

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.091
that doesn't have people
at the highest levels

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:12.269
that understand this.

00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:13.444
In the nuclear age,

00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:16.635
when there were people
in senior national security jobs,

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:19.687
they were expected to speak throw-weight.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:23.023
They were expected to know
the lingo, the vocabulary.

00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:25.846
If you went to the highest level
of the U.S. government now

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.403
and said, "Talk to me about cyber,
about neuroscience,

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:31.567
about the things that are going
to change the world of tomorrow,"
