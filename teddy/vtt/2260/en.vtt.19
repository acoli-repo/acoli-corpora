00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:32.934
we're in relationship with the world
in a way that makes sense,

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.643
no one's trying to change us

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:37.268
or shame us or judge us.

00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:38.559
Right?

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:40.101
And attunement takes skill.

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:41.851
When the stakes are high,

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:47.559
let me tell you, it's very hard
to want to attune with anything,

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:50.601
when we're facing such urgent threats.

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:53.309
But the paradox of the moment we're in

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:58.184
is that when we are more in tune
in our window of tolerance,

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:02.101
we are so much more capable
of solving problems,
