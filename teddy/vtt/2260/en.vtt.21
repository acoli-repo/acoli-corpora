"OK, Renee, this sounds awesome
for a clinical context,

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.768
we don't have time for this."

00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:35.018
And that is absolutely not true.

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:37.934
Because we can bring attunement

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:43.309
into every aspect
of our work on this issue.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.375
And it starts with ourselves.

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:51.059
You actually can't do attunement
unless you're in touch with yourself,

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.726
I'm sorry to break it to you.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.101
There's no way around it.

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:56.018
It's from the inside out.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:11:01.101
And so it starts with actually
tuning in to "how am I feeling?"
