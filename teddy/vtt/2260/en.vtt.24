showing up as human, as real,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.518
saying, "You know what?

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.958
I am really scared.

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:10.851
I don't know what all the answers are."

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.268
Can you imagine leaders saying that?

00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:14.542
"I don't know.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.226
But here we are, and we're all needed.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.559
And we're in this together.

00:12:20.583 --> 00:12:22.143
And we can do this."

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:25.643
That's a very different message
than just, "We can do this," right.

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.184
It's like, "Here we are.

00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:30.726
I'm scared, but this is happening."
