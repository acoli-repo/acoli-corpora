00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.476
or the international conferences,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.184
where everyone is asking:

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:36.184
Why aren't we acting faster,
and what's it going to take?

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.934
And so this has become
my mission of sorts,

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.851
which is that I take insights
from psychology

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:46.143
and I translate them
into resources and tools

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:50.601
to support those working on the frontlines
to turn things around.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.518
And that means for anyone, by the way.

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.851
We're all on the frontlines right now.

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.143
And it's my belief,

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.684
after years of straddling these worlds

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.309
between environment and
climate and psychology,
