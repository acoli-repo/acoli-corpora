00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:32.893
People tell me at some point
in the conversation,

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:35.059
"I care very deeply
about what's happening,

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:37.434
I'm incredibly freaked out.

Really scared of any change, it's so --

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.976
I can't even think about it,
it's like, unthinkable."
