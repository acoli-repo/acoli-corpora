00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.768
is how do we stay present

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.809
with what's really painful,

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.893
how do we stay connected

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:11.958
in the face of what's threatening
and overwhelming and scary?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.684
And it turns out that psychology
knows a lot about these things.

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.625
Truly, a lot.

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:22.809
But I wasn't hearing any of this
being referenced

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.309
in my environmental studies class,

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.309
or the climate action meetings
I started going to,

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.476
or the international conferences,
