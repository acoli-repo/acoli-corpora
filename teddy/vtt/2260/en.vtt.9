00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.726
And the first is something
called our window of tolerance.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.184
So Dr. Dan Siegel has described
us all as having a window.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.601
How much stress can we tolerate

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.268
while staying connected

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:43.726
and what clinicians
would call "integrated."

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.809
Integrated, where we can actually

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.893
be in touch with our thoughts and feelings

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.292
and not just get kind of co-opted.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.184
And we all have a threshold.

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:56.143
And what happens when we experience stress

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.684
beyond what we can tolerate?

00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:02.559
We tend to go into the edges
of our window.
