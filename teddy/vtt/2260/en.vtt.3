things are not normal anymore.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:36.059
And I was anxious, I was terrified,

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.559
no one was talking about this,

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.542
and I almost dropped out
of school, for real.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:47.434
But instead, I signed up
for a field study in California,

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:52.393
and we were backpacking together
as a small group for two months,

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.143
which I know sounds very intense.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:02:00.059
And it was, but what I found
is that we talked a lot.
