00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.143
What if by understanding ourselves

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.809
and one another,

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:34.226
we could find our way through this crisis

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.309
in a new and different way?

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.434
You know, what if psychology actually held

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.101
a missing key to unlocking action

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:45.184
on the greatest challenges
facing our planet right now?

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.143
So when I got back from the field study,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.518
I focused on clinical psychology,

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.518
and I researched the relationships

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:56.934
between trauma and grief and creativity.

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.893
And the paradox at the heart of,
I think, all of this

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.768
is how do we stay present
