it looks like people don't care,
it looks like apathy.

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.559
And so a lot of folks who are seeing
the urgency of the situation

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:40.309

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.934
We've got to get you psyched."

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.976
And we become cheerleaders for solutions.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.667
Or like, "Here's the facts,
this is happening, wake up."

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:54.976

are actually not inherently bad,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.518
because we need solutions
and we need to face the facts.

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:02.684
But inadvertently, this can backfire
