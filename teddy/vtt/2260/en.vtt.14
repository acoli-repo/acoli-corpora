00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.976
I can't even think about it,
it's like, unthinkable."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.559
And this is the second concept,

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.476
which is something called a double bind.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.976
And a double bind is when we feel
sort of like, damned if you do,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.559
and damned if you don't,

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.143
and you're just kind of stuck there.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.684
It's a very intolerable human experience.

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:21.417
And we will do anything we can
to get rid of it and just push it away.

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.143
And so all that care and concern,

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:28.601
it's there, it just goes down,
it goes underground.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:29.934
But what happens is,

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.851
it looks like people don't care,
it looks like apathy.
