00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:32.059
and the therapist starts shouting at you

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:34.976
and saying, "Don’t you see
what's happening?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.601
If you don't act now,

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.393
you're going to face
terrifying consequences.

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:41.184
Don’t you care?

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.601
What's wrong with you?

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.851
What's it going to take?"

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:48.268
Or you see a therapist
and you're feeling actually sad

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:50.184
and grief.

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:51.559
And this therapist says,

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.976
"You know, don't think about it too much.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.434
Here's some simple things you can do.

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:57.726
Simple positive things."

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.375
And sends you on your way.
