00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.309
between environment and
climate and psychology,

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:05.268
that this actually is
a missing ingredient in our work

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:10.143
that can exponentially accelerate
our capacities to be creative

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.768
and resilient and capable
and skillful and courageous

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:17.167
and all those things that the world
is needing from us right now.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.768
So I'm going to share
three concepts with you

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.809
that I found particularly game-changing

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:25.726
and how I make sense of this moment

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.476
for us as humans.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.726
And the first is something
called our window of tolerance.
