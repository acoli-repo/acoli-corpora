00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.684
all those things that we want to be.

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:33.059
And this is totally normal,

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:37.101
but it's happening
all around the world right now, right?

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:41.143
We're all vacillating between
these different feelings and emotions.

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:43.851
And so with something like climate change,

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:47.351
with every new scientific report,

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.351
documentary,

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.643
connecting the dots between,
you know, what we're doing

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.184
and the impact it's having,

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:58.101
it can collectively be pushing us
outside of our window of tolerance.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.434
And we lose that capacity, right?
