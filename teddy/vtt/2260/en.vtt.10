00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:02.559
We tend to go into the edges
of our window.

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.101
And on one hand,

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.684
we might go into a sort of collapse,

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.976
what's called a chaotic response,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.143
which looks like depression, despair,

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.768
kind of a shutting down.

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:18.268
And on the other side of this window
is a more rigid response:

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:19.726
denial,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.101
anger,

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.500
rigid.

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.601
And so when that happens,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.309
we actually lose our capacity
to be integrated,

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.684
resilient, adaptive,

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.684
all those things that we want to be.
