00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:01.059
But if you don't know that,

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:02.518
if you don't hold on to that,

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:05.559
if you can't support that
with data, which we can,

00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.934
you will be drawn
into the narrative of fear

00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.934
that will lead us to justify

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.184
the kinds of horrors we have inflicted

00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:14.643
upon communities of color
and low-income communities

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:17.477
and people that become
ensnared in our criminal legal system

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:18.768
for far too long.

00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:20.059
So get educated --

00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:24.768
(Applause)

00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:27.268
Get educated, proximate, stay vigilant,

00:16:27.292 --> 00:16:29.393
do not be drawn
into the narratives of fear,

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:32.684
which are wildly and grossly
racialized anyway.
