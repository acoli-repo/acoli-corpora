WEBVTT

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.893
at different locations across the country,

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:32.226
they have to take our model

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.226
and adapt it to the unique needs
of each jurisdiction.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.476
And that's where it becomes complex,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.226
and it's very resource intensive,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.768
because criminal justice
is incredibly local,

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:46.351
and so how each system operates is unique.

00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:48.226
And what the needs of our clients are

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.018
are incredibly different
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:52.518
So you can be in Oklahoma

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:56.184
and what you know is that communities
have been ravaged by the opioid crisis,

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:57.934
and when we're bringing people home,

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.768
we have to connect them to services
that might address that.
