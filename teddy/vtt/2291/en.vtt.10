Make sure they're connected
to services they might need.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.393
And people will come back to court
while their cases are open,

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:05.976
and until those cases close.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.893
It is in an effort to move policy forward,

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:12.101
to ensure the systemic change happens,

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.393
but here's our fear:

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:14.976
it's a race against time.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.226
Because as this conversation
picks up speed,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.726
and as bail reform begins to take hold,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.559
some systems will move to new systems

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.809
that we fear will recreate
some of the same harms, right,

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.934
that the initial bail system [created].

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.351
Those are racial disparities,
