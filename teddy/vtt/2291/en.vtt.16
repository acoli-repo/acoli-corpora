00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.393
Has there been some opposition?

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:02.018
Sure, of course.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.851
You know, when we go into a new site,

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.184
we do so carefully,
we prospect it carefully,

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.851
we try to understand
who are our partners on the ground

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.726
that might help us in this initiative,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.184
grassroots organizers,
not-for-profit organizations,

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.809
systems holders, sheriffs, right?

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.059
Who is going to support us
and who our opposition might be.

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.976
MZ: You also put some of the people
that you bail out,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.934
you bring them back, right,
as program officers.

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.393
Is that part of the system

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:30.851
that you're trying to make a community
around your efforts in some way?
