00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.351
Those are racial disparities,

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:31.851
economic inequality,

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:35.059
and we can actually recreate that
if we don't get this right.

00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:36.768
And so we're in a race against time

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:40.059
to prove that you can do
a community-based model

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.018
that doesn't require electronic monitoring

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:46.726
or risk algorithms
or jail cells or cash bail,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.268
but that you can simply release people
to communities with supports.

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:51.559
And that will work.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.768
MZ: I want to come back to that
in a minute, but before we do that,

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.643
my background is as a tech journalist,

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:59.143
and when you talk about
scaling a program like this,

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.476
I can only assume that you are facing
completely different challenges
