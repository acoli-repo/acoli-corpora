00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.101
in some of these places?

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:32.809
RS: So I think it depends
on the definition of community.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.226
So communities that have been targeted
by our criminal legal system

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.518
for generations,

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:39.684
communities of color,
low-income communities,

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:42.351
marginalized communities,
women across the country,

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:44.934
they are more than happy to see us come,

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.059
because we are just an immediate lifeline.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:50.143
Bail funds are a tool to get people out
as an immediate lifeline,

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:52.851
it's not a long-term,
systemic answer, right?

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.643
But people are, of course,

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.976
they want to get out,
go back to their families,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.851
their communities want them home.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.393
Has there been some opposition?
