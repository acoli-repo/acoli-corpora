00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:01.768
some changes in that process

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:05.934
that placed, you know, pretrial services
in the hands of law enforcement,

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.226
that put people through risk algorithms,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.101
that sort of had a lot
of the telltale signs of a system

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:15.768
that was going to recreate the same
racial inequity and economic inequalities

00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:17.059
that we had always seen,

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.851
and so, that bill actually
moved through the process,

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.768
and we thought that was the end.

00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:26.476
But then the bail bond industry
actually got 400,000 signatures

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.768
to put it on the ballot.

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:29.851
So in November,
Californians will be voting

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.434
on whether or not SB 10
should go forward or not.
