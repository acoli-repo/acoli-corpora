So it's the damage to you
that's happening in our local jails,

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.309
but it's also what's happening
to you and your family

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.684
and your community
that you've been removed from

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:09.476
while you're waiting for your trial,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.101
which, by the way, can take days, weeks
and no exaggeration, can take years.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.976
MZ: So you explained this sort of
crazy limbo that people are in

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.934
from the TED stage in 2018,

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.059
and I want to just play a quick clip
from that talk that you gave,

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.684
which was incredibly moving.

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:26.143
Can we play that?

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:29.143
(Audio: Robin Steinberg TED2018)
It's time to do something big.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.934
It's time to do something bold.
