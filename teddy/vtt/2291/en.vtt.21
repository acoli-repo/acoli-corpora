on whether or not SB 10
should go forward or not.

00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:36.434
MZ: So Californians in the audience,

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:38.393
How should they vote?

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:41.934
RS: So I'm not so bold as to say that.

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.476
I may be audacious,
but I'm not that audacious.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.726
But what I will say is,
educate yourselves.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.893
Understand what you're voting on.

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:51.893
Understand what it means
to hold somebody in jail

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.684
who hasn't been convicted of a crime

00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:56.393
simply for their poverty, right?

00:10:56.417 --> 00:11:00.476
And ask yourselves, do we want to have
a criminal legal system
