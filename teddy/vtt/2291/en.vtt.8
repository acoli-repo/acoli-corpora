00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:01.434
which is TED's initiative to get
some of these big ideas support

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:03.559
to make them actually happen.

00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:06.643
Can you explain what has happened
since you gave your talk?

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:07.934
RS: Sure.

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.601
So, the Audacious grant allowed us

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.351
to take our proven concept
and to scale it.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:16.559
And the idea is that we are scaling
this model across the country.

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:19.643
We're currently in 18 different sites.

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:22.393
And we are doing two things, right?

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:24.601
The Bail Project is designed both,

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:27.851
provide an immediate lifeline
for folks that are stuck in jail cells

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.184
simply because of poverty,

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.059
because they can't pay their bail,
