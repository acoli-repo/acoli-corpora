Manoush Zomorodi: So, Robin Steinberg,

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:05.559
thank you so much
for being my first official guest

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.018
as the new host of TED Radio Hour.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.518
I'm pretty psyched about that.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.019
Robin Steinberg: I'm delighted.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.059
(Applause)

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:15.143
MZ: So OK, I want to start
with the Bail Project,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:18.268
how it came to be,
how you came up with the idea.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:19.559
The story goes

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:23.684
that 10 years ago, you and your husband
were eating Chinese takeout food

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.476
when you came up with the concept.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.934
You'd been a public defender
for over 30 years,

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.226
but there was this moment
where you decided something had to change.
