(Applause)

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.643
You've got some of the smartest
women in the world here,

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.018
surrounding you.

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:41.309
They're energized,

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:43.476
they want to know
what to do with that energy

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.393
when they go back to their communities.

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:49.601
And actually I know you took some of them
to see a local jail yesterday, right?

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:50.893
RS: I did.

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.434
MZ: Can you tell us about that?

00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:54.476
RS: So, here's what we need to understand.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.309
This problem is all of our problems.

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.393
Each and every one of us is implicated

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:01.559
in what our criminal
legal system looks like.
