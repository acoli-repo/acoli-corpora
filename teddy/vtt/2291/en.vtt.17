that you're trying to make a community
around your efforts in some way?

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.809
RS: So when we're hiring
for local jurisdictions,

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:35.143
we always hire locally.

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:36.809
If we open a site in Baton Rouge,

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:40.059
we hire people from Baton Rouge
and are connected to the community.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.434
We try to prioritize people
with lived experience

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.893
in the criminal legal system,

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.684
or people who have been
personally impacted by the system.

00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:49.393
We think it's important,
they understand the system best,

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:52.684
they have the best solutions
because they're closest to the problem

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:54.934
and they're credible
messengers for the clients

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.768
that we're going to be interviewing
and providing bail for.

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.101
MZ: So you touched on this,

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.351
criminal justice reform
has become a hot topic,
