00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:00.351
And that was whether or not
your client could pay bail

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.309
and fight her case from freedom

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.476
or whether she was going to be
locked in jail on Rikers Island

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.601
and desperate would wind up
pleading guilty,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.393
whether she did it or not.

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:12.143
And that just enraged us.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.143
And sometimes, you know,

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.851
the answers are simple
and they're right in front of you.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.143
And so we thought,

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.518
"Well, what if we just paid
clients' bail?"

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.476
And that's where the idea
of creating a revolving bail fund --

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.643
because bail comes back
at the end of a case,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:27.809
if we could raise money
and put it in a fund,

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.559
and have a revolving fund,

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.893
we could just pay bail for our clients.
