00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:38.851
in the trenches of the criminal

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.684
defending people's humanity
and their dignity

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.476

and how forceful we fought
on behalf of a client,

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.434
sometimes it all came down

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:00.351
