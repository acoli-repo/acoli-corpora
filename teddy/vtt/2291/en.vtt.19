00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.726
We have to eliminate
unaffordable cash bail forever.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.018
We know money isn't
what makes people come back,

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:35.643
it's a myth, let's get rid of it.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:38.559
But the question about what comes next
is very, very complex,

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:40.226
and California was a good example.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.476
There was a bill that worked its way
through the political process,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.768
called SB 10.

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.745
It started out as what looked like a bill

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:49.476
that would actually move
towards more decarceration.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.786
By the time it came out
of the political process,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.393
frankly it was a bill that almost nobody
in the community would support,

00:09:55.417 --> 00:09:57.184
including the Bail Project.

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:59.851
And it had gone through

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:01.768
some changes in that process
