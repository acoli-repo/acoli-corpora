WEBVTT

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.768
we have to connect them to services
that might address that.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:02.059
When you're in Spokane,

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:04.376
you're talking about an epidemic
of homelessness.

00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.217
So when you're thinking about providing
direct services and bringing people home,

00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:11.059
you have to be mindful of the fact
that in that jurisdiction

00:07:11.084 --> 00:07:13.143
that may be the biggest
obstacle for people,

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.726
is that they don't have shelter.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.851
And so we need to adapt our model
in every jurisdiction we go to

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.768
to address the needs of that community.

00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:22.316
MZ: I could only assume
that some of these communities

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.101
are not so happy that you're there.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.268
That must be a reality of it.

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.726
Do you have to win
hearts and minds as well,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.101
in some of these places?
