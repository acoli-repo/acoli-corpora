criminal justice reform
has become a hot topic,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:04.601
you must be like, "Yay, finally
people are talking about this thing

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.809
that I've been banging on
about for decades."

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:11.101
Here in California actually,
though, there has been a big change.

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:12.518
Now it's complicated,

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:15.851
but my understanding is
that they're getting rid of cash bail.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.893
Good thing, bad thing,
not quite that simple to explain?

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:21.268
RS: So everything
about criminal justice reform,

00:09:21.292 --> 00:09:22.726
and particularly bail reform,

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.703
is way more complex than it looks, right?

00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:27.934
So it's easy to have a hashtag
that says "end cash bail."

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.226
Totally right.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.726
We have to eliminate
unaffordable cash bail forever.
