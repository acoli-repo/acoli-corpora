MZ: Can you clarify, though,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:05.601
like, why it is so important
for someone not to be in jail

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.434
while they await trial?

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:10.316
You've explained this in the past
and it really blew my mind,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.518
because I had no idea what could happen
in those days or weeks

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:16.809
before someone actually
has to plead their case.

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.768
RS: Sure. So, being held in jail
even for a few days

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.809
can change the trajectory of your life.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.851
It is not only the place
where you can be victimized, sexually,

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.601
you can be exposed to violence,

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.226
you'll be traumatized in all sorts of ways
while you're in the jail,
