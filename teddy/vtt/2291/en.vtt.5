00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.226
you'll be traumatized in all sorts of ways
while you're in the jail,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.393
and that's even
the first few days or a week

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:36.934
is when most jail deaths actually,
whether they're suicides or homicides,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.226
actually happen.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.851
But while you're sitting in jail,

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.226
and understand,
folks sitting in jail pretrial

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.351
have not been convicted of a crime.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:47.393
They're there because they don't have
enough money to pay bail.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.018
And while that's happening,
people's lives are falling apart outside.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.518
You're losing your job,

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.018
you might be losing your home,

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:55.893
your children might be taken from you,

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.059
your immigration status
might be jeopardized,

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.809
you might get thrown out of school.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.768
So it's the damage to you
that's happening in our local jails,
