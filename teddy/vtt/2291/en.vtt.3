00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.893
we could just pay bail for our clients.

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.458
Now I have to say, that was back in 2005.

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.976
People weren’t talking
about criminal justice reform

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.268
the way they are now,

00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:41.809
there wasn't a lot of conversation
about bail reform,

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.893
and quite honestly, we spent two years
knocking on people's door.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:58.059
And we began to test
the revolving bail fund model.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.934
And to see what would happen.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.434
MZ: Can you clarify, though,
