00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.934
It's time to do something bold.

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.143
It's time to do something ...
maybe audacious?

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.643
(Laughter)

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:38.851
We want to take our proven
revolving bail-fund model

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.268
that we built in the Bronx

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:42.184
and spread it across America,

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.309
attacking the front-end
of the legal system

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.184
before incarceration begins.

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:48.143
(Applause)

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:52.393
MZ: The energy in the room
when you gave your talk was palpable,

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:55.768
and it ended up getting you
quite a bit of funding

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:57.143
from the Audacious Project,

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:01.434
which is TED's initiative to get
some of these big ideas support
