00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:01.143
if you don't actually see it
with your eyes.

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:03.268
It was shocking.

00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:05.934
And I saw it on the faces
of the people that I was with.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.851
So we have to know that's what we're doing
in the name of justice in this country

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.434
and stand up against it.

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:13.363
But the only way you're going to do that

00:15:13.387 --> 00:15:17.934
is if you fight back the narrative
of fear that enables that to happen.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.268
And what do I mean by that?

00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:22.102
I promise you, every single time
you get into a conversation

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:24.226
about bail reform
or criminal justice reform,

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.518
here's what happens:

00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:27.726
everybody starts talking
about the scary case.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.518
"But what about the guy who did X?"
