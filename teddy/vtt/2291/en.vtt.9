00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.059
because they can't pay their bail,

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:35.184
and that's a response
to the immediate direct emergency

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.684
and human rights crisis
that we have in this country

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.226
around pretrial incarceration.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.268
But the second thing we're trying to do
is we're testing a model

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:44.893
that we call community release
with voluntary supports.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.601
And what we're trying to prove is,

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:47.976
A: you don't need cash bail,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.286
people will come back to court
without cash bail.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.809
That myth has already been debunked
and we know that.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.268
But we're also trying to model

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:56.976
you can actually release people
back to their communities

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.684
with effective court notifications.

00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:01.393
Make sure they're connected
to services they might need.
