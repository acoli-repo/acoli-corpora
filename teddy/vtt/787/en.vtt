00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:06.976
I got to see the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:10.103
I was in India this past year,

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:14.014
and I may have seen
the last cases of polio in the world.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.416
There's nothing that makes
you feel more --

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.983
the blessing and the honor
of working in a program like that --

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.051
than to know that something
that horrible no longer exists.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.728
So I'm going to tell you --

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:31.457
