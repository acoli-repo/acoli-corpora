00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:04.873
I would like to talk to you
about why many ehealth projects fail.

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:07.618
And I really think
that the most important thing of it

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.976
is that we stopped listening to patients.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.617
And one thing we did at Radboud University

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.652
is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:16.283
Not in a very scientific way --

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.668
she puts up a little cup
of coffee or a cup of tea

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:22.335
and asks patients, family, relatives,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.522
"What's up?

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.053
How could we help you?"

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.107
And we think, we like to think,

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.960
that this is one of the major problems

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:31.112
why all -- maybe not all --
