00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:11.454
Two frogs are minding their own business
in the swamp when WHAM—

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:13.288
they’re kidnapped.

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:17.246
They come to in a kitchen, 
captives of a menacing chef.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.454
He boils up a pot of water 
and lobs one of the frogs in.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.454
But it’s having none of this.

00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:28.288
The second its toes hit the scalding water
it jumps right out the window.

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:33.454
The chef refills the pot, but this time 
he doesn’t turn on the heat.
