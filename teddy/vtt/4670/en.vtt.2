Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example.

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.837
Their one job is to break down cellulose,

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:08.567
a common compound in vegetables, into sugars.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.690
Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.955
another set of microbes that snatch up

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.347
these simple sugars and burn them as fuel.

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:19.813
As food travels through our digestive tract,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:23.716
it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.247
by converting them into chemicals,

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:27.446
like alcohol and hydrogen gas,

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.512
which they spew out as waste products.
