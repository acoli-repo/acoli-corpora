00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:33.080
Each is a different habitat for microbial communities:

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.319
from the arid deserts of our skin,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.106
to the villages on our lips,

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:39.978
and the cities in our mouths.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:44.696
Even every tooth is its own distinctive neighborhood,

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:50.326
and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting microbes.

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:52.866
And in these bustling streets of our guts,

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.306
we see a constant influx of food,

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.111
and every microbe has a job to do.

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:01.947
Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example.
