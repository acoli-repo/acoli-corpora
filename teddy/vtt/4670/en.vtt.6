but it is likely that lifestyle changes,

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.704
such as eating a varied diet of complex, plant-based foods,

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:07.874
can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in our gut

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:10.813
and across the entire landscape of our body.

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:13.291
So, we are really not alone in our body.

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:17.126
Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes,

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:20.957
and we need them just as much as they need us.

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:23.048
As we learn more about how our microbes

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.319
interact with each other and with our bodies,

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.546
we will reveal how we can nurture

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:29.294
this complex, invisible world

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:31.176
that shapes our personal identity,
