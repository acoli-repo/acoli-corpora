00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:30.858
But, if a food is made of simple molecules,

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:31.951
like a lollipop,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.989
some of these workers are put out of a job.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.005
Those workers leave the city, never to return.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.623
What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities

00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:43.718
with only a few different types of workers.

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:46.406
For example, humans who suffer from diseases

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:49.016
like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.550
typically have less microbial variety in their guts.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.886
We don't fully understand the best way

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:58.100
to manage our individual microbial societies,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.269
but it is likely that lifestyle changes,
