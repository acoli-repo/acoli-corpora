00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:03.113
that another person's gut microbes can extract.

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:07.663
So, what determines the membership of our gut microbial community?

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.661
Well, things like our genetic makeup

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.073
and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives

00:02:13.073 --> 00:02:16.829
can contribute to our microbial ecosystems.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.073
The food we eat also influences

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.275
which microbes live in our gut.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.354
For example, food made of complex molecules,

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:25.213
like an apple,

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:28.751
requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down.

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:30.858
But, if a food is made of simple molecules,
