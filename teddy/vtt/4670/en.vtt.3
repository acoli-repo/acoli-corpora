00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.512
which they spew out as waste products.

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:33.165
Deeper in the depths of our gut city,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:37.518
the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters' trash.

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:39.589
At each step of this process,

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:41.251
energy is released,

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.776
and that energy is absorbed

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:44.492
by the cells of the digestive tract.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:48.169
This city we just saw is different in everyone.

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:52.130
Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.032
that can process food in different ways.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.642
One person's gut microbes may be capable

00:01:57.642 --> 00:01:59.907
of releasing only a fraction of the calories

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:03.113
that another person's gut microbes can extract.
