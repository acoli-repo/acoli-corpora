00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
between phosphate groups.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Laughter)
