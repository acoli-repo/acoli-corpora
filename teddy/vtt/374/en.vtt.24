It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Laughter)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
so I'm still looking happy.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Laughter)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But there is what we did when we didn't know

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He was one of the members. The question was:

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
How do you go from a four-letter code

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to the 20-letter code of proteins?
