00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And so Bragg said, "Build models."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and that they should immediately start building models.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and after she left he would start building models.
