because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so I didn't really get happy until 1960,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
because then we found out, basically, you know,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that there are three forms of RNA.
