00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and he talked about DNA.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Most people believed it was proteins.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and he showed this x-ray photograph.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
even though it owed it to probably different molecules
