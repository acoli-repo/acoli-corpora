00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And there I met Francis Crick.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And within a day, we had decided that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,
