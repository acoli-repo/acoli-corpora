and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I just put them down like they were in the books.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
He said they were wrong.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right."

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And we knew we were right.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
From nothing to thing.
