00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
From nothing to thing.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So we saw how genetic information is carried.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It's the order of the four bases.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And you copy it by going from strand-separating.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,
