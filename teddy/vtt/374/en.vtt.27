00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and it was all over by 1966.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so what happened since then?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, at that time -- I should go back.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk
