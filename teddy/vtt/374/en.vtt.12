because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So we built a three-stranded model.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The people from London came up.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
