When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
