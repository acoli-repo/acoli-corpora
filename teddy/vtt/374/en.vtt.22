So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
because you didn't have any other scheme.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But that's not the way most scientists think.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Most scientists are really rather dull.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So think about it. The next five years,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
there were essentially something like five references

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to our work in "Nature" -- none.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And so we were left by ourselves,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --
