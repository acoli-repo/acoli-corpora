on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and somehow all the information was probably present

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in some digital form. And there was the big question

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of, how did you copy the information?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So that was the book. And so, from that moment on,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I wanted to be a geneticist --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
understand the gene and, through that, understand life.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.
