00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and made a really sort of surprising observation.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
where we've lost a gene or gained another one.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
if we're around here, you know,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
these little losses or gains might not be too bad.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
maybe we'll feel sick.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So the first disease he looked at is autism.
