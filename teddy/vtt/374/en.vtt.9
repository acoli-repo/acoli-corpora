00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
even though it owed it to probably different molecules

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
carrying different sets of instructions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and I ended up in Cambridge, England.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I went to Cambridge,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because it was really the best place in the world then

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in, you know, chemistry departments.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So the best place for x-ray crystallography

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.
