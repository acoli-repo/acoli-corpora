00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And so we were left by ourselves,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
what does this genetic information do?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Laughter)
