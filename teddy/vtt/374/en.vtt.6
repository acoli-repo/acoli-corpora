00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000

So I went to Indiana,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,
