00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And we use their technique.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And you can see on the top

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So the DNA is really badly mucked up,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
whereas if you have a chance of surviving,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the DNA isn't so mucked up.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
you should really look at this technique,
