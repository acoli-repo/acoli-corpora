00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
he banished the man out on the right,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is a photograph several years later,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
when Bragg had cause to smile.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,
