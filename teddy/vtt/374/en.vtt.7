00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
maybe I could become a biochemist,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You can read it in about two hours.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and he talked about DNA.
