00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and after she left he would start building models.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and Bragg said, "Build models."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Well, of course, I wanted to build models.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in one sense she was a chemist,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but really she would have been trained --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
She was a crystallographer.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,
