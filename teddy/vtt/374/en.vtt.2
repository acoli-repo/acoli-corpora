00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or anything like that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Laughter)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And my mother was Irish Catholic,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and going on birdwatching walks with my father.
