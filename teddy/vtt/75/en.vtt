00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:02.714
I'm a meteorologist by degree,

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:05.881
I have a bachelor's,
master's and PhD in physical meteorology,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.041
so I'm a meteorologist, card carrying.

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:13.143
And so with that comes
four questions, always.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.723
This is one prediction
I will always get right.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.603
(Laughter)

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:19.675
And those questions are,

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.183
"Marshall, what channel are you on?"

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:24.024
(Laughter)

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:26.889
"Dr. Shepherd, what's the weather
going to be tomorrow?"

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:27.913
(Laughter)

00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:29.524
And oh, I love this one:

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:32.993
"My daughter is getting married
next September, it's an outdoor wedding.
