00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:01.559
my friends and I bought Super Soakers

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.569
and turned the hotel parking lot
into our own water-filled battle zone.

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:07.805
We hid behind cars,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.973
running through the darkness that
lay between the streetlights,

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:14.384
boundless laughter ubiquitous 
across the pavement.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.467
But within 10 minutes,

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.480
my father came outside, 
grabbed me by my forearm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.505
and led me into our room
with an unfamiliar grip.

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.369
Before I could say anything,

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.727
tell him how foolish he had 
made me look in front of my friends,

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:30.842
he derided me for being so naive.
