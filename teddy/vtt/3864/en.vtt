00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.190
Growing up, I didn't always understand

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.885
why my parents made me
follow the rules that they did.

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:08.675
Like, why did I really 
have to mow the lawn?

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.343
Why was homework really that important?

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:15.267
Why couldn't I put jelly beans 
in my oatmeal?

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:18.123
My childhood was abound
with questions like this.

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:22.396
Normal things about being a kid
and realizing that sometimes,

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:26.479
it was best to listen to my parents
even when I didn't exactly understand why.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:29.495
And it's not that they didn't want
me to think critically.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.096
Their parenting always sought 
to reconcile the tension
