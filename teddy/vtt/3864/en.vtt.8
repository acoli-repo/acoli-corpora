00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.462
Because we have parents
who raised us to understand

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.238
that our bodies weren't meant
for the backside of a bullet,

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:08.872
but for flying kites and jumping rope,
and laughing until our stomachs burst.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:11.856
We had teachers who taught us 
how to raise our hands in class,

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:13.424
and not just to signal surrender,

00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:15.390
and that the only thing we should give up

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.763
is the idea that we 
aren't worthy of this world.

00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:21.043
So when we say that black lives matter,
it's not because others don't,

00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:24.751
it's simply because we must affirm that we
are worthy of existing without fear,

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.877
when so many things tell us we are not.

00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:28.839
I want to live in a world where my son

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.327
will not be presumed guilty
the moment he is born,
