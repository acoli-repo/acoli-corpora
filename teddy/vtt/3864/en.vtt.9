00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.327
will not be presumed guilty
the moment he is born,

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:35.178
where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken
for anything other than a toy.

00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:38.613
And I refuse to accept that we can't
build this world into something new,

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:40.110
some place where a child's name

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.857
doesn't have to be written 
on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,

00:04:42.857 --> 00:04:44.474
where the value of someone's life

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:48.273
isn't determined by anything other 
than the fact that they had lungs,

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:52.491
a place where every single 
one of us can breathe.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:53.445
Thank you.

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.903
