00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.648
These events and all that 
has transpired after them

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:32.756
have brought me back to my own childhood

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:37.100
and the decisions that my parents made
about raising a black boy in America

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.207
that growing up, I didn't always
understand in the way that I do now.

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:46.212
I think of how hard it must have been,
how profoundly unfair it must have felt

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:50.397
for them to feel like they had 
to strip away parts of my childhood

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.210
just so that I could come home at night.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.311
For example, I think of how one night,

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:59.213
when I was around 12 years old, on an
overnight field trip to another city,

00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:01.559
my friends and I bought Super Soakers
