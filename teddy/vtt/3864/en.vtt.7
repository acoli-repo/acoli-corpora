00:03:27.672 --> 00:03:30.402
All of my black friends were raised
with the same message,

00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.679
the talk, given to us 
when we became old enough

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.624
to be mistaken for a nail ready
to be hammered to the ground,

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:40.118
when people made our melanin
synonymous with something to be feared.

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.591
But what does it do to a child

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:46.041
to grow up knowing that you
cannot simply be a child?

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:49.190
That the whims of adolescence
are too dangerous for your breath,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.854
that you cannot simply be curious,

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:53.548
that you are not afforded the luxury
of making a mistake,

00:03:53.548 --> 00:03:55.316
that someone's implicit bias

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:57.826
might be the reason you don't
wake up in the morning.

00:03:58.156 --> 00:03:59.871
But this cannot be what defines us.

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.462
Because we have parents
who raised us to understand
