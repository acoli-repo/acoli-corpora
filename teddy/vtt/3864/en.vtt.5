Looked me in the eye, 
fear consuming his face,

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.930
and said, "Son, I'm sorry,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.967
but you can't act the same 
as your white friends.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.202
You can't pretend to shoot guns.

00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:45.088
You can't run around in the dark.

00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:48.132
You can't hide behind anything
other than your own teeth."

I know now how scared he must have been,

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:55.148
how easily I could have fallen
into the empty of the night,

00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:57.907
that some man would mistake this water

00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.154
for a good reason to wash
all of this away.
