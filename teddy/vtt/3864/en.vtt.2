In his most famous book,
"Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:05.156
he states, "No one can be 
authentically human

00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:07.387
while he prevents others from being so."

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.987
I've been thinking a lot about this 
lately, this idea of humanity,

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:15.264
and specifically, who in this world
is afforded the privilege

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:18.280
of being perceived as fully human.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.610
Over the course of 
the past several months,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.818
the world has watched
as unarmed black men, and women,

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:27.755
have had their lives taken
at the hands of police and vigilante.

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.648
These events and all that 
has transpired after them
