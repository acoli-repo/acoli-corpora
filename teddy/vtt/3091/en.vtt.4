00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.160
So I've always been fascinated
with the hippocampus.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.456
How could it be that an event
that lasts just a moment,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.696
say, your first kiss,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.176
or the moment your first child was born,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.256
can form a memory
that has changed your brain,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.616
that lasts an entire lifetime?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.656
That's what I want to understand.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.776
I wanted to start and record
the activity of individual brain cells

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.416
in the hippocampus

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.616
as subjects were forming new memories.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.936
And essentially try and decode how
those brief bursts of electrical activity,
