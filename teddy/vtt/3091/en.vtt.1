00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.696
I am talking about the powerful effects
of physical activity.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.136
Simply moving your body,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.400
has immediate, long-lasting
and protective benefits for your brain.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.136
And that can last
for the rest of your life.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.536
So what I want to do today
is tell you a story

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.176
about how I used my deep
understanding of neuroscience,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.936
as a professor of neuroscience,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.776
to essentially do an experiment on myself

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.816
in which I discovered
the science underlying

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.696
why exercise
is the most transformative thing
