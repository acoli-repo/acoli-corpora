00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.176
And I came back with a mission.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.856
I said, "I'm never going to feel
like the weakest person

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.376
on a river-rafting trip again."

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.376
And that's what made me go to the gym.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.896
And I focused my type-A personality

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.856
on going to all the exercise
classes at the gym.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.776
I tried everything.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.736
I went to kickbox,
dance, yoga, step class,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.896
and at first it was really hard.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.896
But what I noticed is that after every
sweat-inducing workout that I tried,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.816
I had this great mood boost
and this great energy boost.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.576
And that's what kept me
going back to the gym.
