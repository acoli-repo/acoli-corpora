00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.576
And that's what kept me
going back to the gym.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.176
Well, I started feeling stronger.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.816
I started feeling better,
I even lost that 25 pounds.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.840
And now, fast-forward a year and a half
into this regular exercise program

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.016
and I noticed something that really
made me sit up and take notice.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.016
I was sitting at my desk,
writing a research grant,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.096
and a thought went through my mind

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.776
that had never gone
through my mind before.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.656
And that thought was,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.976
"Gee, grant-writing is going well today."
