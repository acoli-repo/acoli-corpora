00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.976
"Gee, grant-writing is going well today."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.296
And all the scientists --

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.336
(Laughter)

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.936
yeah, all the scientists
always laugh when I say that,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.976
because grant-writing never goes well.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.816
It is so hard; you're always
pulling your hair out,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.096
trying to come up with that
million-dollar-winning idea.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.376
But I realized that
the grant-writing was going well,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.736
because I was able
to focus and maintain my attention

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.776
for longer than I had before.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.776
And my long-term memory --
what I was studying in my own lab --

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.640
seemed to be better in me.
