00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.016
Number two: the most common finding
in neuroscience studies,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.656
looking at effects of long-term exercise,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.056
is improved attention function
dependent on your prefrontal cortex.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.536
You not only get
better focus and attention,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.136
but the volume of the hippocampus
increases as well.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.136
And finally, you not only get
immediate effects of mood with exercise

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.816
but those last for a long time.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.200
So you get long-lasting increases
in those good mood neurotransmitters.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.496
But really, the most transformative thing
that exercise will do
