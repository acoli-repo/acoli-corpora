00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.896
The first is the prefrontal cortex,
right behind your forehead,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.800
critical for things like decision-making,
focus, attention and your personality.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.616
The second key area is located
in the temporal lobe, shown right here.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.776
You have two temporal lobes in your brain,
the right and the left,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.416
and deep in the temporal lobe
is a key structure

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.136
critical for your ability

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.616
to form and retain new long-term
memories for facts and events.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.776
And that structure
is called the hippocampus.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.160
So I've always been fascinated
with the hippocampus.
