00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.640
seemed to be better in me.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.616
And that's when I put it together.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.856
Maybe all that exercise
that I had included and added to my life

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.096
was changing my brain.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.136
Maybe I did an experiment on myself
without even knowing it.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.776
So as a curious neuroscientist,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.496
I went to the literature to see
what I could find about what we knew

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.616
about the effects
of exercise on the brain.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.776
And what I found was an exciting
and a growing literature

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.976
that was essentially showing everything
that I noticed in myself.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.960
Better mood, better energy,
better memory, better attention.
