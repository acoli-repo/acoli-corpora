00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.376
I had no social life.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.136
I spent too much time
listening to those brain cells

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.736
in a dark room, by myself.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.896
(Laughter)

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.536
I didn't move my body at all.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.296
I had gained 25 pounds.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.136
And actually, it took me
many years to realize it,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.616
I was actually miserable.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.336
And I shouldn't be miserable.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.816
And I went on a river-rafting trip --
by myself, because I had no social life.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.096
And I came back --

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.136
(Laughter)

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.616
thinking, "Oh, my God,
I was the weakest person on that trip."

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.176
And I came back with a mission.
