And finally, studies have shown

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.896
that a single workout
will improve your reaction times

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.176
which basically means

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.536
that you are going to be faster
at catching that cup of Starbucks

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.296
that falls off the counter,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.056
which is very, very important.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.096
(Laughter)

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.040
But these immediate effects are transient,
they help you right after.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.536
What you have to do is do what I did,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.576
that is change your exercise regime,
increase your cardiorespiratory function,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.936
to get the long-lasting effects.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.216
And these effects are long-lasting

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.656
because exercise actually
changes the brain's anatomy,
