that you can do for your brain today.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.056
Now, as a neuroscientist,
I know that our brains,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.136
that is the thing in our head right now,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.256
that is the most complex structure
known to humankind.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.936
But it's one thing
to talk about the brain,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.400
and it's another to see it.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.736
So here is a real preserved human brain.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.616
And it's going to illustrate two key areas
that we are going to talk about today.

The first is the prefrontal cortex,
right behind your forehead,
