00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.936
And essentially try and decode how
those brief bursts of electrical activity,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.896
which is how neurons
communicate with each other,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.520
how those brief bursts either allowed us
to form a new memory, or did not.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.296
But a few years ago,
I did something very unusual in science.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.456
As a full professor of neural science,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.280
I decided to completely switch
my research program.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.136
Because I encountered something
that was so amazing,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.216
with the potential to change so many lives

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.496
that I had to study it.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.336
I discovered and I experienced
the brain-changing effects of exercise.
