But really, the most transformative thing
that exercise will do

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.696
is its protective effects on your brain.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.576
Here you can think
about the brain like a muscle.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.256
The more you're working out,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.120
the bigger and stronger your hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex gets.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.936
Why is that important?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.736
Because the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.536
are the two areas that are most
susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.480
and normal cognitive decline in aging.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.136
So with increased exercise
over your lifetime,
