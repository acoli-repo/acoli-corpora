and also to improve your brain
and protect your brain the best

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.736
for the rest of your life.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.816
But it's one thing to talk about exercise,
and it's another to do it.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.576
So I'm going to invoke my power
as a certified exercise instructor,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.176
to ask you all to stand up.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.056
(Laughter)

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.336
We're going to do
just one minute of exercise.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.856
It's call-and-response,
just do what I do, say what I say,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.016
and make sure you don't punch
your neighbor, OK?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.256
Music!

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.896
(Upbeat music)

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.416
Five, six, seven, eight,
it's right, left, right, left.
