00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.656
because exercise actually
changes the brain's anatomy,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.680
physiology and function.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.600
Let's start with my favorite
brain area, the hippocampus.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.736
The hippocampus --

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.216
or exercise actually
produces brand new brain cells,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.896
new brain cells in the hippocampus,
that actually increase its volume,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.256
as well as improve
your long-term memory, OK?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.720
And that including in you and me.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.016
Number two: the most common finding
in neuroscience studies,
