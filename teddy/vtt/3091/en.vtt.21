to trying to understand how exercise
can improve our brain function,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.576
and my goal in my lab right now

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.736
is to go beyond that rule of thumb
that I just gave you --

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.656
three to four times a week, 30 minutes.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.896
I want to understand
the optimum exercise prescription

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.896
for you, at your age,
at your fitness level,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.816

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.616
to maximize the effects of exercise today

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.936
and also to improve your brain
