00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.486
that if quantum mechanics
plays a role in mutations,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.809
surely this must have big implications,

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.527
to understand certain types of mutations,

00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:09.307
possibly even those that lead
to turning a cell cancerous.

00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:16.102
Another example of quantum mechanics
in biology is quantum coherence,

00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.479
in one of the most
important processes in biology,

00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:22.444
photosynthesis: plants
and bacteria taking sunlight,

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:25.422
and using that energy to create biomass.

00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:30.367
Quantum coherence is the idea
of quantum entities multitasking.
