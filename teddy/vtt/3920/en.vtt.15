00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:32.418
and it didn't really go very far.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.069
But as I mentioned at the start,

00:07:35.093 --> 00:07:37.892
in the last 10 years, there have been
experiments emerging,

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.971
showing where some of these
certain phenomena in biology

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.758
do seem to require quantum mechanics.

00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:46.905
I want to share with you
just a few of the exciting ones.

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:51.922
This is one of the best-known
phenomena in the quantum world,

00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:53.647
quantum tunneling.

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:58.060
The box on the left shows
the wavelike, spread-out distribution

00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:00.845
of a quantum entity --
a particle, like an electron,
