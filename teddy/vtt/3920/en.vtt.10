00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:01.453
you'd guess it was some
sort of stunt, of course.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.068
But in the quantum world,
this happens all the time.

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:07.890
Particles can multitask,
they can be in two places at once.

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:10.242
They can do more than one thing
at the same time.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.909
Particles can behave
like spread-out waves.

00:05:13.298 --> 00:05:14.897
It's almost like magic.

00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:18.287
Physicists and chemists have had
nearly a century

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.957
of trying to get used to this weirdness.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:22.795
I don't blame the biologists

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.454
for not having to or wanting
to learn quantum mechanics.

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:28.676
You see, this weirdness is very delicate;

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.150
and we physicists work very hard
to maintain it in our labs.
