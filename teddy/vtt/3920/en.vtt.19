00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:31.281
And it's always been a mystery
how they do this.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.839
Well, it was discovered

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:37.715
that one of the tricks that enzymes
have evolved to make use of,

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:42.967
is by transferring subatomic particles,
like electrons and indeed protons,

00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.652
from one part of a molecule
to another via quantum tunneling.

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.184
It's efficient, it's fast,
it can disappear --

00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:54.319
a proton can disappear from one place,
and reappear on the other.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.972
Enzymes help this take place.

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:59.231
This is research that's been
carried out back in the 80s,

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:03.292
particularly by a group
in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.
