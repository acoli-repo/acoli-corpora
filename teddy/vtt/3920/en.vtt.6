00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.477
that explain the world of the very small.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:03.873
And it's a world that's very different
from our everyday world,

00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:05.416
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.997
It's a world built
on probability and chance.

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:11.120
It's a fuzzy world.

00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:12.874
It's a world of phantoms,

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:16.246
where particles can also behave
like spread-out waves.

00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:21.019
If we imagine quantum mechanics
or quantum physics, then,

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:26.257
as the fundamental
foundation of reality itself,

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.011
then it's not surprising that we say

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.455
quantum physics underpins
organic chemistry.
