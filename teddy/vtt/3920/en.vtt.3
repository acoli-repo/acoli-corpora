00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:31.080
So I sort of feel happy
that I'm still astonished by it.

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.849
That's a good thing.

00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:39.758
But it means I study the very
smallest structures in the universe --

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.857
the building blocks of reality.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.096
If we think about the scale of size,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.072
start with an everyday object
like the tennis ball,

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:50.997
and just go down orders
of magnitude in size --

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:56.218
from the eye of a needle down to a cell,
down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.971
you eventually reach the nano-world.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.490
Now, nanotechnology may be
a term you've heard of.
