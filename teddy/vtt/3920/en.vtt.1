00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:31.856
also play a role inside the living cell?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.959
In other words: Are there processes,
mechanisms, phenomena

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.971
in living organisms
that can only be explained

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:42.738
with a helping hand
from quantum mechanics?

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.183
Now, quantum biology isn't new;

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.608
it's been around since the early 1930s.

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:51.643
But it's only in the last decade or so
that careful experiments --

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.131
in biochemistry labs,
using spectroscopy --

00:00:55.155 --> 00:01:02.018
have shown very clear, firm evidence
that there are certain specific mechanisms
