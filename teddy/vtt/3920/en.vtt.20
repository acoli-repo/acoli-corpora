00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:03.292
particularly by a group
in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.

00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:05.521
Other groups in the UK
have now also confirmed

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:06.956
that enzymes really do this.

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:11.597
Research carried out by my group --

00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:14.055
so as I mentioned,
I'm a nuclear physicist,

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.134
but I've realized I've got these tools
of using quantum mechanics

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:22.243
in atomic nuclei, and so can apply
those tools in other areas as well.

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.214
One question we asked

00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:29.536
is whether quantum tunneling
plays a role in mutations in DNA.

00:10:29.843 --> 00:10:33.503
Again, this is not a new idea;
it goes all the way back to the early 60s.
