Quantum coherence is the idea
of quantum entities multitasking.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:32.516
It's the quantum skier.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.492
It's an object that behaves like a wave,

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.418
so that it doesn't just move
in one direction or the other,

00:12:38.442 --> 00:12:41.762
but can follow multiple pathways
at the same time.

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:46.624
Some years ago,
the world of science was shocked

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:50.232
when a paper was published
showing experimental evidence

00:12:50.256 --> 00:12:54.032
that quantum coherence
takes place inside bacteria,

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:55.742
carrying out photosynthesis.

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:58.830
The idea is that the photon,
the particle of light, the sunlight,

00:12:58.854 --> 00:13:02.198
the quantum of light
captured by a chlorophyll molecule,
