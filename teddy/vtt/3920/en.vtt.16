00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:00.845
of a quantum entity --
a particle, like an electron,

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:04.506
which is not a little ball
bouncing off a wall.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.269
It's a wave that has a certain probability
of being able to permeate

00:08:09.293 --> 00:08:12.699
through a solid wall, like a phantom
leaping through to the other side.

00:08:12.723 --> 00:08:16.821
You can see a faint smudge of light
in the right-hand box.

00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:22.385
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle
can hit an impenetrable barrier,

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:24.869
and yet somehow, as though by magic,

00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:27.337
disappear from one side
and reappear on the other.

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:31.909
The nicest way of explaining it is
if you want to throw a ball over a wall,
