00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.455
quantum physics underpins
organic chemistry.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.599
After all, it gives us
the rules that tell us

00:03:32.623 --> 00:03:35.264
how the atoms fit together
to make organic molecules.

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:38.527
Organic chemistry,
scaled up in complexity,

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.873
gives us molecular biology,
which of course leads to life itself.

00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:44.151
So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:45.389
It's almost trivial.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:49.633
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately
must depend of quantum mechanics."

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.531
But so does everything else.

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.170
So does all inanimate matter,
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:01.379
Ultimately, there's a quantum level
