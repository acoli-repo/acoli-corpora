Well, the only theory in town --

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.841
we don't know if it's the correct theory,
but the only theory in town --

00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:37.849
is that it does it via something
called quantum entanglement.

00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:40.941
Inside the robin's retina --

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:45.197
I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina
is a protein called cryptochrome,

00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.601
which is light-sensitive.

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:50.564
Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons
are quantum-entangled.

00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:53.820
Now, quantum entanglement
is when two particles are far apart,

00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:56.678
and yet somehow remain
in contact with each other.

00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.437
Even Einstein hated this idea;

00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.500
he called it "spooky action
at a distance."
