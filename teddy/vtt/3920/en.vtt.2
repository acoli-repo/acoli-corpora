WEBVTT

00:00:55.155 --> 00:01:02.018
have shown very clear, firm evidence
that there are certain specific mechanisms

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:04.553
that require quantum mechanics
to explain them.

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:09.003
Quantum biology brings together
quantum physicists, biochemists,

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:12.668
molecular biologists --
it's a very interdisciplinary field.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:16.621
I come from quantum physics,
so I'm a nuclear physicist.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.910
I've spent more than three decades

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.863
trying to get my head
around quantum mechanics.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.380
One of the founders
of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:27.754
said, If you're not astonished by it,
then you haven't understood it.

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:31.080
So I sort of feel happy
that I'm still astonished by it.
