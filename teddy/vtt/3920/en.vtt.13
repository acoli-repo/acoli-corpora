In 1944, he wrote a book
called "What is Life?"

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.570
It was tremendously influential.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:36.475
It influenced Francis Crick
and James Watson,

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.022
the discoverers of the double-helix
structure of DNA.

00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:43.011
To paraphrase a description
in the book, he says:

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:48.821
At the molecular level,
living organisms have a certain order,

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.077
a structure to them that's very different

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.837
from the random thermodynamic jostling
of atoms and molecules

00:06:56.861 --> 00:07:00.567
in inanimate matter
of the same complexity.
