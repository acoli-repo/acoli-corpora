00:05:58.762 --> 00:06:03.612
And these are reductionist,
deterministic chemical reactions,

00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:08.750
showing that, essentially, life is made
of the same stuff as everything else,

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:11.834
and if we can forget about quantum
mechanics in the macro world,

00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:15.104
then we should be able to forget
about it in biology, as well.

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:19.070
Well, one man begged
to differ with this idea.

00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:23.531
Erwin Schrödinger,
of Schrödinger's Cat fame,

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:24.872
was an Austrian physicist.

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:28.079
He was one of the founders
of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.

00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:31.370
In 1944, he wrote a book
called "What is Life?"
