00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.718
I'd like to introduce you
to an emerging area of science,

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:09.685
one that is still speculative
but hugely exciting,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.338
and certainly one
that's growing very rapidly.

00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:17.496
Quantum biology
asks a very simple question:

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.870
Does quantum mechanics --

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:22.196
that weird and wonderful
and powerful theory

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.908
of the subatomic world
of atoms and molecules

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:28.420
that underpins so much
of modern physics and chemistry --

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:31.856
also play a role inside the living cell?
