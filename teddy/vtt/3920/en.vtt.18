00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.981
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.

00:09:02.655 --> 00:09:04.164
The particles fuse together,

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:07.886
and the Sun turns hydrogen
into helium through quantum tunneling.

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:14.684
Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered
that quantum tunneling also takes place

00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:15.900
inside living cells.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:22.556
Enzymes, those workhorses of life,
the catalysts of chemical reactions --

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.746
enzymes are biomolecules that speed up
chemical reactions in living cells,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.473
by many, many orders of magnitude.

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:31.281
And it's always been a mystery
how they do this.
