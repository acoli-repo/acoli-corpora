00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:30.895
this can lead to a mutation.

00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:33.076
This has been known for half a century.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.443
The question is: How likely
are they to do that,

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.845
and if they do, how do they do it?

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:40.888
Do they jump across,
like the ball going over the wall?

00:11:40.912 --> 00:11:44.414
Or can they quantum-tunnel across,
even if they don't have enough energy?

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:49.341
Early indications suggest that
quantum tunneling can play a role here.

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:51.489
We still don't know yet
how important it is;

00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:53.305
this is still an open question.

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:55.349
It's speculative,

00:11:55.373 --> 00:11:58.016
but it's one of those questions
that is so important

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.486
that if quantum mechanics
plays a role in mutations,
