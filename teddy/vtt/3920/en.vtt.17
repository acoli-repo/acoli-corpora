The nicest way of explaining it is
if you want to throw a ball over a wall,

00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:35.510
you have to give it enough energy
to get over the top of the wall.

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.592
In the quantum world,
you don't have to throw it over the wall,

00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:42.023
you can throw it at the wall,
and there's a certain non-zero probability

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:45.370
that it'll disappear on your side,
and reappear on the other.

00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:47.072
This isn't speculation, by the way.

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:50.492
We're happy -- well, "happy"
is not the right word --

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.561
(Laughter)

00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:54.203
we are familiar with this.

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:56.972
(Laughter)

00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:59.290
Quantum tunneling
takes place all the time;

00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.981
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.
