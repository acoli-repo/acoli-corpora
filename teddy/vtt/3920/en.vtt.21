00:10:29.843 --> 00:10:33.503
Again, this is not a new idea;
it goes all the way back to the early 60s.

00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:36.488
The two strands of DNA,
the double-helix structure,

00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.335
are held together by rungs;
it's like a twisted ladder.

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:42.866
And those rungs of the ladder
are hydrogen bonds --

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.680
protons, that act as the glue
between the two strands.

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:51.454
So if you zoom in, what they're doing
is holding these large molecules --

00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.085
nucleotides -- together.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.280
Zoom in a bit more.

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:57.220
So, this a computer simulation.

00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:01.397
The two white balls
in the middle are protons,
