00:06:56.861 --> 00:07:00.567
in inanimate matter
of the same complexity.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:06.518
In fact, living matter seems to behave
in this order, in a structure,

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:10.376
just like inanimate matter
cooled down to near absolute zero,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.433
where quantum effects
play a very important role.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.440
There's something special
about the structure -- the order --

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:20.024
inside a living cell.

00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:25.341
So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe
quantum mechanics plays a role in life.

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:29.521
It's a very speculative,
far-reaching idea,

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:32.418
and it didn't really go very far.
