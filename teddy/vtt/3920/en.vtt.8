00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:01.379
Ultimately, there's a quantum level

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.586
where we have to delve into
this weirdness.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.026
But in everyday life,
we can forget about it.

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:09.603
Because once you put together
trillions of atoms,

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:12.242
that quantum weirdness
just dissolves away.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.857
Quantum biology isn't about this.

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:20.437
Quantum biology isn't this obvious.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:24.690
Of course quantum mechanics
underpins life at some molecular level.

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:31.258
Quantum biology is about looking
for the non-trivial --
