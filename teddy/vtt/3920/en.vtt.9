Quantum biology is about looking
for the non-trivial --

00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:35.758
the counterintuitive ideas
in quantum mechanics --

00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:38.797
and to see if they do, indeed,
play an important role

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.273
in describing the processes of life.

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:47.873
Here is my perfect example
of the counterintuitiveness

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:49.343
of the quantum world.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:50.618
This is the quantum skier.

00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:53.282
He seems to be intact,
he seems to be perfectly healthy,

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:57.433
and yet, he seems to have gone around
both sides of that tree at the same time.

00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.120
Well, if you saw tracks like that

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:01.453
you'd guess it was some
sort of stunt, of course.
