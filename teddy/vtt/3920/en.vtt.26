00:12:58.854 --> 00:13:02.198
the quantum of light
captured by a chlorophyll molecule,

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:04.813
is then delivered to what's called
the reaction center,

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:06.901
where it can be turned into
chemical energy.

00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:09.573
And in getting there,
it doesn't just follow one route;

00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:11.812
it follows multiple pathways at once,

00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:16.173
to optimize the most efficient way
of reaching the reaction center

00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:17.918
without dissipating as waste heat.

00:13:19.228 --> 00:13:22.537
Quantum coherence taking place
inside a living cell.

00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:24.681
A remarkable idea,

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:30.940
and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,
with new papers coming out,
