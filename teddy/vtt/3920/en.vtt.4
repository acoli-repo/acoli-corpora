00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.490
Now, nanotechnology may be
a term you've heard of.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.694
A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.930
My area is the atomic nucleus,
which is the tiny dot inside an atom.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:10.886
It's even smaller in scale.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.828
This is the domain of quantum mechanics,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:15.368
and physicists and chemists
have had a long time

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:16.693
to try and get used to it.

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:21.705
Biologists, on the other hand,
have got off lightly, in my view.

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:26.402
They are very happy with their
balls-and-sticks models of molecules.

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:27.508
(Laughter)

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:30.730
The balls are the atoms, the sticks
are the bonds between the atoms.
