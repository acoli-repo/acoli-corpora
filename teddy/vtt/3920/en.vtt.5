The balls are the atoms, the sticks
are the bonds between the atoms.

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.248
And when they can't build them
physically in the lab,

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:35.664
nowadays, they have
very powerful computers

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.655
that will simulate a huge molecule.

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.343
This is a protein made up
of 100,000 atoms.

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:46.338
It doesn't really require much in the way
of quantum mechanics to explain it.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.584
Quantum mechanics
was developed in the 1920s.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:57.845
It is a set of beautiful and powerful
mathematical rules and ideas

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.477
that explain the world of the very small.
