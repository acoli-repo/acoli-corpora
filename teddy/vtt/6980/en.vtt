In the late 17th century,

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.762
a medical student named Johannes Hofer
noticed a strange illness

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.593
affecting Swiss mercenaries 
serving abroad.

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:16.622
Its symptoms,

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:17.534
including fatigue,

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:18.573
insomnia,

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:19.902
irregular heartbeat,

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:21.223
indigestion,

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:23.334
and fever were so strong,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.513
the soldiers often had to be discharged.

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:30.445
As Hofer discovered, the cause was not
some physical disturbance,
