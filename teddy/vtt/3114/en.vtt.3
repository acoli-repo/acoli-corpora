00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.348
And without realizing it,
I had stumbled upon a key

00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:35.039
to helping children read.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:36.814
Identity.

00:01:37.344 --> 00:01:40.266
Instead of fixating on skills

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.772
and moving students
from one reading level to another,

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:49.310
or forcing struggling readers
to memorize lists of unfamiliar words,

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:53.031
we should be asking ourselves
this question:

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:57.407
How can we inspire children
to identify as readers?

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:03.021
