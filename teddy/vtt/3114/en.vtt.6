Moonlighting as a stand-up comedian
for the past eight years,

00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:05.979
I understand the importance
of cultural competency,

00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.950
which I define as the ability to translate

00:03:08.974 --> 00:03:13.085
what you want someone else
to know or be able to do

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.324
into communication or experiences
that they find relevant and engaging.

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:21.365
Before going on stage,
I assess an audience.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.998
Are they white, are they Latino?

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:27.675
Are they old, young,
professional, conservative?

00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:31.084
Then I curate and modify my jokes
