00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:04.103
found that the number one thing
children look for when choosing a book

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.294
is a book that will make them laugh.

00:06:07.198 --> 00:06:12.742
So if we're serious about helping
black boys and other children to read

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:14.687
when it's not required,

00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:17.460
we need to incorporate
relevant male reading models

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:18.817
into early literacy

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:24.241
and exchange some of the children's books
that adults love so much

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:29.090
for funny, silly or even gross books,
like "Gross Greg".
