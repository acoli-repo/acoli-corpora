DeSean, a brilliant first-grader
I taught in the Bronx,

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:06.585
he helped me understand
how identity shapes learning.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.348
One day during math,
I walk up to DeSean, and I say,

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:13.308
"DeSean, you're a great mathematician."

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.409
He looks at me and responds,

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.970
"I'm not a mathematician,
I'm a math genius!"

00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:19.255
(Laughter)

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.643
OK DeSean, right?

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:23.575
Reading?

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.244
Completely different story.

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:26.868
"Mr. Irby, I can't read.

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:29.731
I'm never going to learn
to read," he would say.
