Then I curate and modify my jokes

00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:33.849
based on what I think
would generate the most laughter.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.940
While performing in a church,
I could tell bar jokes.

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.905
But that might not result in laughter.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.784
(Laughter)

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:47.949
As a society, we're creating
reading experiences for children

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:51.084
that are the equivalent
of telling bar jokes in a church.

00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:54.392
And then we wonder
why so many children don't read.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.285
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.461
believed that teaching and learning
should be two-way.
