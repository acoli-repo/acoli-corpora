What cultural factors,
what social cues are present

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.880
that would lead
a young black boy to conclude

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.997
that reading is even
something he should do?

00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:10.944
This is why I created Barbershop Books.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.748
It's a literacy nonprofit

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:18.772
that creates child-friendly
reading spaces in barber shops.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:21.407
The mission is simple:

00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.498
to help young black boys
identify as readers.

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:29.260
Lots of black boys go to the barber shop
once or twice a month.

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:33.393
Some see their barbers
more than they see their fathers.
