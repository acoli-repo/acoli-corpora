I’m here today as a guest

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:07.454
on land that was stolen from the Ute,
Cheyenne and Arapaho Nations.

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:10.621
Land that many other tribal nations
thought of as home

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:15.079
before those relationships
were written over by settler colonialism.

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.954
So land acknowledgments like this
have become pretty commonplace --

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.371
at the beginning of events,
at universities,

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.163
sometimes in our email signatures.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.454
But I've always found them
to be kind of confusing.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:31.121
Once you admit something is stolen,
aren’t you supposed to give it back?
