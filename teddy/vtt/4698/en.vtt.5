00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:30.303
such as milk, oranges, and spinach.

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.691
The gene heightens normally occurring connections

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.939
between the taste area in his frontal lobe

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.481
and the color area further back.

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:39.269
But suppose in someone else

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.683
that the gene acted in non-sensory areas.

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.579
You would then have the ability to link

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.772
seemingly unrelated things,

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:47.948
which is the definition of metaphor,

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:50.787
seeing the similar in the dissimilar.

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.997
Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:55.374
in artists who excel at making metaphors,

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.541
like novelist Vladimir Nabokov,

00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:59.293
painter David Hockney,

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.693
and composers Billy Joel
