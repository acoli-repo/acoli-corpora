00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:30.369
For James, college tastes like sausage,

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.411
as does message and similar words

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.206
with the -age ending.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:38.542
Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes,

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:40.125
rather than a disorder

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.754
because there's nothing wrong.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:43.104
In fact, all the extra hooks

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:45.997
endow synesthetes with superior memories.

00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:49.309
For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.346
"Let's see, she had a green name.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:52.310
D's are green:

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.847
Debra,

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:53.229
Darby,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.646
Dorothy,

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.146
Denise.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.920
Yes! Her name is Denise!"

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.359
Once established in childhood,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.736
pairings remain fixed for life.
