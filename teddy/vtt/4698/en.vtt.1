00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:30.437
Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:33.123
while Derek tastes like earwax.

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:35.807
Welcome to synesthesia,

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.072
the neurological phenomenon

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:41.032
that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:43.505
A synesthete might not only hear my voice,

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.413
but also see it,

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:44.920

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.555
or feel it as a physical touch.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.065
Sharing the same root with anesthesia,

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.400
meaning no sensation,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.152
synesthesia means joined sensation.

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:57.446
Having one type, such as colored hearing,

00:00:57.446 --> 00:00:59.699
gives you a 50% chance of having a second,

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.116
third,
