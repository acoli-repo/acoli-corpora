00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.736
pairings remain fixed for life.

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:03.254
Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.282
for hyperconnecting brain neurons,

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.017
but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts,

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:08.870
such as calendars,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.536
food names,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.245
and alphabets.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.833
The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.378
in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception.

00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:19.793
In this way, synesthesia provides a path

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:22.049
to understanding subjective differences,

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.385
how two people can see the same thing differently.

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.972
Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food,

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:30.303
such as milk, oranges, and spinach.
