00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.693
and composers Billy Joel

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:02.219
and Lady Gaga.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.002
But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.583
understand metaphors like "sharp cheese"

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.632
or "sweet person"?

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:12.009
It so happens that sight,

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.342
sound,

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:12.891
and movement

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:15.300
already map to one another so closely,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.732
that even bad ventriloquists convince us

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.646
that the dummy is talking.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:21.478
Movies, likewise, can convince us

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:23.526
that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:25.694
rather than surrounding speakers.

00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:28.447
So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes,

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.449
outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings
