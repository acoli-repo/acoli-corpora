It is an amazingly positive thing.

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:04.204
It takes an army of people
to make it really work.

00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:08.189
And I'll just add that I think butterflies

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:10.522
probably really do have
enough on their plate

00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:12.650
without carrying around human souls.

00:11:12.978 --> 00:11:14.928
(Laughter)

00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:16.832
But there's a lot we don't know, right?

00:11:16.856 --> 00:11:20.048
And what about all those stories?
What are those stories telling us?

00:11:20.072 --> 00:11:23.925
Maybe we coevolved our souls
with butterflies?

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:28.626
Certainly, we are connected to butterflies
in deeper ways than we currently know,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.223
and the mystery of the butterfly
will never be revealed
