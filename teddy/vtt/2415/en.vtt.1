00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.860
similar mythologies about butterflies
having to do with the human soul.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:36.567
Some cultures tell us butterflies
are carrying the souls of children

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.083
who have died wrongly or too soon,

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:41.194
and other cultures
tell us that butterflies

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:44.128
are carrying the souls
of our ancestors among us.

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:48.326
This butterfly is called
a Kallima inachus.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.644
On one side, it looks
like a beautiful butterfly,

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:52.762
and on the other side,
it looks like a leaf,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.007
and it folds up like a leaf
to elude predators.

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:56.825
So now you see it, now you don't,

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:58.678
something hidden, something revealed.

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:02.507
Maybe we got our ideas about
the human soul from this butterfly.
