00:09:57.527 --> 00:10:03.182
and an artificial intelligence function
and an expert vetting system

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:05.873
works to verify that observation.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:10.016
The app gives the observation the date,
the time, the latitude and the longitude,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.056
geolocates that observation.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.440
That's the data, that's the science
of citizen science.

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:17.856
And then that data is shared,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.572
and that sharing,
that is the soul of citizen science.

00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:23.437
When we share data,

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.961
we can see much bigger pictures
of what's going on.

00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:29.934
There's no way to see
that whole monarch migration

00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:34.405
without sharing data
that's been collected over decades,
