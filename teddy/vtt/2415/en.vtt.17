00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:34.612
We're up to, like,
a million observations of biodiversity

00:08:34.636 --> 00:08:38.915
collected by people
around the globe this past April.

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:43.614
The winner this year was South Africa,
much to the chagrin of San Francisco.

00:08:43.638 --> 00:08:44.800
(Laughter)

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.323
Look at them, they have
more biodiversity than we do.

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:50.831
It's kind of an interesting thing,
what is revealed when you start seeing

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:53.061
what are the natural resources
where you live,

00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:56.699
because as we go forward, you want to live
where there's more biodiversity.

00:08:56.723 --> 00:09:00.131
And by the way, citizen science
is a very good tool for social justice
