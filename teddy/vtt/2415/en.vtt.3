00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:30.235
around the world,

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.585
but even more than that,

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.950
insects are declining,
declining, declining.

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:36.133
In the last 50 years,

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:40.681
we've lost nearly 50 percent
of the total number of bodies of insects.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:43.323
Now this is a disaster.

00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:47.862
It could impact us in a more serious way
more quickly than climate change,

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:53.140
because butterflies don't do that much
in the ecosystem that we depend on,

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:56.705
but they do things for other creatures
that we do depend on,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.863
and that's the same story
with all insect life.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:03.966
Insect life is at the very foundation
of our life-support systems.
