00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:31.034
so the plant developed a longer spur.

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:32.265
Over millions of years,

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.424
the plant and the moth
developed a relationship

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:39.550
whereby they both make each other's
chances of existence better.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:45.043
The monarch butterfly has a different kind
of coevolutionary relationship,

00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:47.528
and today, it is at the heart
of what's going wrong

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:48.893
for the monarch butterfly.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.693
So this is a map of
the monarch butterfly migration.

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:53.751
The monarch does this amazing thing,

00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:55.273
and over the course of a year,

00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:58.787
it goes over the entirety
of North America.

00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.126
It does this in four or five generations.
