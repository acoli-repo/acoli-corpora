00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:01.015
Milkweed is toxic.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.197
It has a poison in it that it evolved
to deter other insects from eating it,

00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:09.089
but the monarch developed
a different kind of relationship,

00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:11.333
a different strategy with the milkweed.

00:07:11.357 --> 00:07:13.592
Not only does it tolerate the toxin,

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:17.318
the monarch actually sequesters
the toxin in its body,

00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:21.024
thus becoming poisonous to its predators.

00:07:21.746 --> 00:07:24.460
Monarch butterflies will only
lay their eggs on milkweed,

00:07:24.484 --> 00:07:27.429
and monarch caterpillars
will only eat milkweed,

00:07:27.453 --> 00:07:32.452
because they need that toxin to actually
create what they are as a species.
