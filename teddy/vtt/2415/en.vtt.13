there were four million counted.

00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:32.121
Last year, 30,000.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.146
(Audience gasps)

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.438
Four million to 30,000 since the 1980s.

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:39.832
The monarchs on the east coast
are doing a little better,

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.235

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:52.371

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.219

00:06:55.243 --> 00:06:58.610
It's another coevolutionary relationship,
and here's the story.

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:01.015
Milkweed is toxic.
