00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:34.405
without sharing data
that's been collected over decades,

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:37.041
seeing the heart and soul
of how nature works

00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:38.859
through citizen science.

00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:40.988
This is a Xerces blue butterfly,

00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:45.035
which went extinct when it lost
its habitat in Golden Gate Park.

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:48.646
It had a coevolutionary relationship
with an ant, and that's another story.

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:50.594
(Laughter)

00:10:50.618 --> 00:10:53.578
I'll end by asking you,

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:58.147
please participate in citizen science
in some way, shape or form.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.482
It is an amazingly positive thing.
