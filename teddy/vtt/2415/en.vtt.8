00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.857
And he was right.

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:05.082
This is a map of the monarch butterfly.

00:04:05.573 --> 00:04:08.090
So, the monarch butterfly
has a different story

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.590
than that particular moth,

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:15.074
but reflects the same kind
of fundamental idea that Darwin had

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:16.669
called coevolution,

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:19.877
and coevolution is at the heart
of how nature works,

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.067
and it's also at the heart
of what's going wrong with nature today.

00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:28.185
So over time, as the moth
developed a longer proboscis,

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:31.034
so the plant developed a longer spur.
