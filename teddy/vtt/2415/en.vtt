Hi there.

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.545
I'm in the habit of saying
I would like it if butterflies could talk,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.710
but I've been recently reconsidering that,

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.250
because we already have
a pretty loud world.

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:15.766
Can you imagine if butterflies
were yakking out there all over the place?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.724
But I would like to ask butterflies
one question, which is,

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:24.510
what is the meaning of some of the stories
that we humans tell about them?

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:28.796
Because remarkably, all over the world,
cultures have really similar stories,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.860
similar mythologies about butterflies
having to do with the human soul.
