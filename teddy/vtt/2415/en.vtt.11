00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.932
and nobody that they're immediately
related to has been there before either.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.559
We don't know how they do it.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.316
The reason we know
they do this kind of migration --

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.579
and we still have a lot
of unanswered questions

00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:41.058
about the monarch migration --

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:42.717
is because of citizen science.

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.035
So for decades,
people have made observations

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.994
about monarch butterflies,
where and when they see them,

00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:54.522
and they've contributed these observations
to platforms like Journey North.

00:05:54.922 --> 00:06:01.032
This is a map of some observations
of butterflies given to Journey North.
