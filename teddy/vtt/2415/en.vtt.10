00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.126
It does this in four or five generations.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.425
The first generations
only live a couple of weeks.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.379
They mate, they lay eggs and they die.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.157
The next generation emerges as butterflies
and takes the next leg of the journey.

00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:13.785
Nobody knows how they do it.

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:17.857
By the time the fifth generation comes
back around -- and that one lives longer,

00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:20.749
they overwinter
in Mexico and California --

00:05:20.773 --> 00:05:22.323
by the time it gets there,

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:25.803
those butterflies are going back
to where their ancestors came from,

00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:27.606
but they've never been there before,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.932
and nobody that they're immediately
related to has been there before either.
