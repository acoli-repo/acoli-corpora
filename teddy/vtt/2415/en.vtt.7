So this person showed this
to Darwin and said,

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:35.971
"This proves that evolution
does not come about in a natural way.

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:41.190
This flower proves that only God
can make these incredibly bizarre

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:44.552
and tricky-looking creatures on the earth,

00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:47.354
because no insect
could possibly pollinate this.

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:49.556
God must reproduce it."

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.071
And Darwin said, "No, I'm sure
that there is an insect somewhere

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:58.766
with a proboscis long enough
to pollinate that star orchid."

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.857
And he was right.
