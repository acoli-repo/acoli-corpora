So people are planting milkweed
all over the country

00:07:37.873 --> 00:07:40.826
where we have lost milkweed
due to habitat destruction,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.047
pesticide use, herbicide use
and climate change impacts.

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:50.119
You can create a lot of butterfly habitat
and pollinator habitat on a windowsill.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.186
You go to a native nursery in your area

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.307
and find out what's native
to where you live,

00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:57.957
and you will bring
beautiful things to yourself.

00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.927
Now, citizen science can do even more
