00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.314
and it's really a pretty grassroots thing,

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:35.791
and we get very interesting information
about butterflies and other creatures

00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:37.976
when we do these bioblitzes.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.816
City Nature Challenge basically works
with a tool called iNaturalist,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.430
and iNaturalist is your entry drug
to citizen science. (Laughs)

00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:49.794
I suggest signing up for it
on a laptop or on a desktop,

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:51.785
and then you put the app on your phone.

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:57.503
With iNaturalist, you take a picture
of a bird, a bug, a snake, anything,

00:09:57.527 --> 00:10:03.182
and an artificial intelligence function
and an expert vetting system
