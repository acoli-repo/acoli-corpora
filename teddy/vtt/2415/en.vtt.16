00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.927
Now, citizen science can do even more
than rescue monarch butterflies.

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.801
It has the capacity to scale

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:09.793
to the level necessary
that we need to mobilize to save nature.

00:08:09.817 --> 00:08:11.092
And this is an example.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.097
It's called City Nature Challenge,

00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.249
and City Nature Challenge is a project
of the California Academy of Sciences

00:08:17.273 --> 00:08:20.542
and the Los Angeles
Museum of Natural History.

00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:25.374
So for four years, City Nature Challenge
has enjoined cities all over the globe

00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:28.866
to participate in counting up
biodiversity in their cities.
