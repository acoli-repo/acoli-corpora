00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:03.966
Insect life is at the very foundation
of our life-support systems.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.785
We can't lose these insects.

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:10.563
Biodiversity all over the globe
is in a vast decline.

00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:16.301
Habitat loss, pesticides, herbicides
and impacts of climate change.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:18.318
Habitat loss is very serious,

00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:21.406
and that's where we really
have to get developing better,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.580
more mindfully.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:26.819
It's the worst of times,

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:29.072
we are kind of overloaded
with our problems.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:32.389
It's also the best of times --
there's incredibly good news.
