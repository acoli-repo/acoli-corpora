00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.905
and this is actually
during the destruction.

00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:05.026
Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria:

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.200
before ...

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:08.051
and after.

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:12.816
Although virtual reconstructions
are primarily the main focus

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.022
of our project,

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:16.109
some people have been asking the question:

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:19.930
Can we print them in 3D?

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:24.812
We believe 3D printing
doesn't offer a straightforward solution

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:26.026
to lost heritage.

00:07:26.338 --> 00:07:28.287
Once an object is destroyed,

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.461
it's gone.
