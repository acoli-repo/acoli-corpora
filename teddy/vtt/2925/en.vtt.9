shown in blue.

00:04:32.282 --> 00:04:35.696
Now, this is a partial
reconstruction, I admit,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.312
but why would I say partial?

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:42.296

was positioned against a wall.

00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.474
We don't have photographs
taken of it from the back.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:51.291

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.024
I would need a proper camera,

00:04:53.048 --> 00:04:54.793
tripods, proper lighting,

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:57.307

Think about it:

00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:01.556
