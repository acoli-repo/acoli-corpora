00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.301
for digital preservation,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:01.884
an idea sprung to mind.

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:07.315
Maybe we can crowdsource the images
that were taken of these artifacts

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.154
before they were destroyed,

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:11.121
to create digital reconstructions.

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:12.915
If we can do that,

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.030
maybe we can put them
into a virtual museum

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:16.288
to tell that story.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.534
And so two weeks after we saw this video,

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.697
we started the project
called Project Mosul.

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.101
Remember the pictures of the statue
I showed you before?
