00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.925
and their pose

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.232
can still tell us their story.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.389
For example,

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:09.147
we believe that by wearing
a knee-length tunic

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.671
and open bare feet,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.276
this was representative of a priest.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:17.783
However, with a closer look
at this particular piece,

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:22.229
we can see that this tunic being worn
was elaborately decorated,

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:25.075
which has led many researchers to believe

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.972
this was actually a statue of a king
performing his religious functions.
