Using Sketchfab's online viewer,

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:36.477
we can show that we have reconstructed
three parts of the exterior of the tomb,

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.406
but we also have photos of the inside,

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.099
so we're beginning to create
a reconstruction of the wall

00:08:41.123 --> 00:08:42.273
and the ceiling.

00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:45.688
Archaeologists worked there
for many, many years,

00:08:45.712 --> 00:08:50.449
so we also have architectural
drawing plans of this lost heritage.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:58.721
Unfortunately, we are not only losing
cultural heritage to areas of conflict

00:08:58.745 --> 00:08:59.896
and at war --

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.219
we're also losing it to natural disasters.
