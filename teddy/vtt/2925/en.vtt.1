00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:30.864
your pictures --

00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:34.008
to reclaim the history that is being lost

00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:36.255
using innovative technology

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:38.382
and the effort of volunteers.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.203
In the early 20th century,

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:46.215
archaeologists discovered
hundreds of statues and artifacts

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.973
at the ancient city of Hatra,

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.147
in northern Iraq.

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:53.757
Statues like this one
were found in fragments,

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.918
some of them missing their heads or arms,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.455
yet the clothing that they are wearing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.925
and their pose
