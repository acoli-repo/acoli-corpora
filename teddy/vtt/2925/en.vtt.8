I know you may be thinking
this sounds like magic -- but it's not.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:05.023
Let me show you how it works.

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:07.818
Here are two crowdsourced images
of the same statue.

00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:10.323
What the computer can do

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:14.562
is it can detect similar features
between the photographs --

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.619
similar features of the object.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.545
Then, by using multiple photos,

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.297
in this case, it can begin
to reconstruct the object in 3D.

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:25.965
In this case,

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:29.421
you have the position of the cameras
when each image was taken,

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:30.623
shown in blue.
