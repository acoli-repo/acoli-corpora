Remember the pictures of the statue
I showed you before?

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:35.848
This is actually the crowdsourced
reconstruction of it

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:37.477
before it was destroyed.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:40.899
Now, many of you may be wondering,

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:42.661
how exactly does this work?

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.341
Well, the key to this technology
is called photogrammetry,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:48.821
and it was invented here, in Germany.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.296
It is the technology that allows us
to use two-dimensional images

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.269
taken of the same object
from different angles

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:57.688
to create a 3D model.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.468
I know you may be thinking
this sounds like magic -- but it's not.
