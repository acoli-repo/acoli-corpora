00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.219
we're also losing it to natural disasters.

00:09:02.878 --> 00:09:06.748
This is a 3D model
of Durbar Square in Kathmandu,

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:09.422
before the earthquake
that occurred last April ...

00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:11.547
and this is after.

00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:14.161
You may be thinking,

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.854
you didn't create these 3D models
with only tourist photographs,

00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:19.269
and that's true.

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.769
But what this represents

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:24.539
is the ability for large, public
organizations and private industry

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:26.973
to come together
for initiatives like ours.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:32.847
And so one of the major challenges
of our project, really,
