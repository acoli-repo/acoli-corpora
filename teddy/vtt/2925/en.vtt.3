When the Mosul Cultural Museum
opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.468
this statue, as well as others,

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.656
were placed there to preserve them
for future generations.

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:48.204
Following the US-led invasion
of Iraq in 2003,

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:52.093
a few statues and artifacts
were relocated to Baghdad,

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:54.192
but this statue remained.

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:59.206
Then in February of last year,
a video was released,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.631
and it instantly went viral.
