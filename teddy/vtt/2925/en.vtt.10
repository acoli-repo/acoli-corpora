How many of you, when you visit a museum,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.821
take photographs
of all parts of the statue,

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.310
even the back side of it?

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.003
Well, maybe if some of you find
Michelangelo's David interesting,

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:11.178
I guess --

00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:12.686
(Laughter)

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:14.657
But the thing is,

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.821
if we can find more images of this object,

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:19.469
we can improve the 3D model.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.307
When we started the project,

00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:25.480
we started it with
the Mosul Museum in mind.

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:27.171
We figured we may get a few images,

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:28.441
some people interested,

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:30.944
make one or two virtual reconstructions,
