00:10:03.183 --> 00:10:06.152
but we're also losing it

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:10.308
Any idea, just looking
at these two pictures?

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:14.289
Maybe it's a little difficult to remember,

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.733
but only a few weeks ago,

00:10:16.757 --> 00:10:21.367
this was the example of human
destruction by human stupidity.

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:27.258
Because a tourist in Lisbon
wanted to climb onto this statue

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:28.647
and take a selfie with it --

00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:29.672
(Laughter)

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.228
and pulled it down with him.
