(Singing ends)

00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:36.499
Not a very pleasant sight, right?

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.319
Did you notice anything
familiar in the video?

00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:43.055
There it is.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.751
There is that very statue,

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:47.518
as it was toppled over,

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.062
breaking into pieces.

00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:52.837
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.129
we were shocked.

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.487
Since we are archaeologists
using innovative technology

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.301
for digital preservation,
