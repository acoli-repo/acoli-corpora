00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.809
the partial reconstruction of the statue,

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.700
as well as the Lion of Mosul,

00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:36.396
the first reconstruction
completed by our project.

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.329
Although the video doesn't explicitly show
the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:46.486
we have many other examples
of large artifacts being destroyed

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.651
that were simply too large
to have been stolen.

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:51.535
For example,

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.345
the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.

00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:57.516
This is a digital
reconstruction from before,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.905
and this is actually
during the destruction.
