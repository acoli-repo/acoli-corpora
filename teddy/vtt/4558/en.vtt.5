At the end of the 37 days,

Gowers used his blog to announce
that they had solved the core problem;

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:41.234

The Polymath Project had succeeded.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:47.767
So what the Polymath Project
suggests, at least to me,

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.920
is that we can use
the internet to build tools

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.736
that actually expand our ability
