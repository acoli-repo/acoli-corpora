Well, good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.985
Thank you all very much
for coming along today.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.595

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.092
It's a story that begins,
but does not end,

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:13.757
with a mathematician named Tim Gowers.

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.625
Gowers is one of the world's most
renowned mathematicians.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.229
He's a professor at Cambridge University

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.542
and a recipient of the Fields Medal,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.306
often called the Nobel Prize
of mathematics.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.710
Gowers is also a blogger,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:35.707
