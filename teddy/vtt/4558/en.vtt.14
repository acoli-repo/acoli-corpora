00:06:57.192 --> 00:07:00.230
will do much more for your career
and your job prospects

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:04.126
than a long series of brilliant
contributions to such a site.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.504
So even though you may like the idea

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:09.270
and you may think it will advance
science more quickly,

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:13.121
you find you just can't conceive of it
as being part of your job.

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:14.378
It's not.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.164
The only things which can succeed
in this kind of environment

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:21.631
are projects like the Polymath Project,

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:25.800
which, even though they employ
an unconventional means to an end,

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.531
they have an essential
conservatism about them.

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.543
The end product of the Polymath Project
was still a scientific paper.
