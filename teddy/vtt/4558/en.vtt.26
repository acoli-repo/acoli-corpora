So we need to have a second
open science revolution.

00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:03.588
It is my belief

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:07.771
that any publicly funded science
should be open science.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.118
How can we achieve this change?

00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:16.436
Well, if you're a scientist -- and I know
many of you are not scientists,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.809
but if you are a scientist,

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.930
then there are things that you can do.

00:13:19.954 --> 00:13:23.393
You can get involved
in an open science project,

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:26.494
even if it's just for a small
fraction of your time.

00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:29.735
You can find forums online

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:32.312
where you can share
your knowledge in new ways,
