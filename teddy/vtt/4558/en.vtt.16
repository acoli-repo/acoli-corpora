It's a rare story where
the conservatism has been broken.

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:04.721
It occurred in the 1990s,
when, as you know,

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:09.178
for the first time, biologists were taking
large amounts of genetic data

00:08:09.202 --> 00:08:11.334
to collect in the Human Genome Project.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:14.192
And there were sites online

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:17.522
which would allow biologists
to upload that data

00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:20.223
so it could be shared
with other people around the world

00:08:20.247 --> 00:08:22.068
and analyzed by other people.

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.519
Probably the best known of these
is the site GenBank,

00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:28.018
which some of you may
have heard of or used.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.628
And these sites, like GenBank,
