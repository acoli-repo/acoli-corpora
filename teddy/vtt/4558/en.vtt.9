00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.952
about what the big open problems
in the field were,

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:35.527
people's speculation
about how to solve the problems,

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.711
and so on.

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:41.879
Like Wikipedia, the intention was
that it would be written by the users,

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:44.640
in this case, by experts
in quantum computing.

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:50.044
I was present at the conference at Caltech
in 2005, when it was announced.

00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:53.599
And some of the people who I spoke to
were very skeptical,

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:56.654
but some of the people
were very excited by the idea.

00:04:56.678 --> 00:04:58.696
They were impressed by the implementation;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.456
they were impressed by the amount
of initial seed material
