00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.257
there is so much knowledge
that is still locked up.

00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.359
I spoke with one bioinformatician

00:10:04.383 --> 00:10:09.800
who told me that he'd been "sitting
on the genome of an entire species

00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:11.235
for more than a year."

00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:13.724
An entire species.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:16.362
And in other parts of science,

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:20.181
it is routine that scientists
hoard their data.

00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:22.601
They hoard the computer code
that they write

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.044
that could be useful,
potentially, to other people.

00:10:25.068 --> 00:10:26.992
They hoard their best ideas.

00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:29.854
And they often hoard even
the descriptions of the problems

00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:31.790
that they think are most interesting.
