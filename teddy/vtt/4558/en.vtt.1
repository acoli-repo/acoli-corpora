00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:35.707
and in January of 2009, he used his blog
to pose a very striking question:

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:41.182
Is massively collaborative
mathematics possible?

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:45.204
So what he was proposing in this post

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:50.144
was to use his blog to attack a difficult
unsolved mathematical problem --

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:53.016
a problem which he said
he would "love to solve" --

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.512
completely in the open,

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:58.945
using his blog to post his ideas
and his partial progress.
