00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.628
And these sites, like GenBank,

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:36.960
had the problem in common with Qwiki
that scientists -- they're not paid

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:39.590
or rewarded for sharing their data.

00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:42.774
It's all about publishing papers.

00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:46.841
So there was a considerable reluctance
to actually upload the data.

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.179
Yet, everybody could see
that this was silly --

00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:52.737
it was obvious that this
was the right thing to do.

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.311
But just because it was obvious

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.546
didn't mean that people
were actually doing it.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.611
So a meeting was convened
in Bermuda in 1996

00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:02.601
of many of the world's leading
molecular biologists.
