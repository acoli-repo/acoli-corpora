27 different people would post
800 substantive comments

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.827
containing 170,000 words.

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:09.571
I was not a serious participant,
but I was following along closely

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.747
from the start,

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.433
and it was just amazing.

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:15.335
The speed with which an idea
would be tentatively proposed

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.234
and then really rapidly developed
by other people and improved,

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.432
sometimes discarded --

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:21.788
it was just amazing.

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.533
Gowers described the process

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:29.347
as being to ordinary research
"as driving is to pushing a car."

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.594
