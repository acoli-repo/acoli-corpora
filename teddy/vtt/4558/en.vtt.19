00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:30.148
the US National Institutes of Health,
the UK Wellcome Trust --

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:32.120
and actually baked into policy.

00:09:35.147 --> 00:09:38.991
So it meant that if you were a scientist
who wanted to work on the human genome,

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.239
you had to agree to abide
by these principles.

00:09:41.263 --> 00:09:44.128
And today, I'm very pleased
to say, as a result,

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:48.029
you can go online -- anybody here --
and download the human genome.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.805
So that's a terrific story.

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:53.548
But the human genome
is just a tiny, tiny fraction

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:55.631
of all scientific knowledge.

00:09:56.727 --> 00:09:59.783
Even just in other parts of genetics,

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.257
there is so much knowledge
that is still locked up.
