00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:01.278
Or, to put it in another way:

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:05.955
we can build tools which actively amplify
our collective intelligence

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.463
in much the same way as, for millennia,
we've used physical tools

00:03:10.487 --> 00:03:12.268
to amplify our strength.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.623
OK?

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:19.260
So what I'd like to talk about today,
or what I'd like to explore today,

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.742
is what this means for science.

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:25.501
It's much more important than just solving
a single mathematical problem.

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.974
It means an expansion in the range
of scientific problems

00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:31.197
we can hope to attack at all.
