doing the work that you love.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.185
But it's incredibly competitive
to get such jobs.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:37.260
Often, there'll be hundreds of very
highly qualified applicants for positions.

00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:43.121
And so you find yourself working
60, 70, 80 hours a week,

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:47.630
doing the one thing that you know
will get you such a job,

00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:49.916
and that is writing scientific papers.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.911
You may think that the Qwiki
is a wonderful idea in principle,

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:57.168
but you also know that writing
a single mediocre paper

00:06:57.192 --> 00:07:00.230
will do much more for your career
and your job prospects
