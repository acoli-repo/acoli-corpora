we can hope to attack at all.

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:35.305
It means, potentially, an acceleration
in the rate of scientific discovery.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.686
It means a change in the way
we construct knowledge itself.

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.354
So, before I get too overexcited, however,

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:45.344
I would like to talk

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:50.173
Particularly, I'd like to describe

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.324
It occurred in 2005, or started in 2005.

00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:59.716
A grad student at Caltech named
John Stockton had a very good idea

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.480
for what he called the "Quantum Wiki,"
