What's more, he issued an open invitation,

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:08.057
inviting anybody in the world who thought
that they had an idea to contribute

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:12.265
to post their idea
in the comment section of the blog.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:17.362
His hope was that by combining
the ideas of many minds,

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.406
he could make easy work
of his hard mathematical problem.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.556
He called this experiment
the Polymath Project.

00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:27.344
Well, the Polymath Project
got off to a slow start.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.964
In the first seven hours,
nobody posted any comments.
