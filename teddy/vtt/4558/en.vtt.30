00:14:57.392 --> 00:15:00.856
then the scientific community
will inevitably find --

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.844
it will be dragged
by the population at large

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:05.167
in the right direction.

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.578
There are simple things you can do.

00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:10.716
You can talk to your friends
and acquaintances who are scientists

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.693
and just ask them
what are they doing to work more openly.

00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:16.631
Or you can use your imagination
and your personal power

00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:18.870
to raise awareness in other ways.

00:15:19.414 --> 00:15:22.155
We're talking about changing
not just what scientists do

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:23.775
but what grant agencies do,

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.521
what universities do
and what governments do.

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:29.112
And you can influence all of those things.
