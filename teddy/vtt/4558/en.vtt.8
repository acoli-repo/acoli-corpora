00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.480
for what he called the "Quantum Wiki,"

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.505
or "Qwiki" for short.

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:05.670
(Laughter)

00:04:05.694 --> 00:04:07.403
OK? It's a great idea.

00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:10.407
What he did with the Qwiki was --

00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:13.732
the idea of the Qwiki was that it
was going to be a great repository

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:14.910
of human knowledge,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.250
much like Wikipedia.

00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:19.128
But instead of being focused
on general knowledge,

00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:23.534
it was going to be focused on
specialist knowledge in quantum computing.

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:27.125
It was going be kind of
a supertextbook for the field,

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.619
with information about
all the latest research,

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.952
about what the big open problems
in the field were,
