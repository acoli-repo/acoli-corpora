00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:31.790
that they think are most interesting.

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:35.647
And so, what I and other people
in the Open Science movement

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.839
would like to do is,

00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:38.709
we'd like to change this situation.

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:41.214
We would like to change
the culture of science

00:10:41.238 --> 00:10:43.877
so that scientists become
much more strongly motivated

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:46.544
to share all of these
different kinds of knowledge.

00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:50.987
We want to change the values
of individual scientists

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:54.508
so they start to see it
as part of their job

00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.062
to be sharing their data,
to be sharing their code,

00:10:57.086 --> 00:11:00.595
to be sharing their best ideas
and their problems.
