Many scientists, in fields ranging
from genetics to string theory,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.737
have tried to start science wikis
along very similar lines.

00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:39.922
And typically, they've failed
for essentially the same reason.

00:05:40.732 --> 00:05:42.628
It's not just science wikis, either.

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:44.699
Inspired by Facebook,

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:48.852
many organizations have tried to create
social networks for scientists,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:53.037
which will connect scientists
to other people with similar interests.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:59.072
So they can share things like data
or code, their ideas and so on.

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:00.973
Again, it sounds like a good idea.
