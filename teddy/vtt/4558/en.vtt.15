00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.543
The end product of the Polymath Project
was still a scientific paper.

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.854
In fact, it was several papers. Right?

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.195
So unconventional means,
but conventional ends.

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.234
So there's a kind of
conservatism about it.

00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:44.952
And don't get me wrong --
the Polymath Project is terrific,

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:49.355
but it is a pity that scientists
can only use tools

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.807
which have this kind of
conservative nature.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.604
So let me tell you a story
about an instance

00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:57.747
where we moved away
from this conservatism.

00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.988
It's a rare story where
the conservatism has been broken.
