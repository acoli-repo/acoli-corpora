00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:32.312
where you can share
your knowledge in new ways,

00:13:32.336 --> 00:13:35.508
ways that allow other people
to build on that knowledge.

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.345
You can also, if you're more ambitious,

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.844
start an open science project of your own.

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:44.194
If you're really bold,
you may wish to experiment

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:46.447
with entirely new ways of collaborating,

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.535
in much the same way
as the Polymath Project did.

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:55.525
But above all, what you should do
is be very generous in giving credit

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:59.131
to those of your colleagues
who are practicing science in the open

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:00.983
and to promote their work.
