00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:34.050
But then, a mathematician
from the University of British Columbia

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:35.621
named Jozsef Solymosi

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.330
posted a short comment.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:40.343
And this seemed to break the ice,
because a few minutes later,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:44.009
a high school teacher named
Jason Dyer posted a suggestion.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.758
And a few minutes after that,

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:49.537
another mathematician named
Terence Tao, also a Fields medalist,

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:51.200
posted an idea.

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:54.567
And things really started
to move quickly at this point.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.688
Over the next 37 days,

00:01:56.712 --> 00:02:01.811
