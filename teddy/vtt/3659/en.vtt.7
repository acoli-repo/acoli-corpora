00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:34.562
An adequately nutritious, low-cost diet
for a mom and two young kids

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:37.546
costs 477 dollars a month.

00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:42.195
With EITC money, that family
can eat for five to six months.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.938
Or think about medical care.

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:48.945
Twenty million children in the US
lack access to care

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.102
meeting modern pediatric standards.

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:58.532
And yet, the average cost of that care
is only 400 dollars per kid per year.

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:02.739
EITC money can help fix
this access problem.
