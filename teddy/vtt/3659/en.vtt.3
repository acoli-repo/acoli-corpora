00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.244
But one out of five families
who could get it doesn't,

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:34.929
and most who do
lose of hundreds of dollars

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.837
to the for-profit
tax-preparation industry.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.073
One day, a mom asked us
why we couldn't do her taxes

00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:44.693
while she waited for the doctor.

00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:45.726
(Laughter)

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.994
We all know that purgatory.
Why not make good use of that time?

00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:52.078
So we started StreetCred,

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:57.280
an organization prescribing
tax preparation in clinics serving kids.

00:01:57.674 --> 00:01:59.729
This is a brand-new approach

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:03.079
and one that left some
questioning our sanity.
