Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.897
They tend to consolidate
in the hands of the few,

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:36.287
and sometimes they find their way out
into the hands of the many.

00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:41.488
And so most of you aren't tackling
oppressive regimes on the weekends,

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:45.714
so I wanted to think of a few examples
that might be a little bit more relatable.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:50.066
In the world of wearables
and smartphones and apps,

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:53.329
there's a big movement
to track people's personal health

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.377
with applications that track
the number of calories that you burn

00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:01.220
or whether you're sitting too much
or walking enough.
