or walking enough.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.561
These technologies make patient intake
in medical facilities much more efficient,

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:11.496
and in turn, these medical facilities

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:14.083
are starting to expect
these types of efficiencies.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.883
As these digital tools
find their way into medical rooms,

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:18.928
and they become digitally ready,

00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:21.297
what happens to the digitally invisible?

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.297
What does the medical experience look like

00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:26.655
for someone who doesn't have
the $400 phone or watch

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.448
tracking their every movement?

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.281
Do they now become a burden
on the medical system?
