A final example from
across the world in East Africa:

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:06.782
there's been a huge movement
to digitize land ownership rights,

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.383
for a number of reasons.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:11.285
Migrant communities,
older generations dying off,

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.925
and ultimately poor record-keeping

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:17.392
have led to conflicts over who owns what.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:21.664
And so there was a big movement
to put all this information online,

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:25.424
to track all the ownership
of these plots of land,

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.119
put them in the cloud,
and give them to the communities.

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:31.161
But actually, the unintended
consequence of this
