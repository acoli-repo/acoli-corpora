And so the question that I ask myself
is, what happens to the last community

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.070
using paper notes when the rest
of the world moves to digital currency?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.055
Another example from my hometown
in Philadelphia:

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.220
I recently went
to the public library there,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.792
and they are facing an existential crisis.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:17.465
Public funding is dwindling,

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:22.641
they have to reduce their footprint
to stay open and stay relevant,

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:25.477
and so one of the ways
they're going about this

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:28.770
is digitizing a number of the books
and moving them to the cloud.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.745
This is great for most kids. Right?
