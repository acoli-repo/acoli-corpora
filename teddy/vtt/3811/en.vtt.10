00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.753
We think more about doing things
than the outcomes of what we are doing.

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:05.220
This needs to change.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.251
We have a responsibility to think about
the outcomes of the technologies we build,

00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.734
especially as they increasingly
control the world in which we live.

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.174
In the late '90s,

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:18.283
there was a big push for ethics
in the world of investment and banking.

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:22.091
I think in 2014, we're long overdue
for a similar movement

00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.753
in the area of tech and technology.

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:30.535
So, I just encourage you, as you are all
thinking about the next big thing,
