00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.621
that if we build great things,

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.035
it will positively affect everyone.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:07.904
Eventually, these innovations
will get out and find everyone.

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:10.003
But that's not always the case.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:15.784
I like to call this blind championing
of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.129
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.045
We tend to think that if
we design things for the select few,

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:23.447
eventually those technologies
will reach everyone,

00:01:23.447 --> 00:01:25.002
and that's not always the case.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:30.018
Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
