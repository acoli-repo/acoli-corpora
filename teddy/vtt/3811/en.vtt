00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.479
As a software developer and technologist,

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.126
I've worked on a number
of civic technology projects

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.472
over the years.

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:12.118
Civic tech is sometimes
referred to as tech for good,

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:15.763
using technology to solve
humanitarian problems.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:17.876
This is in 2010 in Uganda,

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:20.616
working on a solution
that allowed local populations

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:24.099
to avoid government surveillance
on their mobile phones

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.328
for expressing dissent.

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:29.216
That same technology was deployed
later in North Africa

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.998
for similar purposes
to help activists stay connected
