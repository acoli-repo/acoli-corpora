You can check out books from home,

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.147

to school or from school,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.339
but these are really two big assumptions,

that one, you have access at home,

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.936
and two, that you have access

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:44.812

How do they stay competitive?

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.466
A final example from
across the world in East Africa:
