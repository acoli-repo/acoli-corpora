evasion, avoiding conflict.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.688
And the weird thing was
that as I was falling into the valley --

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:36.416
it was a valley of disconnection --

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.474
a lot of other people
were doing that, too.

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:41.023
And that's sort of
the secret to my career;

00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:42.820
a lot of the things that happen to me

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:45.002
are always happening

(Laughter)

00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:50.837
And so I was detached.

00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:54.514
And at the same time,
a lot of other people were detached

00:02:54.538 --> 00:02:57.053
and isolated and fragmented
from each other.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:03:00.157
Thirty-five percent of Americans
over 45 are chronically lonely.
