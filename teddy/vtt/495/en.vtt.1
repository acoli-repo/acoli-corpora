00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:30.377
there were Post-it notes.

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:34.131
If you opened the other drawers
where there should have been plates,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:35.305
I had envelopes.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:39.282
I had work friends, weekday friends,
but I didn't have weekend friends.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:43.542
And so my weekends
were these long, howling silences.

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.640
And I was lonely.

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:49.968
And loneliness, unexpectedly,
came to me in the form of --

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.248
it felt like fear,
a burning in my stomach.

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:55.953
And it felt a little like drunkenness,

00:00:55.977 --> 00:01:00.907
just making bad decisions,
just fluidity, lack of solidity.
