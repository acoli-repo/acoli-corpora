00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.355
and only then are you capable
of being loved.

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:05.049
I have a friend who said
that when her daughter was born,

00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:08.676
she realized that she loved her
more than evolution required.

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:10.184
(Laughter)

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:11.613
And I've always loved that.

00:07:11.637 --> 00:07:12.779
(Applause)

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:15.760
Because it talks about the peace
that's at the deep of ourself,

00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:18.489
our inexplicable care for one another.

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:21.457
And when you touch that spot,
you're ready to be rescued.

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:24.131
The hard thing about
when you're in the valley

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.648
is that you can't climb out;

00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:28.829
somebody has to reach in and pull you out.

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.486
It happened to me.
