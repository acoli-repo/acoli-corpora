00:08:00.323 --> 00:08:03.299
And I'm not the huggiest guy
on the face of the earth,

00:08:03.323 --> 00:08:06.902
but I've been going back to that home
every Thursday night when I'm in town,

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:08.470
and just hugging all those kids.

00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:10.379
They demand intimacy.

00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:14.013
They demand that you behave in a way
where you're showing all the way up.

00:08:14.442 --> 00:08:16.236
And they teach you a new way to live,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.561
which is the cure
for all the ills of our culture

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:21.531
which is a way of direct --
really putting relationship first,

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:24.725
not just as a word, but as a reality.

00:08:25.557 --> 00:08:29.628
And the beautiful thing is,
these communities are everywhere.

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:33.299
I started something at the Aspen Institute
called "Weave: The Social Fabric."
