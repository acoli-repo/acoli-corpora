We need to name the language
of a recovered society.

00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:05.291
And to me, the weavers
have found that language.

00:14:05.593 --> 00:14:08.694
My theory of social change
is that society changes

00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:11.363
when a small group of people
find a better way to live,

00:14:11.387 --> 00:14:13.062
and the rest of us copy them.

00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:16.403
And these weavers have found
a better way to live.

00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:18.380
And you don't have to theorize about it.

00:14:18.404 --> 00:14:21.633
They are out there as community builders
all around the country.

00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:24.554
We just have to shift our lives a little,

00:14:24.578 --> 00:14:27.309
so we can say, "I'm a weaver,
we're a weaver."

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:29.365
And if we do that,
