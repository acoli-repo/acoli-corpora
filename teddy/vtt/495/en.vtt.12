00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:01.810
Now, I don't ask you to believe in God
or not believe in God,

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:04.421
but I do ask you to believe
that there's a piece of you

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:06.421
that has no shape, size, color or weight,

00:06:06.445 --> 00:06:09.371
but that gives you

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.752
Rich and successful people

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.036
And what the soul does
is it yearns for righteousness.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.639
The heart yearns for fusion with another,
the soul yearns for righteousness.

00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:32.948
And that led to my third realization,
which I borrowed from Einstein:
