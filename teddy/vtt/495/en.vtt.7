00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:32.178
72,000 die from opioid addictions;

00:03:32.202 --> 00:03:35.551
life expectancy is falling, not rising.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.572
So what I mean to tell you,
I flew out here to say

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:42.524
that we have an economic crisis,
we have environmental crisis,

00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:43.913
we have a political crisis.

00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:46.016
We also have a social
and relational crisis;

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.379
we're in the valley.

00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:49.006
We're fragmented from each other,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.622
we've got cascades of lies
coming out of Washington ...

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:52.979
We're in the valley.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.443
And so I've spent the last five years --

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:56.981
how do you get out of a valley?

00:03:57.356 --> 00:04:00.469
The Greeks used to say,
"You suffer your way to wisdom."
