E.O. Wilson wrote a great book
called "Naturalist," about his childhood.

00:11:05.712 --> 00:11:08.411
When he was seven,
his parents were divorcing.

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:12.458
And they sent him
to Paradise Beach in North Florida.

00:11:12.482 --> 00:11:14.318
And he'd never seen the ocean before.

00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:17.062
And he'd never seen a jellyfish before.

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:21.177
He wrote, "The creature was astonishing.
It existed beyond my imagination."

00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:23.257
He was sitting on the dock one day

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:26.018
and he saw a stingray
float beneath his feet.

00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:30.445
And at that moment, a naturalist was born
in the awe and wonder.
