He kept asking me the same thing
over and over, 'Are you feeling it?'

00:13:01.784 --> 00:13:05.633
My ridiculous heels were killing me,
I was terrified that I might die,

00:13:05.657 --> 00:13:08.105
yet I felt simultaneously
overwhelmed with delight

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:10.440
that 'Can I Kick It?'
should happen to be playing

00:13:10.464 --> 00:13:12.810
on this precise moment
in the history of the world

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:13.989
on the sound system,

00:13:14.013 --> 00:13:16.141
and it was now morphing
into 'Teen Spirit.'

00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:19.323
I took the man's hand,
the top of my head blew away,

00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:22.747
we danced, we danced,
we gave ourselves up to joy."

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.486
And so what I'm trying to describe
is two different life mindsets.

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:32.466
The first mountain mindset, which is about
individual happiness and career success.
