00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:32.466
The first mountain mindset, which is about
individual happiness and career success.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.053
And it's a good mindset,
I have nothing against it.

00:13:35.077 --> 00:13:37.371
But we're in a national valley,

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:40.228
because we don't have
the other mindset to balance it.

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:42.815
We no longer feel good
about ourselves as a people,

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:45.529
we've lost our defining
faith in our future,

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:48.935
we don't see each other deeply,
we don't treat each other as well.

00:13:49.538 --> 00:13:51.529
And we need a lot of changes.

00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:54.259
We need an economic change
and environmental change.

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.847
But we also need a cultural
and relational revolution.

00:13:57.871 --> 00:14:02.141
We need to name the language
of a recovered society.
