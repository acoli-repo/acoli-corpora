00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:32.948
And that led to my third realization,
which I borrowed from Einstein:

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:36.141
"The problem you have
is not going to be solved

00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:38.879
at the level of consciousness
on which you created it.

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:42.776
You have to expand
to a different level of consciousness."

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.014
So what do you do?

00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:47.148
Well, the first thing you do
is you throw yourself on your friends

00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:50.133
and you have deeper conversations
that you ever had before.

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:51.514
But the second thing you do,

00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:53.672
you have to go out alone
into the wilderness.

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:56.768
You go out into that place
where there's nobody there to perform,

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:59.172
and the ego has nothing to do,
and it crumbles,

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.355
and only then are you capable
of being loved.
