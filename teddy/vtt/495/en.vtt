00:00:00.911 --> 00:00:03.019
So, we all have bad seasons in life.

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:05.674
And I had one in 2013.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.719
My marriage had just ended,

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.395
and I was humiliated
by that failed commitment.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.221
My kids had left home for college
or were leaving.

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:16.368
I grew up mostly
in the conservative movement,

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:17.992
but conservatism had changed,

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.008
so I lost a lot of those friends, too.

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.430
And so what I did is,
I lived alone in an apartment,

00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:24.654
and I just worked.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.830
If you opened the kitchen drawers
where there should have been utensils,

00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:30.377
there were Post-it notes.
