00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.929
The second thing I learned

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:33.549
is that when you have
one of those bad moments in life,

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:34.868
you can either be broken,

00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:36.431
or you can be broken open.

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:38.731
And we all know people who are broken.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.271
They've endured some pain
or grief, they get smaller,

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:43.675
they get angrier, resentful,
they lash out.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.854
As the saying is,

00:04:44.878 --> 00:04:47.576
"Pain that is not transformed
gets transmitted."

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.756
But other people are broken open.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.226
Suffering's great power
is that it's an interruption of life.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.019
It reminds you you're not the person
you thought you were.

00:04:57.043 --> 00:04:58.580
The theologian Paul Tillich said

00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:02.021
what suffering does is it carves through
what you thought was the floor
