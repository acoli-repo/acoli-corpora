00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:30.335
it's the moment when a naturalist
feels just free in nature.

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:34.177
It's the moment where you're so lost
in your work or a cause,

00:12:34.201 --> 00:12:36.201
you have totally self-forgotten.

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:39.535
And joy is a better thing
to aim for than happiness.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:42.600
I collect passages of joy,
of people when they lose it.

00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:44.871
One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith.

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:48.205
In 1999, she was in a London nightclub,

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:51.324
looking for her friends,
wondering where her handbag was.

00:12:51.348 --> 00:12:53.451
And suddenly, as she writes,

00:12:53.475 --> 00:12:56.797
"... a rail-thin man with enormous eyes
reached across a sea of bodies

00:12:56.821 --> 00:12:57.997
for my hand.

00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:01.760
He kept asking me the same thing
over and over, 'Are you feeling it?'
