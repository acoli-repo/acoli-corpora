00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:02.579
And she Googled "volunteer in Englewood,"
and now she runs R.A.G.E.,

00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:04.400
the big community organization there.

00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:07.403
Some of these people
have had tough valleys.

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:11.132
I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio
who came home from an antiquing trip

00:09:11.156 --> 00:09:14.918
and found that her husband
had killed himself and their two kids.

00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:19.195
She now runs a free pharmacy,
she volunteers in the community,

00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:22.211
she helps women cope
with violence, she teaches.

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:25.299
She told me, "I grew from this
experience because I was angry.

00:09:25.323 --> 00:09:28.093
I was going to fight back against
what he tried to do to me

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:29.863
by making a difference in the world.

00:09:29.887 --> 00:09:31.942
See, he didn't kill me.
