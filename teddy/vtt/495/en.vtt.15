00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.486
It happened to me.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.037
I got, luckily, invited over to a house
by a couple named Kathy and David,

00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.466
and they were --

00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:38.871
They had a kid in the DC
public school, his name's Santi.

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.997
Santi had a friend
who needed a place to stay

00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:42.887
because his mom had some health issues.

00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:45.593
And then that kid had a friend
and that kid had a friend.

00:07:45.617 --> 00:07:47.625
When I went to their house six years ago,

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:50.546
I walk in the door, there's like
25 around the kitchen table,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.919
a whole bunch sleeping
downstairs in the basement.

00:07:52.943 --> 00:07:55.006
I reach out to introduce myself to a kid,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.634
and he says, "We don't really
shake hands here.

00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:59.779
We just hug here."
