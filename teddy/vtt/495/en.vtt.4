00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.600
The myth of the meritocracy
is you can earn dignity

00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:04.234
by attaching yourself
to prestigious brands.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:07.063
The emotion of the meritocracy
is conditional love,

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:08.942
you can "earn" your way to love.

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:12.387
The anthropology of the meritocracy
is you're not a soul to be purified,

00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.879
you're a set of skills to be maximized.

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:16.752
And the evil of the meritocracy

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:19.434
is that people who've achieved
a little more than others

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.744
are actually worth
a little more than others.

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.004
And so the wages of sin are sin.

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:26.699
And my sins were the sins of omission--

00:02:26.723 --> 00:02:29.191
not reaching out,
failing to show up for my friends,

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.730
evasion, avoiding conflict.
