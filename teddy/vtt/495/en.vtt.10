00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:02.021
what suffering does is it carves through
what you thought was the floor

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:03.428
of the basement of your soul,

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:05.962
and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below,

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:08.478
and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below.

00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:11.511
You realize there are depths of yourself
you never anticipated,

00:05:11.535 --> 00:05:14.486
and only spiritual and relational food
will fill those depths.

00:05:16.173 --> 00:05:19.141
And when you get down there,
you get out of the head of the ego

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:20.847
and you get into the heart,

00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:22.633
the desiring heart.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:26.288
The idea that what we really yearn for
is longing and love for another,

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:29.358
the kind of thing that Louis de Bernières
described in his book,

00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:31.280
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin."
