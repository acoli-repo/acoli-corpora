00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My story actually began when I was four years old

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and my family moved to a new neighborhood

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this was the 1960s

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when actually all the streets in this neighborhood

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
were named after Confederate war generals.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And when I was five,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that made the rider look like an orangutan.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's why they were called ape hangers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,
