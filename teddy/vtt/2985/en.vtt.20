00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.320
so students like Filipe and others
can present information back.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.216
And we know technology
is not always perfect.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.816
You know, state officials expect

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.936
between five to 15 percent
of the classrooms

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.056
every day to be off live-stream

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.280
because of flood, broken antennas
or internet not working.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.936
And yet, Filipe is one
of over 300,000 students

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.136
that benefited from
the media center solution

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.600
and got access to postprimary education.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.976
This is a living example

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.856
how technology is not just an add-on
