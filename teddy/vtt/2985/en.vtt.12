00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.616
every person who finishes
tertiary education became a teacher --

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.069
we won't have enough teachers.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.216
And what about children in refugee camps,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.240
or in very remote rural areas?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.720
Take Filipe, for example.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.696
Filipe lives in one
of the thousands of communities

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720
alongside the Amazonas rivers.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.680
His village of 78 people has 20 families.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.496
Filipe and a fellow student

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.600
were the only two
attending grade 11 in 2015.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.096
Now, the Amazonas is a state
in the northwest of Brazil.
