00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.856
So we're pooling donor money
in a finance facility for education,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.256
which will provide
more finance for education.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.536
We will subsidize,
or even eliminate completely,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.496
interest payments on the loans

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.816
so that countries that commit to reforms

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.496
can borrow money,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.976
reform their education system,
and pay this money over time

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.560
while benefiting
from a better-educated population.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.576
This solution has been recognized
in the last G20 meeting in Germany,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.600
and so finally today
education is on the international agenda.
