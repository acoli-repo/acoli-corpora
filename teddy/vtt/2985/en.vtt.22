00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.000
The first one is called
the Pioneer Country Initiative.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.096
Over 20 countries from Africa and Asia

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.056
have committed to make
education their priority

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.856
and to transform their education
systems to deliver results.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.296
We've trained country leaders

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.096
in a methodology
called the delivery approach.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.016
What this does is basically two things.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.336
In the planning phase,
we take everyone into a room --

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.776
teachers, teacher unions,
parent associations,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.336
government officials, NGOs, everyone --

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.741
so that the reform
and the solution we come up with

00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:32.205
are shared by everyone
and supported by everyone.
