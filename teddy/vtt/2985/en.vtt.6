00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.056
but not any best in class --

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.880
the best in your own class.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.936
What we did is actually
we looked at countries by income level:

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.696
low-income, mid-income, high-income.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.960
We looked at what the 25 percent
fastest improvers in education do,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.656
and what we found out is

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.176
that if every country moves
at the same rate as the fastest improvers

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.656
within their own income level,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.056
then within just one generation

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.760
we can have every child
in school and learning.
