It's easier to make a shiny picture
of a bridge and show it to everyone

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.296
than one of an educated mind.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.440
That's kind of a longer term commitment.

00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:11.936
So we came up with a solution

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.136
to help countries escape
the middle income trap,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.376
countries that are not poor enough
or not poor, thankfully, anymore,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.896
that cannot profit from grants
or interest-free loans,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.416
and they're not rich enough

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.040
to be able to have attractive
interests on their loans.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.856
So we're pooling donor money
in a finance facility for education,
