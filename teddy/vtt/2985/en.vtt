00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.760
I'm the product
of a bold leadership decision.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.896
After 1956, when Tunisia
became independent,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.656
our first president, Habib Bourguiba,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.536
decided to invest 20 percent
of the country's national budget

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.136
in education.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.736
Yes, 20 percent,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.920
on the high end of the spectrum
even by today's standards.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.376
Some people protested.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.096
What about infrastructure?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.136
What about electricity,
roads and running water?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.520
Are these not important?
