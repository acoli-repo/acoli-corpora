00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.856
how technology is not just an add-on

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.496
but can be central to learning
and can help us bring school to children

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.640
if we cannot bring children to school.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.776
Now, I hear you.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.216
You're going to say,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.456
"How are we going to implement this
all over the world?"

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.016
I've been in government myself

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.280
and have seen how difficult it is
even to implement the best ideas.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.136
So as a commission,
we started two initiatives

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.400
to make the "Learning
Generation" a reality.
