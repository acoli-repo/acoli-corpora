00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.856
teachers in Vietnam are better monitored
than in other developing countries,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.480
and students' achievements
are made public.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.520
And it shows in the results.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.096
In the 2015 PISA --

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.776
Program for International
Student Assessment --

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.616
Vietnam outperformed
many wealthy economies,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.519
including the United States.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.696
Now, if you're not an education expert,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.656
you may ask, "What's new and different?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.120
Don't all countries track student progress
and make those achievements public?"
