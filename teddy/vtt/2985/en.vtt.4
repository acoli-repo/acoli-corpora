00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.016
Our first task was to find out:

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.696
How big is the learning crisis?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.680
What's actually the scope of the problem?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.296
Today we know:

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.496
half of the world's children by 2030

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.840
will be failing to learn.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.936
And that's how actually we discovered

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.656
that we need to change the world's focus
from schooling to learning,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.416
from just counting
how many bodies are in classrooms

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.120
to actually how many are learning.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
And the second big task was,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.960
can we do anything about this?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.176
Can we do anything
about this big, vast, silent,
