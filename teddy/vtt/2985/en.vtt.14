you know, in the Amazonas state,
is huge and expensive.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.016
How are you going to get, you know,
math and science and history teachers

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.376
all over those communities?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.016
And even if you find them,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.080
many of them would not want to move there.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.976
So faced with this impossible task,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.336
civil servants and state officials

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.360
developed amazing creativity
and entrepreneurship.
