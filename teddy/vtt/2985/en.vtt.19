00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.080
but in school and learning.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.576
And some of these content teachers,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.776
they became celebrity teachers.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.656
You know, some of them run for office,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.496
and they helped raise
the status of the profession

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.920
so that more students
wanted to become teachers.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.976
And what I love about this example

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.376
is beyond changing
the paradigm of the teacher.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.400
It teaches us how we can harness
technology for learning.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.776
The live-streaming is bidirectional,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.320
so students like Filipe and others
can present information back.
