00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.160
And that's what brought me here today,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.200
because today, we are facing
a global learning crisis.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.176
I call it learning crisis
and not education crisis,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.136
because on top of
the quarter of a billion children

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.760
who are out of school today,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.856
even more, 330 million children,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.680
are in school but failing to learn.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.576
And if we do nothing,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.256
if nothing changes,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.256
by 2030, just 13 years from now,
