But let me bring this back
to the personal level,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.520
because this is where the impact lands.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.296
Without that decision
to invest a young country's budget,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.936
20 percent of a young country's
budget in education,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.096
I would have never
been able to go to school,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.136
let alone in 2014

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.056
becoming a minister in the government

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.240
that successfully ended
the transition phase.
