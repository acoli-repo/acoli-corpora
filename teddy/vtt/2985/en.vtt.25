00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.256
Do you remember when I told you
about Vietnam earlier

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.680
outperforming the United States in PISA?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.376
That's due to a better education system,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.976
but also to Vietnam
increasing their investment

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.560
from seven to 20 percent
of their national budget in two decades.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.240
But what happens if countries
want to borrow money for education?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.176
If you wanted to borrow money
to build a bridge or a road,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.376
it's quite easy and straightforward,

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.840
but not for education.
