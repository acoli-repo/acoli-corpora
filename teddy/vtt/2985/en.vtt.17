00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.696
In Chile, for every doctor,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.655
you have four and a half people,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.760
four and a half staff supporting them,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.856
and Chile is on the low end
of the spectrum here,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.616
because in developing countries,
on average, every doctor

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.240
has 10 people supporting them.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.656
A teacher in Chile, however,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.416
has less than half a person,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.040
0.3 persons, supporting them.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.736
Imagine a hospital ward
with 20, 40, 70 patients
