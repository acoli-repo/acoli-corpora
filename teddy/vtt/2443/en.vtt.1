00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.131
that a single bright spot
on a scan of my right lung

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.090
meant that the cancer had already spread.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.123
I had metastatic breast cancer.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.166
I had no medical training at this point,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.280
but I knew what it meant if it were true:

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:44.360
incurable breast cancer.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.263
Terminal breast cancer.

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:51.390
I was 27 years old,

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:54.075
had just been accepted to medical school,

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:57.357
and I wondered if I was already
at the end of my life.

00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:03.006
My new oncologist was not a warm person.
