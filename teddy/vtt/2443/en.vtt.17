00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:32.540
but, somewhere in the discussion,
things get skewed.

00:08:32.564 --> 00:08:34.614
The choice becomes something more like,

00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:37.957
"Well, you could choose to do something,

00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:40.566
or you could choose to do nothing.

00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:45.735
We could be aggressive,
and treat your cancer,

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.117
or we could watch it."

00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:50.412
And 9.9 times out of 10, the patient says,

00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:54.050
"I want to do everything I can do."

00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:56.350
Of course.

00:08:56.374 --> 00:08:59.741
Who wouldn't want everything?
