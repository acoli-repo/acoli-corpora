Well, this is William.

00:11:32.064 --> 00:11:37.692
He is the most joyful person
that I have ever met,

00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:43.857
and in just over a year, he has already
made the world a better place.

00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:50.263
As oncologists, we talk to our patients

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:52.188
as if the worst thing that could happen

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.490
is that their cancer could come back,

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:57.598
or that it could spread,
or that they could die from it.

00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:00.888
As a patient, I know
that these are paramount.
