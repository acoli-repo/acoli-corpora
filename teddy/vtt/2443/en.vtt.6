00:02:56.297 --> 00:03:00.237
but it was a totally separate lung cancer,

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:02.256
and as crazy as it sounds,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.996
this was great news.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.596
I did not have metastatic breast cancer,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.909
I had two different cancers,

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:12.377
but both of them were localized,

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.655
and so the lung cancer
was localized enough

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.563
that it could be removed.

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:20.258
And so the onslaught of treatments began
with a lung surgery,

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:21.996
continued with chemotherapy

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.228
and ended with a breast surgery
just after my 28th birthday.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.623
And then two weeks later,

00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:31.355
I started medical school.
