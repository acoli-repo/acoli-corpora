00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.619
but a yes.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.465
And then, just as I was
getting comfortable

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:37.208
and feeling like I might not necessarily
fail out of medical school,

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:40.377
I received even more devastating news.

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:47.032
I learned that I had a mutation
in a gene called TP53, or p53 for short.

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.618
Known as the guardian of the genome,

00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:50.934
a mutation --

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:55.782
p53 is responsible for supervising
the repair of our DNA.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:59.666
A mutation in this gene
means errors go uncorrected.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.602
It means that normal cells
become cancerous at a much higher rate.
