Have your deferral letter in hand,
but use it on your terms.

00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:07.075
As I come to the end
of my oncology training,

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:10.537
I have déjà vu again and again
with the following scenario:

00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:12.531
A patient has cancer.

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:14.317
There are several options,

00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:20.286
all of which offer a different balance
between cure and quality of life,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.166
between the possibility
of alleviating suffering

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.098
and the possibility of causing suffering.

00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:29.202
An oncologist lays out the options,

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:32.540
but, somewhere in the discussion,
things get skewed.
