00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:03.534
Instead of imagining the suffering
that I might cause to a future partner

00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:05.620
when I died of cancer,

00:11:05.644 --> 00:11:08.557
I married my wonderful husband.

00:11:09.398 --> 00:11:11.475
Because the worst thing that can happen

00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:14.728
is always a series of negatives.

00:11:14.752 --> 00:11:16.859
It's blank spaces

00:11:16.883 --> 00:11:18.974
that should be filled with life.

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:26.498
So what is the most that I have leaned in
to this kind of radical uncertainty?

00:11:27.656 --> 00:11:30.800
Well, this is William.
