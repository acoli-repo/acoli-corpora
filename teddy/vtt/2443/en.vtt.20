00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:01.942
be at the center of our thinking, always?

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:10.727
Many unspeakably, unfathomably painful
and brutal things have happened to me

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:14.357
because of my cancers
and my genetic mutation.

00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:19.031
And yet, I consider myself
very lucky indeed,

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:22.063
because the worst thing
that could happen never came to pass;

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:28.183
because I have let devastation
and uncertainty sit at the table,

00:10:28.207 --> 00:10:30.712
but somewhere off to the side.
