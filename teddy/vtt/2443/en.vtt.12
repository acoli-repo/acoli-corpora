00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.602
It means that normal cells
become cancerous at a much higher rate.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:06.250
All of a sudden, with this knowledge,

00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:09.196
my medical history
made a terrible kind of sense.

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:14.044
I had had a childhood cancer --
rhabdomyosarcoma -- at age seven.

00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:16.074
It recurred when I was a teenager.

00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:19.709
And this was all before p53
had been discovered in the lab.

00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:23.661
Then I'd had young adult
breast and lung cancers.

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:26.502
With the knowledge of this mutation,

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:29.023
it seemed that there was likely no end

00:06:29.047 --> 00:06:32.164
to the number of cancers
that I could expect in my future.
