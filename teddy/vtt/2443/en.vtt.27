00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.380
my life looks like a neat package.

00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:37.134
It looks as if I planned
each successive step

00:13:37.158 --> 00:13:41.620
and that perhaps cancer
has led to the good things in my life.

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:45.672
Step one: apply to medical school.

00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:49.107
Step two: get diagnosed with
and treated for cancer.

00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:51.580
And step three: have it all,

00:13:51.604 --> 00:13:54.085
a career and a family.

00:13:55.266 --> 00:13:57.187
But I will tell you

00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:02.586
that each phase was a leap of faith
