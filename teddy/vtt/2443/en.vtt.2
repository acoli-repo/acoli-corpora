00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:03.006
My new oncologist was not a warm person.

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:06.371
She dealt in simple facts,

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.774
as many brilliant physicians do.

00:01:09.747 --> 00:01:13.623
"Our body is made up
of cells," she started.

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:15.941
I stopped her.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.574
"I'm starting medical school soon.

00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:19.828
I know."

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:25.493
Instead of taking this as a signal
to go backward, to start again,

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:27.227
she went forward.

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:29.704
She said that I would need
to start on chemotherapy

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:31.188
to control the cancer.
