00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.383
And for us, the worst thing
that could happen --

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:35.121
and I have heard more than one
oncologist say this --

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:36.731
the worst thing that could happen

00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:39.715
is that the patient
will develop metastatic disease.

00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:43.306
Or, the worst thing that could happen
is that five years from now,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.417
the cancer will grow,
and I'll have to give more radiation.

00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:49.667
As a patient and as an oncologist,

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:53.843
I would never argue that these
are not devastating outcomes.

00:09:53.867 --> 00:09:55.779
But are they the worst?

00:09:56.192 --> 00:09:58.691
Should cancer control

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:01.942
be at the center of our thinking, always?
