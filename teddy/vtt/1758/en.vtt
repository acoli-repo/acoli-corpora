The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:05.347
is almost like the weatherman.

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:08.863
We are always chasing storms.

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.746
We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms, that is.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.514
And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:19.964
but we rarely see or listen to one.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:21.598
So I always like to start these talks

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:24.580
by actually introducing you to one of them.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.007
Actually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron --

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.230
a hundred brain cells simultaneously --
