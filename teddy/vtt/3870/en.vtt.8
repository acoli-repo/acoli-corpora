00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.666
would be poor and damaged.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.488
And more than that,

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:07.796
the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:11.677
with immense risks to our climate.

00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:13.724
Concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:16.642
in the atmosphere are already

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:20.276
higher than they've been for millions of years.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.914
If we go on increasing those concentrations,

00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:27.288
we risk temperatures over the next century or so

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:28.905
that we have not seen on this planet

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:32.110
for tens of millions of years.
