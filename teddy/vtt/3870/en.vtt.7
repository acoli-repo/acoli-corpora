00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.956
on our water and on our forests.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:36.241
This is profound structural change.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:37.816
If we manage it in a negligent

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.435
or a shortsighted way,

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:44.301
we will create waste, pollution, congestion,

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:47.851
destruction of land and forests.

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:50.179
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.902
with my numbers — cities, energy, land —

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.781
if we manage all that badly,

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.862
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.673
of the people around the world

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.666
would be poor and damaged.
