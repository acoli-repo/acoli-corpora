00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:32.110
for tens of millions of years.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.236
We've been around as Homo sapiens —

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:37.407
that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:40.210
for perhaps a quarter of a million
years, a quarter of a million.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.441
We risk temperatures we haven't seen

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:46.180
for tens of millions of years over a century.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.250
That would transform the relationship

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.479
between human beings and the planet.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.130
It would lead to changing deserts,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.320
changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,
