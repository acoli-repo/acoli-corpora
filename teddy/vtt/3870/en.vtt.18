00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:02.213
all sorts of things that bring communities together.

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:04.070
We can do that, but we have to think,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.350
we have to invest, we have to plan.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.521
Let me turn to energy.

00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.743
Now, energy over the last 25 years

00:09:11.743 --> 00:09:13.979
has increased by about 50 percent.

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:16.596
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:18.254
Over the next 20 years,

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:22.030
perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.564
We have to invest strongly in energy,

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.838
we have to use it much more efficiently,

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.526
and we have to make it clean.

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:30.856
We can see how to do that.
