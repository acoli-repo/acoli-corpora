When I was there last in the spring,

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:02.892
there was an advisory for people of my age —

00:01:02.892 --> 00:01:05.322

to stay indoors and not move much.

00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:10.125
How did this come about?

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.545

from 10 million to 20 million.

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.498
dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:27.321
particularly coal.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.596
China burns half the world's coal each year,
