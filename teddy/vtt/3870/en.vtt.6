00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.503
Now, the first of these transformations

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.110
is the basic structural change

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.850
of the economies and societies

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.880
that I've already begun to illustrate

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.390
through the description of Beijing.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.349
Fifty percent now in urban areas.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.960
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.221
Over the next two decades, we'll see

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:22.134
the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:26.108
and the growth in the economy and in the population

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:29.090
is putting increasing pressure on our land,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.956
on our water and on our forests.
