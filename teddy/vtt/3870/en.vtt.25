00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.565
Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.

00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:32.455
It has ambitions to be a middle-income country

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:34.960
15 years from now

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.203
and to be carbon neutral.

00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:40.251
Again, I think it's a strong ambition

00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:42.546
but it is a plausible one.

00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:43.957
You're seeing that commitment there.

00:12:43.957 --> 00:12:45.223
You're seeing what can be done.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.788
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:51.410
It's working in the rehabilitation of land.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.840
In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.257
a wonderful project

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:57.440
to plant trees on degraded land

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.060
and work with local communities

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.509
on sustainable forest management
