00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:30.856
We can see how to do that.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.760
Take the example of California.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.370
It would be in the top 10 countries in the world

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.913
if it was independent.

00:09:37.913 --> 00:09:40.478
I don't want to start any —

00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:43.976
(Laughter)

00:09:43.976 --> 00:09:45.821
California's a big place.

00:09:45.821 --> 00:09:47.869
(Laughter)

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:50.610
In the next five or six years,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.324
they will likely move from

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:55.563
around 20 percent in renewables —

00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:57.320
wind, solar and so on —

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.793
to over 33 percent,

00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:02.232
and that would bring California back
