00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.596
China burns half the world's coal each year,

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:35.510
and that's why, it is a key reason why,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.535
it is the world's largest emitter

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.449
of greenhouse gases.

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:42.563
At the same time, we have to recognize

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:45.747
that in that period China has grown remarkably.

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:48.188
It has become the world's second largest economy.

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:49.657
Hundreds of millions of people

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:51.822
have been lifted out of poverty.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.903
That's really important.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.220
But at the same time, the people of China

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.820
are asking the question:

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.400
What's the value of this growth

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.525
if our cities are unlivable?
