00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:02.232
and that would bring California back

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:04.765
to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:06.722
to where they were in 1990,

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.466
a period when the economy in California

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:09.898
would more or less have doubled.

00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:11.348
That's a striking achievement.

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:12.831
It shows what can be done.

00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:16.138
Not just California — the 
incoming government of India

00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:19.164
is planning to get solar technology

00:10:19.164 --> 00:10:20.536
to light up the homes

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:22.246
of 400 million people

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:24.311
who don't have electricity in India.

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:26.791
They've set themselves a target of five years.

00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.020
I think they've got a good chance of doing that.
