00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:00.908
that this is an enormous opportunity.

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:03.135
It's an opportunity which we can use

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:06.532
or it's an opportunity which we can lose.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.255
And let me explain through those three key areas

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:11.965
that I've identified: cities, energy and land.

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.019
And let me start with cities.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.052
I've already described the problems of Beijing:

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:20.898
pollution, congestion, waste and so on.

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:24.588
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities

00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:25.847
around the world.

00:06:25.847 --> 00:06:28.772
Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,

00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:31.836
you have to think ahead.
