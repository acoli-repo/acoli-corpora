00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.320
changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.558
changing sea levels,

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:04.201
hundreds of millions of people,

00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:07.430
perhaps billions of people who would have to move,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.353
and if we've learned anything from history,

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.665
that means severe and extended conflict.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:13.543
And we couldn't just turn it off.

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.973
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.

00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:18.200
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.915
You're in there. You're stuck.

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.591
Those are the stakes we're playing for,

00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:24.313
and that's why we have to make
this second transformation,

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:25.953
the climate transformation,

00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:28.336
and move to a low-carbon economy.

00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:30.714
Now, the first of these transformations
