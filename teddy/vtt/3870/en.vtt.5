00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.429
the poorer countries of the world,

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.355
were, notwithstanding being
the vast majority of the people,

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.178
they accounted for only about a third

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.170
of the world's output.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.914
Now it's more than half;

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:42.885
25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:45.990
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.266
as developing.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.864
That's a remarkable change.

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:51.266
It means that most countries around the world,

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:53.325
rich or poor, are going to be facing

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:55.305
the two fundamental transformations

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.490
that I want to talk about and highlight.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.503
Now, the first of these transformations
