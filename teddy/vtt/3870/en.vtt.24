00:11:56.851 --> 00:12:00.496
by enforcing the law more strictly.

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:02.386
And it's not just stopping deforestation.

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:04.827
That's of course of first and fundamental importance,

00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:08.449
but it's also regrading degraded land,

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.849
regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:16.729
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:19.204
It was desperately poor. In the following years,

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:20.950
it suffered devastating famines

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.806
and profoundly destructive social conflict.

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:27.640
Over the last few years, actually more than a few,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.565
Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.
