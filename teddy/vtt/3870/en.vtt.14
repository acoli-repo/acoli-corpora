00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:02.113
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:06.131
The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.763
is a very important case of how to move around

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:11.333
safely and quickly in a non-polluting way

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.528
in a city: very frequent buses,

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:17.465
strongly protected routes, the same service, really,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.556
as an underground railway system,

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.367
but much, much cheaper

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.775
and can be done much more quickly,

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:25.670
a brilliant idea in many more cities

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.706
around the world that's developing.

00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:29.607
Now, some things in cities do take time.

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:32.660
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.
