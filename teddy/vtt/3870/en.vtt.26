on sustainable forest management

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.550
has led to big increases in living standards.

So we can see, from Beijing to London,

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:10.703
from California to India,

00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:13.830
from Brazil to Ethiopia,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.439

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.937
I don't have to list all those things

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:30.828
to an audience like this,
