00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:31.836
you have to think ahead.

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.250
The cities that are going to be built —

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.406
and there are many, and many big ones —

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:36.870
we have to think of how to design them

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.221
in a compact way

00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:41.664
so we can save travel time 
and we can save energy.

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:45.579
The cities that already are 
there, well established,

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.650
we have to think about renewal
and investment in them

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.428
so that we can connect ourselves much better

00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:53.820
within those cities, and make it easier,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.411
encourage more people, to live closer to the center.

00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:59.821
We've got examples building around the world

00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:02.113
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.
