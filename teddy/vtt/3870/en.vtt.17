You can see that the two
transformations I've described,

00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:37.858
the structural and the climate,

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:40.490
come very much together.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.423
But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:45.956
and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,

00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:50.492
we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,

00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:53.149
more attractive cities, more productive cities,

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.916
and stronger community in those cities —

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:58.164
public transport, recycling, reusing,

00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:02.213
all sorts of things that bring communities together.
