00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.020
I think they've got a good chance of doing that.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.679
We'll see, but what you're seeing now

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.990
is people moving much more quickly.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.724
Four hundred million, more than the population

of the United States.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.943
Those are the kinds of ambitions now

good decisions can bring quick results,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.913
and those two transformations,

00:10:53.913 --> 00:10:55.904
and the climate and the low carbon,

00:10:55.904 --> 00:10:58.447
are intimately intertwined.

00:10:58.447 --> 00:11:00.269
Do the first one well, the structural,
