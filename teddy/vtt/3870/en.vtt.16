00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:01.908
a few meters,

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:03.764
they stopped the buses and I had to walk.

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:05.822
This was the 1950s.

00:08:05.822 --> 00:08:09.720
I had to walk home three miles from school.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.289
Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.967
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:19.136
Good decisions can bring good results,

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:21.501
striking results, quickly.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.494
We've seen more: In London, we've
introduced the congestion charge,

00:08:24.494 --> 00:08:27.200
actually quite quickly and effectively,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.820
and we've seen great improvements

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.782
in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.
