00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.200
according to eMarketer.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.320
Now, from a logistics standpoint,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.080
density is good for deliveries.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.200
Supplying goods
to a shopping mall is easy.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.496
You can send big shipments to the shop,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.656
and people will go there, pick it up
and take it home themselves.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.336
E-commerce means we need to ship onesies

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.136
and have them home delivered.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.416
That's more expensive.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.136
It's like the difference between
having a birthday party for 20 people

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.256
or bringing a piece of the cake

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.920
to each of your 20 friends at their place.
