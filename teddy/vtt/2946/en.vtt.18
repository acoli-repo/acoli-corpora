Think about autonomous,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.296
off-the-grid houses with solar panels,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.040
with wind turbines
and waste recycling utilities,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.096
our new homes producing their own energy
and using it to also power the family car.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.216
I mean, cities have always been regarded
as being more energy-efficient,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.496
but let me tell you,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.000
repopulating the countryside
can be eco too.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.400
By now, you're probably thinking
of all the advantages of country living.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.256
