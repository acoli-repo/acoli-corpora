Today, more than half
of the world's population lives in cities.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.856
The urbanization process
started in the late 1700s

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.176
and has been increasing since then.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.256
The prediction is that by 2050,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.296
66 percent of the population
will live in cities

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.856
and the United Nations,
the World Health Organization,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.336
the World Economic Forum, are warning us,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.056

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.176
current problems in our cities,
