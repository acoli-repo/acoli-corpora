00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.576
sometimes you don't
even know who is talking.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.416
Now, we already have something
way better than static videocalls:

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.096
your average telepresence robot.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.520
I call it tablet on a stick.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:42.256
(Laughter)

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.016
You can control, you can move around,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.216
you can control what you're looking at.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.520
It's way better, but far from perfect.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.376
You know how they say

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.440
that most human
communication is nonverbal?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.736
Well, the robot doesn't
give you any of that.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.120
It looks like an alien.
