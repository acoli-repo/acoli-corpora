00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.856
the savings in the states
would exceed 500 billion dollars,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.656
and it could reduce greenhouse gases
by 54 million tons.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.936
That is the equivalent

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.040
of 10 million cars
off the streets for a whole year.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.576
But even though most people
would want to telework,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.136
current technology
makes the experience isolating.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.416
It's not comfortable.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240
It doesn't feel like being there.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.376
But that is going to change

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.696
by the convergence of two technologies:

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720
augmented reality and telepresence robots.
