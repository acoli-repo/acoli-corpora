Ironically, the city,
with its population density,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
is not always the best for that.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.776

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.416
they grow stronger.

A recent study made in the UK

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.816
by the Office for National Statistics

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.696
showed a higher life satisfaction rating

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.440
among people living in rural areas.
