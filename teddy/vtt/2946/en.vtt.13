00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.920
to each of your 20 friends at their place.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.376
But at least in the city,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.856
they live close to each other.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.120
Density helps.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.440
Now, e-commerce deliveries
in the countryside,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.800
those take forever.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.136
The truck sometimes needs to drive miles
between one address and the next one.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.880
Those are the most expensive
deliveries of all.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.616
But we already have a solution for that:

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.056
drones.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.456
A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.
