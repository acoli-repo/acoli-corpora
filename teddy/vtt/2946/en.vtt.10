00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.120
It looks like an alien.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200
But with advances in augmented reality,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.496
it will be easy to wrap the robot
in a nice hologram

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.800
that actually looks
and moves like a person.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.720
That will do it.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.416
Or else, forget the robot.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.416
We go full VR,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.760
and everybody meets in cyberspace.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.896
Give it a couple of years
and that will feel so real,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.640
you won't tell the difference.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.840
So what was the next reason
why people move to cities?
