00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.856
Now, some of these technologies

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.976
are opening new possibilities
that will radically change

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.776
the way we did things before

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.776
and in a few years,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.696
they may allow us
to enjoy the benefits of city life

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.376
from anywhere.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.616
Think about it.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.416
If you could live in a place
with a lower crime rate

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.776
and more space

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.536
and a lower cost of living

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.960
and less traffic,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.936
of course many people would want that,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.656
but they feel they don't have a choice.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440
You have to live in the city.
