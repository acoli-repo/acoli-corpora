According to a study
by Global Workplace Analytics,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.640
more than 80 percent of the US workforce
would like to work from home.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.320
And do you know how much it costs
for a company to even have an office?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.920
11,000 dollars per employee per year.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.576

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.960
would telework
even 50 percent of the time,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.856
the savings in the states
would exceed 500 billion dollars,
