(Laughter)

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.536
I did it myself.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.096
Six years ago, my wife and I,
we packed our stuff,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.056
we sold our little apartment in Spain,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.176
and for the same money
we bought a house with a garden

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.776
and little birds that come
singing in the morning.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.256
(Laughter)

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.856
It's so nice there.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.856
And we live in a small village,
not really the countryside yet.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.056
That is going to be my next move:

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.296
a refurbished farmhouse,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.520
not too far from a city, not too close.
