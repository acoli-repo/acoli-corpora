00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.296
So that's two.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.000
Now, what was the third reason
why people move to cities?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.760
A rich social life.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.336
They would need to be
in the city for that these days.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.416
Because people these days,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.816
they make friends,
they chat, gossip and flirt

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.656
from the comfort of their sofa.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.016
(Laughter)

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.456
And while wearing their favorite pajamas.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.776
(Laughter)

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.920
There are over two billion
active social media users in the world.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.856
In a way, that makes you think
like we are connected

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.096
no matter where we are.
