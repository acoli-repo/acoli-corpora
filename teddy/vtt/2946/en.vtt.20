00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.416
And now we'll make sure
to have a good spot for drones to land.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.616
(Laughter)

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.376
But hey, that's me.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.656
It doesn't have to be you,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.416
because it would seem
like I'm trying to convince somebody

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.936
to come join us in the country.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.176
I'm not.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.576
(Laughter)

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.256
I don't need more people to come.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.096
(Laughter)

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.896
I just think they will

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.280
once they realize they can have
the same benefits the city has.

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:25.696
But if you don't like the country,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.180
I have good news for you, too.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.800
Cities will not disappear.
