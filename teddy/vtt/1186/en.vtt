00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Another is to change our lifestyles.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
can actually be measured now.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This was figured out by Robin Williams
