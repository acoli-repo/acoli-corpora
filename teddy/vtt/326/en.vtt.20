00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:01.453
and that means that
the speed of communication

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.570
has finally caught up
to the speed of architecture.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:07.879
Because architecture
actually moves quite quickly.

00:10:07.903 --> 00:10:10.611
It doesn't take long
to think about a building.

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:12.788
It takes a long time to build a building,

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:15.106
three or four years,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.798
and in the interim, an architect
will design two or eight

00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:21.468
or a hundred other buildings

00:10:21.492 --> 00:10:25.183
before they know if that building
that they designed four years ago

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.085
was a success or not.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.239
That's because there's never been
a good feedback loop in architecture.
