WEBVTT

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:32.280
And we push and we push and we push

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:34.903
until we completely alienate all of you.

00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:37.153
We wear all black, we get very depressed,

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:39.338
you think we're adorable,

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.821
we're dead inside because
we've got no choice.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:44.597
We have to go to the other side

00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.736
and reengage those symbols
that we know you love.

00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:50.553
So we do that, and you're happy,

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:52.387
we feel like sellouts,

00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:54.061
so we start experimenting again

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.279
and we push the pendulum back
and back and forth and back and forth

00:04:57.303 --> 00:04:59.678
we've gone for the last 300 years,

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:01.815
and certainly for the last 30 years.
