00:14:04.337 --> 00:14:05.822
Let's be a part of this.

00:14:06.287 --> 00:14:09.153
This abundance of experimentation

00:14:09.177 --> 00:14:12.236
gives them the freedom
to run their own experiment.

00:14:14.452 --> 00:14:16.664
Everything is different now.

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:20.019
Architects are no longer
these mysterious creatures

00:14:20.043 --> 00:14:22.538
that use big words
and complicated drawings,

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:25.522
and you aren't the hapless public,

00:14:25.546 --> 00:14:29.081
the consumer that won't accept
anything that they haven't seen anymore.
