00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.058
we start experimenting with something
called deconstructivism.

00:07:02.727 --> 00:07:05.473
We throw out historical symbols,

00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:09.343
we rely on new, computer-aided
design techniques,

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:11.324
and we come up with new compositions,

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.204
forms crashing into forms.

00:07:14.228 --> 00:07:17.251
This is academic and heady stuff,

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:19.126
it's super unpopular,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.813
we totally alienate you.

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:25.024
Ordinarily, the pendulum would just
swing back into the other direction.

00:07:25.048 --> 00:07:27.380
And then, something amazing happened.

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:31.222
In 1997, this building opened.
