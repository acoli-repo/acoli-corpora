00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:31.485
and you can kind of guess what Livingston
is trying to say with this building:

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.035
children, property values and history.

00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:39.286
But it doesn't have much to do
with what a library actually does today.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.273
That same year, in 2004,
on the other side of the country,

00:03:44.297 --> 00:03:46.292
another library was completed,

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.789
and it looks like this.

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:49.331
It's in Seattle.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.694
This library is about how
we consume media in a digital age.

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:59.288
It's about a new kind
of public amenity for the city,

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:01.917
a place to gather and read and share.
