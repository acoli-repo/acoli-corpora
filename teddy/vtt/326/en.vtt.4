00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:02.093
It means that when I show you
a building like this,

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:03.499
I know what you think:

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.870
You think "power"
and "stability" and "democracy."

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.872
And I know you think that
because it's based on a building

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:13.690
that was build 2,500 years ago
by the Greeks.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:15.594
This is a trick.

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:18.080
This is a trigger that architects use

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:21.993
to get you to create
an emotional connection

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:24.658
to the forms that we build
our buildings out of.

00:02:25.237 --> 00:02:27.877
It's a predictable emotional connection,

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:31.121
and we've been using this trick
for a long, long time.
