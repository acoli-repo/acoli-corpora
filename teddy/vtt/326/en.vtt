00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:03.448
Today I'm going to speak to you

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:06.502
about the last 30 years
of architectural history.

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:10.143
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:11.854
It's a complex topic,

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:16.252
so we're just going to dive right in
at a complex place:

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.482
New Jersey.

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:20.696
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.562
and I was six, and I lived there
in my parents' house

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.210
in a town called Livingston,

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.165
and this was my childhood bedroom.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.124
Around the corner from my bedroom
