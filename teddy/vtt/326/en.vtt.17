00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:32.865
Now, how is it possible
that these forms --

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:34.794
they're wild and radical --

00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:38.657
how is it possible that they become
so ubiquitous throughout the world?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.766
And it happened because media
so successfully galvanized around them

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.587
that they quickly taught us
that these forms mean culture and tourism.

00:08:51.068 --> 00:08:54.466
We created an emotional
reaction to these forms.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.862
So did every mayor in the world.

00:08:56.967 --> 00:08:59.469
So every mayor knew
that if they had these forms,

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:02.483
they had culture and tourism.
