00:10:59.386 --> 00:11:01.755
since the invention of concrete,

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:04.233
of steel, or of the elevator,

00:11:04.257 --> 00:11:05.939
and it's a media revolution.

00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:11.732
So my theory is that when
you apply media to this pendulum,

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:14.617
it starts swinging faster and faster,

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:18.379
until it's at both extremes
nearly simultaneously,

00:11:18.403 --> 00:11:23.371
and that effectively blurs the difference
between innovation and symbol,

00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:26.770
between us, the architects,
and you, the public.

00:11:27.342 --> 00:11:33.402
Now we can make nearly instantaneous,
emotionally charged symbols
