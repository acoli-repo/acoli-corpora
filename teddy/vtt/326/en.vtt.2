00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.741
I was awkward,

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:03.856
insecure, and I hated it.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.919
I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,

00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:09.967
I hated that room, and I hated that house.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.457
And that's architecture.

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:14.234
(Laughter)

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:15.576
Done.

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:19.462
That feeling, those emotions that I felt,

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:22.179
that's the power of architecture,

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:25.741
because architecture is not about math
and it's not about zoning,

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:29.123
it's about those visceral,
emotional connections

00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:31.903
that we feel to the places that we occupy.
