00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:01.917
a place to gather and read and share.

00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:04.867
So how is it possible

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:08.304
that in the same year,
in the same country,

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:10.951
two buildings, both called libraries,

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:12.607
look so completely different?

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:19.109
And the answer is that architecture works
on the principle of a pendulum.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:22.369
On the one side is innovation,

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:26.010
and architects are constantly pushing,
pushing for new technologies,

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:29.716
new typologies, new solutions
for the way that we live today.

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:32.280
And we push and we push and we push
