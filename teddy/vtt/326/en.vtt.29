00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.713
Architects can hear you,

00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:34.841
and you're not intimidated
by architecture.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.152
That means that that pendulum
swinging back and forth

00:14:39.176 --> 00:14:42.154
from style to style,
from movement to movement,

00:14:42.178 --> 00:14:43.459
is irrelevant.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.280
We can actually move forward

00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:50.670
and find relevant solutions
to the problems that our society faces.

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:55.199
This is the end of architectural history,

00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:58.091
and it means that
the buildings of tomorrow

00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:01.278
are going to look a lot different
than the buildings of today.
