00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.113
muscular contractions in the throat
and chest

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:06.023
move air from the lungs across
the U-fold and into the laryngeal sacs,

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:08.483
causing the U-fold to vibrate.

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:14.163
The resulting sound resonates in the sacs
like a choir singing in a cathedral

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:19.194
making songs loud enough to propagate
up to thousands of kilometers away.

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:21.765
Whales don't have to exhale to sing.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:25.334
Instead, the air is recycled 
back into the lungs,

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:27.984
creating sound once more.

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:31.763
One reason whale songs are so fascinating
is their pattern.
