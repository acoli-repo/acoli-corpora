00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.057
That's why a chorus of sounds fills
the ocean.

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:32.822
Clicks,

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:33.522
pulses,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:34.544
whistles,

00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:35.431
groans,

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.281
boings,

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.080
cries,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.791
and trills, to name a few.

But the most famous parts of this
underwater symphony

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:48.111
are the evocative melodies, or songs,
composed by the world's largest mammals,

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:50.741
whales.

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.602
Whale songs are one of the most
sophisticated communication systems

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.472
in the animal kingdom.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.181
Only a few species are known to sing.

00:00:59.181 --> 00:00:59.924
Blue,

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:00.832
