00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.181
minke whales,

00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.282
and of course humpback whales.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.032
These are all baleen whales

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:12.921
which use hairy baleen plates
instead of teeth to trap their prey.

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.322
Meanwhile, toothed whales do use
echolocation,

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.182
and they and other species
of baleen whales

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:23.871
make social sounds, such as 
cries and whistles, to communicate.

00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:28.292
But those vocalizations 
lack the complexity of songs.

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:29.992
So how do they do it?

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:34.988
Land mammals like us generate sound
by moving air over our vocal cords
