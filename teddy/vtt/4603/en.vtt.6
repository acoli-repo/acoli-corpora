00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.564
And why do they do it?

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:05.155
We don't yet know the exact purpose,
but we can speculate.

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:09.315
Given that the singers are males and 
they mostly sing during the mating season,

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.266
songs might be used to attract females.

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:17.036
Or perhaps they're territorial,
used to deter other males.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:21.155
Whales return to the same feeding
and breeding grounds annually,

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:24.966
and each discrete population has
a different song.

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:31.196
Songs evolve over time as units
or phrases are added, changed, or dropped.
