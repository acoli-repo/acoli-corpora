00:03:56.406 --> 00:04:02.007
These help us track species when sightings
or genetic samples are rare.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.897
For example, scientists have been able
to differentiate

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:10.335
the elusive blue whale's populations
worldwide based on their songs.

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:14.946
But the oceans are getting noisier
as a result of human activity.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:15.676
Boating,

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:16.756
military sonar,

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.127
underwater construction,

00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:22.156
and seismic surveys for oil
are occurring more often

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:25.347
which may interfere 
with whale's communication.

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:28.667
Some whales will avoid key feeding
or breeding grounds

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.298
if human noise is too loud.
