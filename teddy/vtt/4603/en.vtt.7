00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:31.196
Songs evolve over time as units
or phrases are added, changed, or dropped.

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:35.020
And when males from different populations
are feeding within earshot,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.300
phrases are often exchanged,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.855
maybe because new songs make them more
attractive to breeding females.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.586
This is one of the fastest examples
of cultural transmission,

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:49.470
where learned behaviors are passed
between unrelated individuals

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.520
of the same species.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.507
We can eavesdrop on these songs
using underwater microphones

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:56.406
called hydrophones.

00:03:56.406 --> 00:04:02.007
These help us track species when sightings
or genetic samples are rare.
