One reason whale songs are so fascinating
is their pattern.

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:36.615
Units, like moans, cries, and chirps
are arranged in phrases.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.674
Repeated phrases 
are assembled into themes.

00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:44.553
Multiple themes repeated in a predictable
pattern create a song.

00:02:44.553 --> 00:02:47.115
This hierarchical structure 
is a kind of grammar.

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.842
Whale songs are extremely variable
in duration,

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:54.135
and whales can repeat them over and over.

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:59.954
In one recorded session,
a humpback whale sang for 22 hours.

00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.564
And why do they do it?
