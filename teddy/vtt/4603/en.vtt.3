Land mammals like us generate sound
by moving air over our vocal cords

00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:38.114
when we exhale,
causing them to vibrate.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.262
Baleen whales have a U-shaped fold
of tissue between their lungs

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:47.492
and their large inflatable organs
called laryngeal sacs.

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.705
We don't know this for sure

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.115
because it's essentially impossible
to observe the internal organs

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:55.104
of a living, singing whale,

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:57.333

muscular contractions in the throat
and chest
