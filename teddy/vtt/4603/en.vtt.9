00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.298
if human noise is too loud.

00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:34.557
And humpback whales have been observed
to reduce their singing

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.898
in response to noise 200 kilometers away.

00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:41.557
Limiting human activity
along migratory routes

00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:43.617
and in other critical habitats,

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.437
and reducing noise pollution
throughout the ocean

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:49.987
would help ensure 
whales continued survival.

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:52.838
If the whales can keep singing
and we can keep listening,

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:56.537
maybe one day we'll truly understand
what they're saying.
