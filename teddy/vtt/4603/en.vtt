Communicating underwater is challenging.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.650
Light and odors don't travel well,
so it's hard for animals to see or smell.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.840
But sound moves about four times
faster in water than in air,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
so in this dark environment,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.351
marine mammals often rely
on vocalization to communicate.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.057
That's why a chorus of sounds fills
the ocean.
