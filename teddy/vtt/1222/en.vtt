00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have had the distinct pleasure

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of living inside two biospheres.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what did I learn? Well,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then of course I have to milk the goats
