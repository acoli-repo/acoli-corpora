What do you think of when I say the word "design"?

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:06.829
You probably think of things like this,

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:10.329
finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.246
or maybe logos and posters and maps

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.163
that visually explain things,

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:18.329
classic icons of timeless design.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.204
But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:22.371
I want to talk about the kind

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.413
that you probably use every day

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:26.163
and may not give much thought to,

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:28.288
designs that change all the time

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:30.538
and that live inside your pocket.
