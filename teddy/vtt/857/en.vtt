I'm sure that,

00:00:02.154 --> 00:00:07.506
throughout the 100,000-odd years
of our species' existence

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.880
and even before,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:15.609
our ancestors looked up at the night sky
and wondered what stars are --

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.923
wondering, therefore,

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:22.587
how to explain what they saw

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.052
in terms of things unseen.

00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:34.100
OK, so, most people only wondered
that occasionally, like today,
