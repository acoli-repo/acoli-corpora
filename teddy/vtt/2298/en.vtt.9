00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
between how long a childhood a species has

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and how smart and flexible they are.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
On one side

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
is a New Caledonian crow.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
are incredibly smart birds.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And this is a bird on the cover of science

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
On the other hand,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we have our friend the domestic chicken.
