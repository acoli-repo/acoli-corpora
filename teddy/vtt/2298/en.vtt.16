00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
we should think about them

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and we're the caterpillars

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that's what they're for --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
we might expect

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And in fact, the baby's brain
