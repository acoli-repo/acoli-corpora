00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just like a baby and any other sane person.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But half the time,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So she'd act as if what she wanted

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"Can you give me some?"
