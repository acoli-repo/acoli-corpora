00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because we have to put so much time and energy

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
into just keeping them alive.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But if we turn to evolution

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for an answer to this puzzle

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of why we spend so much time

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
taking care of useless babies,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
it turns out that there's actually an answer.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
If we look across many, many different species of animals,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
not just us primates,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but also including other mammals, birds,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
even marsupials

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
like kangaroos and wombats,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
it turns out that there's a relationship

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
between how long a childhood a species has
