00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And in fact, the baby's brain

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
seems to be the most powerful learning computer

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
on the planet.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And there's been a revolution

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in our understanding of machine learning recently.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And essentially what Bayes did

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
was to provide a mathematical way

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
using probability theory

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to characterize, describe,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the way that scientists find out about the world.
