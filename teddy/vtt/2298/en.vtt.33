00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
that we might expect

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Well if we want to think about a way

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I think the best thing is think about cases

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
when we fall in love with someone new,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or when we're in a new city for the first time.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it expands,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
so that those three days in Paris

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
than all the months of being

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
