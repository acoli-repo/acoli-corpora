00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
they would just give her the crackers,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
what they thought everybody must like.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
have already discovered

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this really profound fact about human nature,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that we don't always want the same thing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to help other people get what they wanted.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Even more remarkably though,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
this deep, profound fact about human nature

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.
