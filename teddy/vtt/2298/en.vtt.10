00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
On the other hand,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we have our friend the domestic chicken.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
are basically as dumb as dumps.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and they're not much good at doing anything else.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well it turns out that the babies,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They depend on their moms

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to drop worms in their little open mouths

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
for as long as two years,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Whereas the chickens are actually mature

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
within a couple of months.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So childhood is the reason
