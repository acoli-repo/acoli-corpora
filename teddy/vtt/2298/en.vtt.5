00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"Can you give me some?"

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the question is: What would the baby give her,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what they liked or what she liked?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
just barely walking and talking,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
On the other hand,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
like they couldn't figure this out.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But then after they stared for a long time,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
they would just give her the crackers,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
what they thought everybody must like.
