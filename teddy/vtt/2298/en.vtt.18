00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the way that scientists find out about the world.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So what scientists do

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
They go out and test it against the evidence.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Then they test that new hypothesis

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and so on and so forth.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And that mathematics is at the core

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And some 10 years ago,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So if you want to know what's going on

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
