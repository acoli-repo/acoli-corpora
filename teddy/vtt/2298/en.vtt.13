00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
for much longer than the babies of any other species.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
My son is 23.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
(Laughter)

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And at least until they're 23,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we're still popping those worms

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
into those little open mouths.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
All right, why would we see this correlation?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but it has one big disadvantage.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And that one big disadvantage

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
is that, until you actually do all that learning,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you're going to be helpless.
