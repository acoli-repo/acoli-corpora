Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And adults' attention and consciousness

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
look kind of like a spotlight.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So what happens for adults

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is we decide that something's relevant or important,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we should pay attention to it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
becomes extremely bright and vivid,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and everything else sort of goes dark.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So what happens when we pay attention

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
sends a signal

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,
