00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What is going on

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in this baby's mind?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
most people, including psychologists,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
would have said that this baby was irrational,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
illogical, egocentric --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or understand cause and effect.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the last 20 years,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So in some ways,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we think that this baby's thinking

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me give you just one example of this.
