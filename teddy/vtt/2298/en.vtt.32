00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
But they're very good at taking in lots of information

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
from lots of different sources at once.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if you actually look in their brains,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So when we say that babies and young children

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
are bad at paying attention,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So they're bad at getting rid

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of all the interesting things that could tell them something

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and just looking at the thing that's important.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
that we might expect
