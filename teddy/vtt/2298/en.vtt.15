00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So one way of thinking about it

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is that babies and young children

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
are like the research and development division of the human species.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So they're the protected blue sky guys

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and we're production and marketing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We have to take all those ideas

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that we learned when we were children

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and actually put them to use.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Another way of thinking about it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is instead of thinking of babies and children

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
as being like defective grownups,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
we should think about them
