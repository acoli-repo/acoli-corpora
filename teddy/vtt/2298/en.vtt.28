but this doesn't have electricity.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Boy: It's lighting up.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So when you put four.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So you put four on this one to make it light up

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and two on this one to make it light up.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now that is a particularly --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
what they really do is do a series of experiments.
