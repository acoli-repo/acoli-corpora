00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
we've show that four year-olds are actually better

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So in these circumstances,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but after all, scientists also do experiments,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
or else "playing."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that have shown this playing around
