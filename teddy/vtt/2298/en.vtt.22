00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to wave the object on top of the detector.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They're just learning how to count.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But unconsciously,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
they're doing these quite complicated calculations

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that will give them a conditional probability measure.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the other interesting thing

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
is that they're using that evidence

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that seems very unlikely to begin with.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,
