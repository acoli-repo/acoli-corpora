00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
this deep, profound fact about human nature

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So children both know more and learn more

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
than we ever would have thought.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that's actually demonstrated it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The question you might ask though is:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Why do children learn so much?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And how is it possible for them to learn so much

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in such a short time?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they seem pretty useless.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because we have to put so much time and energy
