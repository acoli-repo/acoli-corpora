00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Other creatures, like the crows,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but they're extremely good

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
at learning about laws of different environments.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And of course, we human beings

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
by far than any other animal.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We're smarter, we're more flexible,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we can learn more,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
we survive in more different environments,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And our babies and children are dependent on us

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
for much longer than the babies of any other species.
