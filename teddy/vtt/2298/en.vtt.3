00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
one bowl of raw broccoli

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But then what Betty did

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So half the time, she acted

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just like a baby and any other sane person.
