00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me give you just one example of this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that could be going on in his mind,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And maybe the hardest thing of all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is to figure out that what other people think and feel

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Anyone who's followed politics can testify

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to how hard that is for some people to get.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We wanted to know
