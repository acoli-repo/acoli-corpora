to how hard that is for some people to get.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We wanted to know

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if babies and young children

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now the question is: How could we ask them?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Babies, after all, can't talk,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to tell you what he thinks,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000

Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
