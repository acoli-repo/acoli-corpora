4,300 years ago 
in ancient Sumer,

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:15.643
the most powerful person in the city of Ur
was banished to wander the vast desert.

00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:17.753
Her name was Enheduanna.

00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:22.410
She was the high priestess of the moon god
and history’s first known author.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.776
By the time of her exile, she had written 
42 hymns and three epic poems—

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.956
and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her.
