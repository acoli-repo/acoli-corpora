00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:31.547
as a ratio of two whole numbers.

00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.088
You can come close,

00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:35.616
but no matter how precise the fraction is,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.365
it will always be just a tiny bit off.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.678
So, to write it out in its decimal form,

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.679
you'd have an on-going series of digits

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.660
starting with

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.601
3.14159

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:47.693
and continuing

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:49.421
forever!

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:51.445
That's why, instead of trying to write out

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.728
an infinite number of digits every time,

00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:57.669
we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:59.598
Nowadays, we test the speed of computers

00:01:59.622 --> 00:02:01.615
by having them calculate pi,
