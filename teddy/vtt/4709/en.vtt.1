00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.620
that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.237
along with its diameter,

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.357
but the relationship
goes further than that.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.918
In fact, the ratio between the two,

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.212
the circumference divided by the diameter,

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:41.041
will always be the same number,

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.289
no matter how big
or small the circle gets.

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:46.588
Historians aren't sure when or how

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.300
this number was first discovered,

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:50.131
but it's been known in some form

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.082
for almost 4,000 years.

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.630
Estimates of it appear
in the works of ancient Greek,

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:56.664
Babylonian,

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:57.417
Chinese,

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.384
and Indian mathematicians.

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.313
And it's even believed to have been used
