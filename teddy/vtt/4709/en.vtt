00:00:13.823 --> 00:00:15.533
Try to measure a circle.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.438
The diameter and radius are easy,

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:18.432
they're just straight lines

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.141
you can measure with a ruler.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.682
But to get the circumference,

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:24.268
you'd need measuring tape
or a piece of string,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.517
unless there was a better way.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.684
Now, it's obvious

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.620
that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger
