00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.313
And it's even believed to have been used

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:03.340
in building the Egyptian pyramids.

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:04.921
Mathematicians estimated it

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.499
by inscribing polygons in circles.

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.147
And by the year 1400,

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:13.375
it had been calculated to as far
as ten decimal places.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.921
So, when did they finally
figure out the exact value

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:17.751
instead of just estimating?

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.010
Actually, never!

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:21.602
You see, the ratio

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.112
of a circle's circumference
to its diameter

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:26.873
is what's known as an irrational number,

00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:28.374
one that can never be expressed

00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:31.547
as a ratio of two whole numbers.
