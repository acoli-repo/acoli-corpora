00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.852
And it's not just circles, either.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.244
Because it's also useful
in studying curves,

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:36.823
pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:37.696
like clocks,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.242
electromagnetic waves,

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.950
and even music.

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.199
In statistics, pi is used in the equation

00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:46.577
to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve,

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.704
which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:50.222
of standardized test scores,

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.382
financial models,

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:54.422
or margins of error in scientific results.

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:55.751
As if that weren't enough,

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.753
pi is used in particle
physics experiments,

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:01.435
such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider,
