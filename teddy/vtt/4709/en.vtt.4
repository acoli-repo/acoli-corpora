00:01:59.622 --> 00:02:01.615
by having them calculate pi,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.354
and quantum computers have been able

00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:06.827
to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits.

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:08.090
People even compete to see

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:09.795
how many digits they can memorize

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.626
and have set records for remembering

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.130
over 67,000 of them.

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:16.899
But for most scientific uses,

00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:19.719
you only need the first forty or so.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.927
And what are these scientific uses?

00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:25.273
Well, just about any calculations
involving circles,

00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:27.077
from the volume of a can of soda

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.028
to the orbits of satellites.

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.852
And it's not just circles, either.
