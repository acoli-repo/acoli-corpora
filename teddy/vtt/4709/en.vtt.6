00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:01.435
such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.207
not only due to its round shape,

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.295
but more subtly,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.565
because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move.

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.725
Scientists have even used pi

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.232
to prove the illusive notion

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.867
that light functions as both a particle

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.201
and an electromagnetic wave,

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.116
and, perhaps most impressively,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.646
to calculate the density
of our entire universe,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.230
which, by the way,

00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:26.413
still has infinitely less stuff in it

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.937
than the total number of digits in pi.
