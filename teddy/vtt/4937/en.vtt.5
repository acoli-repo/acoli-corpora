00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:31.548
But the story reveals that 
he has his own blind spots

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:33.918
and suggests that simply recognizing evil

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:36.637
doesn’t exempt his character 
from scrutiny.

00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:40.057
Even as O’Connor probes the most 
unsavory aspects of humanity,

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:42.917
she leaves the door to redemption 
open a crack.

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.117
In “A Good Man is Hard to Find,”

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:49.117
she redeems an insufferable grandmother 
for forgiving a hardened criminal,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:51.707
even as he closes in on her family.

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.987
Though we might balk at the price the 
woman pays for this redemption,

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:57.127
we’re forced to confront the nuance
in moments

00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:00.647
we might otherwise consider 
purely violent or evil.
