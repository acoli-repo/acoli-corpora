00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:00.647
we might otherwise consider 
purely violent or evil.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.691
O’Connor’s mastery of the grotesque

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:06.581
and her explorations of the insularity and
superstition of the South

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.641
led her to be classified as 
a Southern Gothic writer.

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.976
But her work pushed beyond 
the purely ridiculous

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.956
and frightening characteristics 
associated with the genre

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:18.546
to reveal the variety and nuance 
of human character.

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:20.926
She knew some of this variety 
was uncomfortable,

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:23.316
and that her stories could be 
an acquired taste –

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:26.536
but she took pleasure 
in challenging her readers.

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:29.356
O’Connor died of lupus at the age of 39,

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:33.786
after the disease had mostly confined her 
to her farm in Georgia for twelve years.
