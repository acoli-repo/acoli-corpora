The book opens with the reluctant prophet
in a particularly compromising position:

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.327
“Francis Marion Tarwater’s uncle had been 
dead for only half a day

00:02:04.327 --> 00:02:07.588
when the boy got too drunk 
to finish digging his grave.”

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:11.308
This leaves a passerby to “drag the body 
from the breakfast table

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.308
where it was still sitting and bury it […]

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:17.158
with enough dirt on top to keep 
the dogs from digging it up.”

00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:19.178
Though her own politics are still debated,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:23.238
O’Connor’s fiction could also be attuned
to the racism of the South.

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.788
In “Everything that Rises Must Converge,”

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.738
she depicts a son raging 
at his mother’s bigotry.

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:31.548
But the story reveals that 
he has his own blind spots
