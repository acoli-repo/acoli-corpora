Technology can change our understanding of nature.

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:07.844
Take for example the case of lions.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:10.014
For centuries, it's been said that female lions

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:12.743
do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,

00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:16.724
and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:19.736
You've heard this too, I can tell.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.322
Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.994
in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.586
Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.183
on male and female lions,

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:30.791
and we mapped their hunting behavior
