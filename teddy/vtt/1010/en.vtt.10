00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
yielded striking differences

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in how well they performed.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Anglo-Americans,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they did two and a half times more anagrams

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
when they got to choose them,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
as compared to when it was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It didn't matter who did the choosing,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
if the task was dictated by another,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
their performance suffered.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
