00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is the individual.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
regardless of what other people want or recommend.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's called "being true to yourself."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But do all individuals benefit

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
from taking such an approach to choice?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in which we sought the answer to this very question.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In one study,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
into the laboratory,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we divided them up into three groups.
