00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
or to the same extent.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
When someone can't see how one choice

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
is unlike another,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,

Instead of making better choices,

It's not a marker of liberation,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
but of suffocation

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
by meaningless minutiae.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In other words,
