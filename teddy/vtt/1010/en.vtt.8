00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
into the laboratory,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we divided them up into three groups.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The first group came in,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and they even got to choose which marker

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they would write their answers with.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
When the second group of children came in,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but this time Miss Smith told them

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
which anagrams to do

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and which markers to write their answers with.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now when the third group came in,
