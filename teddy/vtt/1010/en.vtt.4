00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
she has every right to have that request met.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The American way, to quote Burger King,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is to "have it your way,"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because, as Starbucks says,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"happiness is in your choices."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But from the Japanese perspective,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Laughter)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from making the wrong choice.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they were doing their best to help me save face.
