00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
then that self, most likely,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[was] composed, not of an individual,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but of a collective.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as it was about satisfying

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
one's own preferences.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Or, you could say that

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the individual's preferences were shaped

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
by the preferences of specific others.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The assumption then that we do best

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
when the individual self chooses

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
only holds

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
when that self

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is clearly divided from others.
