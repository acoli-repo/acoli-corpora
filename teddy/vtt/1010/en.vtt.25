00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
by meaningless minutiae.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In other words,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
choice can develop into the very opposite

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
of everything it represents

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in America

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
when it is thrust upon those

of ever-increasing choice.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Americans themselves are discovering

that unlimited choice

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
seems more attractive in theory

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
than in practice.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We all have physical, mental
