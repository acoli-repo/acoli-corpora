00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the problems associated with them.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
about some of your own assumptions

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
First assumption:

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
if a choice affects you,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
then you should be the one to make it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This is the only way to ensure

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that your preferences and interests

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
will be most fully accounted for.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It is essential for success.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In America, the primary locus of choice

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is the individual.
