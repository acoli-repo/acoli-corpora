00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They'd already picked out a name for her,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Barbara, after her grandmother.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
she started to experience contractions

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and was rushed to the emergency room.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
The baby was delivered through a C-section,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
a loss of oxygen to the brain.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Unable to breathe on her own,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
she was put on a ventilator.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Two days later,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the doctors gave the Mitchells

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
a choice:

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
They could either remove Barbara
