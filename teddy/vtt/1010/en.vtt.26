00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We all have physical, mental

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and emotional (Laughter) limitations

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that make it impossible for us

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
to process every single choice we encounter,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
even in the grocery store,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
let alone over the course of our entire lives.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
A number of my studies have shown

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that when you give people 10 or more options

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
whether it be health care, investment,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
other critical areas.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yet still, many of us believe

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that we should make all our own choices
