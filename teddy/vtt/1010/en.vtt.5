00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they were doing their best to help me save face.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Americans tend to believe

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in the way they practice choice.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
best fulfills an innate and universal

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
desire for choice in all humans.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Unfortunately,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
these beliefs are based on assumptions

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that don't always hold true

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in many countries, in many cultures.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
At times they don't even hold true

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
at America's own borders.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the problems associated with them.
