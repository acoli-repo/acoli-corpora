00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
who had all faced the challenge

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of transitioning to a more

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
democratic and capitalistic society.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
One of the most interesting revelations

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
came not from an answer to a question,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
When the participants arrived for their interview,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I offered them a set of drinks:

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
seven, to be exact.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
During the very first session,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
which was run in Russia,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
one of the participants made a comment

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that really caught me off guard.
