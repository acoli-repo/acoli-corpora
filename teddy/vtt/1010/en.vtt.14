00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is clearly divided from others.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
When, in contrast,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
two or more individuals

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
see their choices and their outcomes

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
as intimately connected,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
then they may amplify one another's success

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
by turning choosing

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
into a collective act.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
To insist that they choose independently

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
might actually compromise

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
both their performance

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and their relationships.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Yet that is exactly what

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the American paradigm demands.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It leaves little room for interdependence
