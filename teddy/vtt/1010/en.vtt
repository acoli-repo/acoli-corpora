00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Today, I'm going to take you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
around the world in 18 minutes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My base of operations is in the U.S.,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but let's start at the other end of the map,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in Kyoto, Japan,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where I was living with a Japanese family

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
while I was doing part of my dissertational research

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
15 years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I knew even then that I would encounter

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cultural differences and misunderstandings,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but they popped up when I least expected it.
