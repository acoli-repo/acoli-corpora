00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now when the third group came in,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they were told that their anagrams and their markers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
had been chosen by their mothers.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
In reality,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the kids who were told what to do,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
were actually given the very same activity,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which their counterparts in the first group

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
had freely chosen.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
With this procedure, we were able to ensure

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that the kids across the three groups

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
all did the same activity,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
making it easier for us to compare performance.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity
