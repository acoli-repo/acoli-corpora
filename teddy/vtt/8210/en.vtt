00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:02.165
In the coming decades,

00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:04.250
my generation of millennials and Gen Zers

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.212
will inherit the largest amount of wealth
humanity has ever created:

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:10.214
some 30 trillion dollars.

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:12.759
That's a huge wallet.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.637
Unluckily for us, we'll also inherit
some huge issues:

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.140
climate change, geopolitical instability,

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:20.433
inequality.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:24.645
What we choose to do or not do
with this enormous wallet

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.148
will define the future of our species.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.691
No pressure, folks.
