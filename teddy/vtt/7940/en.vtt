00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:03.291
I recently graduated college

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:07.211
where I studied environmental science
and environmental sociology.

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:10.965
Now during one of my many,
many finals week study breaks,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.301
I came across something
that piqued my interest --

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:15.845
and it wasn’t something
I was supposed to be studying.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:18.514
It was a survey of 10,000 young people

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:20.266
across ten different countries

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.685
on their feelings regarding
the climate crisis.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.773
A survey found 
that 56 percent of Gen-Zers,

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:28.357
the generation that I’m a part of

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:31.486
and the largest
age demographic in the world,
