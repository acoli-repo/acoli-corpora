00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.299
and program life

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.248
opens up new horizons in cancer research,

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:35.983
and to share this vision,
I worked with artist Vik Muniz

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.799
to create the symbol of the universe,

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.440
made entirely out of bacteria
or cancer cells.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:46.645
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty
and purpose of this microscopic universe

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:51.544
can inspire new and creative approaches
for the future of cancer research.

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:54.168
Thank you.
