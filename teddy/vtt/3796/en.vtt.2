00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.181
and these molecules travel between
the thousands of individual bacteria

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.897
telling them when to turn on and off.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.148
And the bacteria synchronize
quite well at this scale,

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:11.142
but because the molecule that synchronizes
them together can only travel so fast,

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:14.718
in larger colonies of bacteria,
this results in traveling waves

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:17.620
between bacteria that are
far away from each other,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.356
and you can see these waves going
from right to left across the screen.

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:24.144
Now, our genetic program
relies on a natural phenomenon

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.317
called quorum sensing,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:28.649
in which bacteria trigger coordinated
and sometimes virulent behaviors

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.590
once they reach a critical density.
