00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.590
once they reach a critical density.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.245
You can observe quorum sensing
in action in this movie,

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.887
where a growing colony of bacteria
only begins to glow

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:40.258
once it reaches a high
or critical density.

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:42.100
Our genetic program

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.251
continues producing these
rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:47.619
as the colony grows outwards.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.310
This particular movie and experiment
we call The Supernova,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
because it looks like an exploding star.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.730
Now, besides programming
these beautiful patterns,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.321
I wondered, what else can we get
these bacteria to do?

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.900
And I decided to explore
how we can program bacteria
