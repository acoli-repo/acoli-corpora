Now, since these bacteria
specifically localize to tumors,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.478
we've been programming them
to not only detect cancer

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.266
but also to treat cancer

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.493
by producing therapeutic molecules
from within the tumor environment

00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:12.815
that shrink the existing tumors,

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.570
and we've been doing this
using quorum sensing programs

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.413
like you saw in the previous movies.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:21.110
Altogether, imagine in the future
taking a programmed probiotic

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.589
that could detect and treat cancer,

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.170
or even other diseases.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.604
Our ability to program bacteria

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.299
and program life
