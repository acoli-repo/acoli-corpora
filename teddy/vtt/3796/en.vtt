You may not realize this,

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:07.413
but there are more bacteria in your body
than stars in our entire galaxy.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.167
This fascinating universe
of bacteria inside of us

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.443
is an integral part of our health,

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:15.532
and our technology is evolving so rapidly

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:20.291
that today we can program these bacteria
like we program computers.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939
Now, the diagram that you see here,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.470
I know it looks like
some kind of sports play,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.626
but it is actually a blueprint of
the first bacterial program I developed.

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.947
And like writing software,
we can print and write DNA
