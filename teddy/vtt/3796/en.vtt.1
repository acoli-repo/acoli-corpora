00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.947
And like writing software,
we can print and write DNA

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:36.174
into different algorithms
and programs inside of bacteria.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:39.519
What this program does
is produces fluorescent proteins

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:40.957
in a rhythmic fashion

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.559
and generates a small molecule

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.137
that allows bacteria
to communicate and synchronize,

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:46.975
as you're seeing in this movie.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.785
The growing colony of bacteria
that you see here

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.778
is about the width of a human hair.

00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:54.285
Now, what you can't see
is that our genetic program

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:57.768
instructs these bacteria
to each produce small molecules,

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.181
and these molecules travel between
the thousands of individual bacteria
