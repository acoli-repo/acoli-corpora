00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.900
And I decided to explore
how we can program bacteria

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.689
to detect and treat diseases
in our bodies like cancer.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.307
One of the surprising facts about bacteria

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:11.744
is that they can naturally grow
inside of tumors.

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:13.508
This happens because typically tumors

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.923
are areas where the immune system
has no access,

00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:17.920
and so bacteria find these tumors

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.751
and use them as a safe haven
to grow and thrive.

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.585
We started using probiotic bacteria

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.209
which are safe bacteria
that have a health benefit,

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.670
and found that
when orally delivered to mice,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.826
these probiotics would selectively
grow inside of liver tumors.
