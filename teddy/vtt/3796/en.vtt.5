00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.826
these probiotics would selectively
grow inside of liver tumors.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.780
We realized that the most convenient way

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.861
to highlight the presence
of the probiotics,

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.724
and hence, the presence of the tumors,

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.953
was to get these bacteria
to produce a signal

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.069
that would be detectable in the urine,

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.481
and so we specifically
programmed these probiotics

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.360
to make a molecule that would change
the color of your urine

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.170
to indicate the presence of cancer.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.180
We went on to show that this technology

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.370
could sensitively and specifically
detect liver cancer,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.060
one that is challenging
to detect otherwise.

00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.890
Now, since these bacteria
specifically localize to tumors,
