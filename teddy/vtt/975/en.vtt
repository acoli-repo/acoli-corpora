00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here to spread the word about the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
magnificence of spiders

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and how much we can learn from them.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Spiders are truly global citizens.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can find spiders in nearly

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
every terrestrial habitat.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This red dot marks

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Great Basin of North America,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
project there with some collaborators.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here's one of our field sites,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and just to give you a sense of perspective,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this little blue smudge here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that's one of my collaborators.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a rugged and barren landscape,
