00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:03.112
Every time, they roll the dice.

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:05.504
And there's another option.

00:11:05.528 --> 00:11:07.684
Here, we're talking about CSAs:

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.960
community-supported agriculture.

00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:12.500
In this model, customers pay up front,

00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.731
bearing the financial risk for the farms.

00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:16.424
Farmers grow what they can

00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:18.790
and the customers enjoy that bounty.

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:20.863
This also has a couple issues.

00:11:20.887 --> 00:11:22.230
It's great for the farmer,

00:11:22.254 --> 00:11:24.922
because they're ensuring
that they'll sell what they buy,

00:11:24.946 --> 00:11:26.196
but for us,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.251
we still have to go
and pick up that share,

00:11:28.275 --> 00:11:31.668
and we know that a lot of farms
can't grow a huge diversity of products,
