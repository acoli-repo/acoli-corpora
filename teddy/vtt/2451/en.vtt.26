00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.621
that bothers us all so much,

00:13:00.645 --> 00:13:04.773
because we are ensuring that the supply
meets the exact demand.

00:13:05.616 --> 00:13:08.331
It also allows us to look
into the future with the farmers

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.664
and do crop planning.

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.934
So if we can say to them,
in June of this year,

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.487
"I'm going to need 400 pounds of asparagus

00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:17.069
and 500 pounds of berries every week,"

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:18.958
they can plant that accordingly,

00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:21.010
knowing with confidence
that they will sell

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:22.579
everything that they have grown.

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:25.246
And finally, we use
a route-optimization software

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.073
to help us solve the problem
of the traveling salesman.

00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:31.714
We get a fleet of workers to come in
and help us go the last mile,
