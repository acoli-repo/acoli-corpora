00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:30.072
It was planted,

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:31.548
sat in the sun

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:32.863
and then it was picked.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.108
(Laughter)

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:35.615
That's it.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.099
Like, you wouldn't want to --

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:38.889
yeah, there's not much more to that.

00:08:38.913 --> 00:08:42.529
And it traveled maybe 70 miles
to get your plate.

00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:44.386
But the difference is dramatic.

00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:48.090
I want you think about the last time
you ate a fresh, summer tomato.

00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:50.163
And I know we're all
covered in our jackets,

00:08:50.187 --> 00:08:51.338
but think about it.

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:53.554
The last time you ate
a tomato from the garden.

00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:55.307
It's warm from the sun,

00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:56.504
it's richly red,

00:08:56.528 --> 00:08:58.332
maybe it smells like dirt.

00:08:58.356 --> 00:09:01.609
There's something nostalgic
and almost magical in that experience.
