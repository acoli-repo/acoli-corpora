00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.934
This technology was spun out
by a group call Biobot Analytics,

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.530
who's creating a cutting-edge technology

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:38.717
to turn our sewers into modern-day
health observatories.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.097
Their goal is to study opioids
within the sewage

00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.756
to better understand
consumption in cities.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.718
And this data is key,

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:49.836
because it really helps cities understand
where people are using,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.734
how to allocate resources

00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:54.799
and the effectiveness
of programming over time.

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:58.419
Once again, the technology
that's built into this machine

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:00.284
is pulling back the curtain
