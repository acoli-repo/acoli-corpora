WEBVTT

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:00.284
is pulling back the curtain

00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:04.368
and showing us something about our cities
that we never would have seen without it.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.926
So it turns out, as we see,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.472
that big data is really everywhere --

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:10.739
even in your toilet.

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:14.906
And so now that we've talked
about trash and sewage,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.301
let's move on ...

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.533
to food.

00:03:17.557 --> 00:03:18.708
(Laughter)

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:22.388
A year ago, I left MIT
to pursue a passion in food,

00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:23.653
and in 2017,

00:03:23.677 --> 00:03:26.610
started a company with my husband,
called Family Dinner.

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:30.747
The goal of our company
is to create community around local food
