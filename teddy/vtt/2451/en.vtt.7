00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:30.747
The goal of our company
is to create community around local food

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:32.716
and the people who grow it.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.277
To make this happen,
we're using data analytics,

00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:37.534
automation and technology

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:40.296
to build a distributed
network of local farms

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.582
and to make improvements
on the food system.

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:44.839
So what we see here

00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:48.347
is that the broad techniques
and the mission of what we're trying to do

00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.473
is really not dissimilar
from the work at the MIT labs.

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:54.985
Which brings us to a critical question:

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.029
Why exactly would someone
leave a very promising career

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:03.246
at one of the top
urban science labs in the world
