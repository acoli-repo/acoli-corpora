Farms don't look like farms,
they look like factories.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:04.437
And at the end of the day,

00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:07.467
the quality of the food
that we're eating really suffers, too.

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:11.871
A factory-farm tomato
may kind of look like a regular tomato:

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.556
bright red exterior ...

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.996
But when you bite into it,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.570
the taste and texture
just leave you wanting.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.804
And we know that perhaps
the greatest tragedy in all of this

00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:25.860
is that between 30 and 40 percent
of this food is just wasted ...

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:28.109
thrown away.

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:30.808
That is 1.6 billion tons.
