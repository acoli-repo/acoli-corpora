This is the guy that you'll find
in sub shops, supermarkets

00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:34.734
and fast-food joints around the world.

00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:38.377
It's got a really long
and complicated backstory.

00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:43.360
It's been treated with a cocktail
of, like, a dozen pesticides

00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:47.614
and it has traveled at least
1,600 miles to get to your house.

00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:50.031
And the image here is green,

00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:53.672
because these tomatoes are picked
when green and hard as a rock,

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.057
and then they are gassed along the way

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:58.238
so that when they arrive
at the destination,

00:07:58.262 --> 00:08:01.198
they look bright and shiny
and red and ripe.
