WEBVTT

00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:02.140
and in this project, we sought to better
understand the waste-management system,

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:03.854
to answer the question

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:06.317
"Where does your trash go
when you throw it away?"

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.851
Your old coffee cup or that flip phone

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.304
that you carried around
in the early 2000s,

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.575
or a bagel or this morning's paper --

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:16.163
where do these things go?

00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:19.533
This data didn't exist,
so we had to create it.

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.419
We answered and then
visualized this question

00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:26.940
by installing small sensors
into pieces of trash

00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:29.060
and then throwing them
into the waste system.

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.400
And what you're seeing here is the data.
