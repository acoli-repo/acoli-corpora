00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:30.808
That is 1.6 billion tons.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:33.260
I can't even wrap my head
around that number.

00:05:33.284 --> 00:05:35.561
1.6 billion tons.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:39.474
That's 1.2 trillion dollars a year

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:40.771
in wasted food.

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:43.634
That is the cost of on-demand eating

00:05:43.658 --> 00:05:44.809
and convenience

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:46.600
and the broken food system.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.879
Now, where's this waste happening?

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:50.944
Where's all this waste coming from?

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:52.968
Well, we know that it happens in the field

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:55.365
when you don't pick
the sexiest-looking potatoes.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.635
We know that it happens in transit,

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.023
at the warehouses,

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:00.699
in the grocery stores.
