What the data shows us
is a highly inefficient system

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.484
whose inherent brokenness
I don't think we really would have seen

00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:09.389
had the sensors not done
the journalism for us.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.247
A second project
that I'd have to highlight

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:17.929
has to do with creating robots
that dive into sewers

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:19.574
and sample wastewater.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.001
I know that sewage kind of gets a bad rap,

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:24.870
but it's actually kind of awesome,

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.895
because it can tell us
an incredible amount

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.659
about the health of our communities.

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.934
This technology was spun out
by a group call Biobot Analytics,
