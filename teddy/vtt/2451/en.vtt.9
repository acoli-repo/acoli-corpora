00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:30.268
The current national food system
is optimized for one thing only,

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:32.760
and that's corporate profit, right?

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:34.034
And think about that.

00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:37.441
The most compelling reason
for food companies to exist

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:39.419
is not to feed hungry people,

00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:41.359
it's not to make delicious-tasting food.

00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:43.072
It's profit.

00:04:43.706 --> 00:04:47.203
And that has detrimental effects
at all levels of our food system.

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:50.786
The antibiotics and pesticides
that are being put into our food

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.824
are detrimental to our health.

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:55.986
Price pressure is forcing
small farms out of business.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.628
In fact, a lot of the things
that you think about farms

00:04:58.652 --> 00:04:59.808
no longer exist.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:03.174
Farms don't look like farms,
they look like factories.
