00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.400
And what you're seeing here is the data.

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:35.679
Every line, every node that you see

00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:39.175
is a single piece of trash
moving through the city of Seattle,

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.505
and then across the state,

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.180
and then across the country,

00:01:43.204 --> 00:01:44.946
as weeks and months go by.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.671
And it's important to visualize this data,

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:50.367
because none of you
are, probably, sitting here thinking,

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:51.649
"Yeah, that looks right."

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:53.551
(Laughter)

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.433
"That's working like it should, right?"

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:56.619
Because, no --

00:01:56.643 --> 00:01:58.113
(Laughter)

00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:02.615
What the data shows us
is a highly inefficient system
