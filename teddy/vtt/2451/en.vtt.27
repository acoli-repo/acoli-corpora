WEBVTT

00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:31.714
We get a fleet of workers to come in
and help us go the last mile,

00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:34.298
bringing all these goodies
directly to your door.

00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:35.700
Without data science

00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:38.315
and a super-capable, wonderful team,

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.044
none of this would be possible.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.450
So maybe you've seen

00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:45.827
that we've got some sort of fiery,
passionate core beliefs.

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.498
Yes, we're trying to build
a sustainable business,

00:13:48.522 --> 00:13:50.617
but our eye is not only on profit,

00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:53.450
it's on building a better,
holistic system of food.

00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:55.794
And here's what we value.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.690
People first.

00:13:57.714 --> 00:13:59.763
We're trying to build
community around food,

00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:02.316
the people who love it
and the people who grow it.
