00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:30.459
we understand that we need
to eliminate waste

00:06:30.483 --> 00:06:32.129
in the food supply chain.

00:06:32.652 --> 00:06:34.962
We need to get data
in the hands of farmers,

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.940
so that they can make better predictions.

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:39.978
So they can, you know,
kind of compete with the big guy.

00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:41.209
And then finally,

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:43.382
we need to prize, as a company,

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:46.232
quality and taste above everything,

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:49.386
so that people really value
the delicious food on their plates.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.025
This, we believe, is the better system.

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:54.512
This is the better way.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.315
And the path to that better way
is paved with data.

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:02.942
To highlight all of this,
I want to tell the tale of two tomatoes.
