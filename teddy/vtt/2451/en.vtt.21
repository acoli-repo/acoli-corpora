00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.042
And inevitably, there's some guy
playing the ukulele

00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:31.415
somewhere in the background.

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:32.439
(Laughter)

00:10:33.518 --> 00:10:37.138
But for the farmers,
this presents a lot of risk, right?

00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:38.313
You wake up at four.

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.343
You pack your truck, you hire a team,

00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:41.535
you get to your stall,

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:43.527
but you have no guarantees

00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:45.897
that you're going to move
your product that day.

00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:47.946
There's too many variables in New England.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.234
For example, the weather,

00:10:50.258 --> 00:10:53.028
which is just, like,
a little bit unpredictable here.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.656
The weather is one of the many X factors

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.941
that determine whether or not
a market will be worth it for the farmers.
