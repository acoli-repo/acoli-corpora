The field of big data seeks to analyze
massive pools of data

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.865
using computational tools
to find patterns and trends.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.576
Data can be a really
extraordinary storyteller,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.570
unveiling the hidden narratives
of things in our everyday lives

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.060
that we never would have seen.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.236
I find the personal stories of inanimate
things brought to life

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.932
to be extraordinarily compelling.

00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:52.853
I want to highlight, first,
two projects from my time at MIT

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:55.430
that I think highlight
this phenomenon really well.

00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.139
The first is called Trash Track,

00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:02.140
and in this project, we sought to better
understand the waste-management system,
