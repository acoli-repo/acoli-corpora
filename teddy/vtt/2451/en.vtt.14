00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:02.942
To highlight all of this,
I want to tell the tale of two tomatoes.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.691
We'll talk about them one by one.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.303
A tomato in itself contains
a beautiful snapshot

00:07:09.327 --> 00:07:13.113
of everything you might want to know
about the life cycle of that fruit:

00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:15.288
where it was grown,
what it was treated with,

00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:16.631
nutritional value,

00:07:16.655 --> 00:07:18.415
miles traveled to get to your plate,

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.525
CO2 emissions along the way.

00:07:20.549 --> 00:07:22.169
All of that information,

00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:24.811
all those little chapters
in one small fruit.

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:26.376
It's very exciting.

00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:29.279
This is tomato number one.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:32.747
This is the guy that you'll find
in sub shops, supermarkets
