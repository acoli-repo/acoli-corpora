00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:30.071
Luke and his family have 60 cows.

00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:32.126
They use traditional methods.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.773
They do it the old way:

00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:35.215
pasture-raised,

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:37.541
no hormones, no antibiotics,

00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:38.870
hay for days.

00:09:39.707 --> 00:09:43.763
And what they're doing here
is just treating cows like they're cows,

00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:46.055
not like they're in a science experiment.

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:48.721
He's raising animals the way
that his grandfather

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:50.586
and his grandfather would have.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.740
And at the end, it's just better.

00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:54.098
It's better for the animals;

00:09:54.122 --> 00:09:55.655
it's better for the environment.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.042
Luke is not optimizing
for profit or price,

00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:00.208
but for taste and for humanity.
