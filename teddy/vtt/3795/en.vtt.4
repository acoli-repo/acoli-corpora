00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:07.294
about where Americans have gone.

Did you know this

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:13.228
When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked
his local police department

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.657
for information about the plate
reader data they had on him,

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.335
this is what they got:

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.477
in addition to the date, 
time and location,

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:24.508
the police department had 
photographs that captured

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:27.898
where he was going and 
often who he was with.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.720
