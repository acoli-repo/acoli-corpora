00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.072
as the cost of storing
this data has plummeted,

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:02.584
the police departments
simply hang on to it,

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:06.366
just in case it could be useful someday.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.866
The issue is not just that
one police department

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.487
is gathering this information in isolation

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:14.246
or even that multiple police 
departments are doing it.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.743
At the same time, the federal government

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:20.361
is collecting all of these
individual pots of data,

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:23.682
and pooling them together 
into one vast database

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.338
with hundreds of millions of hits,

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.456
showing where Americans have traveled.
