00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.549
Also, using a device known as a StingRay,

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:35.185
law enforcement agents
can send tracking signals

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:39.550
inside people's houses
to identify the cell phones located there.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.812
And if they don't know
which house to target,

00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:43.998
they've been known 
to drive this technology

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:47.424
around through whole neighborhoods.

00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:52.060
Just as the police in Ferguson possess
high-tech military weapons and equipment,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.042
so too do police departments across
the United States

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:57.377
possess high-tech surveillance gear.

00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:59.408
Just because you don't see it,

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:01.793
doesn't mean it's not there.
