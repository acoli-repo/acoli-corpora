00:00:56.412 --> 00:01:00.022
activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food.

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:05.037
A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria.

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.512
Being cupped, rather than flat,

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:12.035
enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:13.768
Among its other uses,

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:19.488
this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators.

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:20.602
Over the millenia,

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.429
as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms,

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.453
the opening at the front grew smaller.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:31.187
The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically,
