00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.794
Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.732
Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish,

00:03:33.732 --> 00:03:38.802
have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water,

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:42.258
perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey.

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:47.465
Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.185
maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:55.715
granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:04:00.468
These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom.
