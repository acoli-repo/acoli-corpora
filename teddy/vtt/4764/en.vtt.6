We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design,

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:04.342
our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution.

00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:07.561
For example,
the human retina is inverted,

00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:11.249
with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.904
This results in a blind spot,

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.626
where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:18.382
to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back.

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:21.528
The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods,

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:23.187
which evolved independently,

00:03:23.187 --> 00:03:27.970
have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.794
Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations.
