00:03:55.715 --> 00:04:00.468
These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom.

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:04.869
So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently?

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.632
This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound.

00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:11.285
Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:15.662
to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired.

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.279
And in the not so distant future,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.200
the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.283
may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.
