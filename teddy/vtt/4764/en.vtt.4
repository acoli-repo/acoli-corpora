00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.617
allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:05.235
that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:07.435
Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:09.905
created a structure that proved useful

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:13.135
in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina.

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:17.480
It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.789
changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.681
This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.784
served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:33.193
Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris,
