Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris,

00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:36.694
that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye,

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:39.982
a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera,

00:02:39.982 --> 00:02:41.910
to maintain its structure,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.469
and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.909
But equally important

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.489
was the accompanying evolution
of the brain,

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.501
with its expansion of the visual cortex

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.157
to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:03:00.242
We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design,
