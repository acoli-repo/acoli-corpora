that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.456
seemed absurd in the 
highest possible degree.

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:42.981
And yet, that is exactly what happened,
starting more than 500 million years ago.

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.762
The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot,

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.815
such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms,

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.622
like euglena.

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:53.843
This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:56.412
linked to the organism's flagellum,

00:00:56.412 --> 00:01:00.022
activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food.
