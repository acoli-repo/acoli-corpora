00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:31.187
The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically,

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:36.464
reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye.

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:39.083
The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus,

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:45.148
uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.559
Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images,

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.487
the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.109
This is thought to have evolved

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.556
through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection,

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.617
allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid
