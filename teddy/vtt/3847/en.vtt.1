00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.715
I've got the family, spent the better part
of a day talking with them.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.731
They sort of understand what I'm on about.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.239
They think I'm a bit crazy,
but that's another story.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.609
And what's most important for me
is the beauty and the aesthetic,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.861
and that's based on the light.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.462
So the light's setting
on my left-hand side,

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:47.096
and there's a balance
in the communication with the Daasanach,

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.640
the family of 30, all ages.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.577
There's babies and there's grandparents,

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.543
I'm getting them in the tree
and waiting for the light to set,

00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:56.632
and it's going, going,
and I've got one sheet of film left,

00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:59.173
and I think, I'm okay,
I'm in control, I'm in control.

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:02.745
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
and the light's just about to go,
