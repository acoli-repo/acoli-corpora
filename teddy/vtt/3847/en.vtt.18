00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:00.226
and what they do with that hair,

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.130
they make it into a creation,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.126
a creation that's
a very personal creation.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.379
It's their creation.
It's their Huli creation.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.422
So they're called the Huli wigmen.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.279
That's a wig on his head.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.035
It's all made out of his human hair.

00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:15.573
And then they decorate that wig with
the feathers of the birds of paradise,

00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:17.821
and don't worry,
there are many birds there.

00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:21.033
There's very few people living,
so nothing to get too upset about,

00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:23.940
and they spend the rest of their life
recreating these hats

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.494
and getting further
and further,

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:27.898
and it's extraordinary,
and there's another group,

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:30.930
they're called the Kalam,
and they live in the next valley,
