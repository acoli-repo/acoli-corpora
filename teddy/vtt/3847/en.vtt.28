Chief die. What on Earth does
chief die have to do with the fence?

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.416
"Chief die.

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:06.854
First we destroy, yeah?
Then we reflect.

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:10.708
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."

00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:14.656
And I burst out in tears, because
my father had only just died

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:16.490
prior to this journey,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.161
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:22.120
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact
that I'm probably standing here today

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.233
because of him.

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:29.259
These people taught me that we are only
who we are because of our parents

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.535
and our grandparents
and our forefathers
