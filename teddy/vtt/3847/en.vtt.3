00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.580
Wait, I need the light.
Stay still! Stay still!"

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.780
And they start screaming,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.964
and then one of the men turns around
and starts screaming, shouting,

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:39.397
and the whole tree collapses,
not the tree, but the people in the tree.

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:43.017
They're all running around screaming,
and they run back off into the village

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.799
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm
left there standing behind my tripod.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.146
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,
and I can't make the picture.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.170
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.032
It took me a week, it took me a week to
make the picture which you see here today,

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.071
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)

00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.734
It's very, very, very simple --
I spent a week going around the village,
