Chukotka probably is, technically,
as far as one can go

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:04.691
and still be on the living planet.

00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:06.757
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.

00:11:06.757 --> 00:11:10.605
First you've got to get to Moscow, and
then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.

00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:13.326
And that's if you get there.

00:11:13.326 --> 00:11:15.851
As you can see, some people
sort of miss the runway.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.860
And then when you land there,
in Chukotka are the Chukchis.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.151
Now, the Chukchis are the last
indigenous Inuits of Siberia,

00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.344
and they're people I'd heard about,
I'd hardly seen any images of,

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:26.740
but I knew they were there,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.734
and I'd been in touch with this guide,

00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:29.773
and this guide said,

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:32.810
"There's this fantastic tribe.
There's only about 40 of them.
