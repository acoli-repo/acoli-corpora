00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:01.830
I was like, yeah, but that's not
my favorite picture.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.528
She went, "No no no no no no no.
It's an amazing picture.

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.581
You're in his eyes."

00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:09.120
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes?
It's a picture of the Nenets."

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.709
She said, "No, look, look closely,
you're in his eyes."

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:15.871
And when you look closely at this picture,
there is a reflection of me in his eyes,

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:19.260
so I think perhaps he has my soul,
and I'm in his soul,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.438
and whilst these pictures look at you,
I ask you to look at them.

00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:25.126
You may not be reflected in his eyes,

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:28.502
but there is something extraordinarily
important about these people.

00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:32.570
I don't ultimately have the answers,
as I've just shared with you,
