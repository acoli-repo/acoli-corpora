00:12:57.546 --> 00:13:01.980
And the last thing, it was
extraordinarily profound,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.659
and it happened only two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:08.763
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia
on the border of Angola,

00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:10.690
and I'd been there a few times before,


00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.039
and I'd gone back
to present this book I'd made,

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.960
to show them the pictures,
to get into a discussion with them,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.830
to say, "This is how I saw you.
This is how I love you.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.143
This is how I respect you. What
do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"

00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:25.216
So I wanted this debate.
It was very, very, very emotional,

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:27.657
and one night we were sitting
around the campfire,

00:13:27.657 --> 00:13:31.279
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
a little bit too much to drink,
