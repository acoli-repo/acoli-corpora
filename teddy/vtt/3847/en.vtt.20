00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:01.349
An extremely important part
of this project

00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:07.270
was about how I photograph
these extraordinary people.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.660
And it's basically beauty.
I think beauty matters.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.120
We spend the whole of our existence
revolving around beauty:

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.788
beautiful places, beautiful things,
and ultimately, beautiful people.

00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:19.808
It's very, very, very significant.

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:22.595
I've spent all of my life analyzing
what do I look like?

00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:24.332
Am I perceived as beautiful?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.705
Does it matter if I'm
a beautiful person or not,

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:28.678
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.604
And then when I went off,
I came to a very narrow conclusion.
