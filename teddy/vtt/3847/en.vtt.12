00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.169
and I had my three lessons,
and I started presenting them,

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.563
and I had this very odd
out-of-body experience.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:05.417
I sort of looked at myself
standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.233
this is complete loads of codswallop.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.417
All these people sitting here,
they've had more of these talks,

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.421

what you've learned?

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.216
Who are you to guide them
and who are you to show them

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:20.171
what is right, what is wrong,
what these people have to say?"

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.452
And I had a little bit of a,
it was very private,

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:23.770
a little bit of a meltdown.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.907
I went back, and a little bit like the boy
walking away from the tree with his goats,

00:06:27.907 --> 00:06:31.158
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,
