00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:02.745
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
and the light's just about to go,

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.426
and I want it to be golden,
I want it to be beautiful.

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:08.472
I want it to be hanging on the horizon
so it lights these people,

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:11.102
in all the potential glory
that they could be presented.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:13.151
And it's about to go 
and it's about to go,

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.776
and I put my sheet in the camera,

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:15.628
it's all focused,

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:17.913
and all of a sudden
there's a massive "whack,"

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.687
and I'm looking around,
and in the top corner of the tree,

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:22.766
one of the girls slaps
the girl next to her,

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.556
and the girl next to her pulls her hair,
and all hell breaks loose,

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:29.290
and I'm standing there going,
"But the light, the light.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.580
Wait, I need the light.
Stay still! Stay still!"
