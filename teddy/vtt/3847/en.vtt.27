00:13:27.657 --> 00:13:31.279
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
a little bit too much to drink,

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.826
and I was sort of sitting under the stars
going, "This is great,

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:37.450
you've seen my pictures,
we love each other." (Laughter)

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.592
And I'm a little bit slow,

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:42.503
and I looked around me, and I said,

00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:44.805
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.

00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:46.900
Wasn't there a fence here
last time I came?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.958
You know, this big
protective fence around the village,

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.672
and they sort of looked at me
and go, "Yeah, chief die."

00:13:52.672 --> 00:13:55.138
And I thought, okay,
chief dying, right, you know,

00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:57.529
look up at the stars again,
look at the campfire.

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:01.399
Chief die. What on Earth does
chief die have to do with the fence?
