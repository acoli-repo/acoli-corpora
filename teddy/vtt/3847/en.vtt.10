00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.464
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?
I haven't met Ted before."

00:05:01.464 --> 00:05:04.021
He said, "No, a TED Talk."
I said, "But who's Ted?

00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.343
Do I have to talk to him or do we
sit with each other on the stage?"

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:10.480
And, "No, no, the TED group.
You must know about it."

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.095
And I said, "I've been in a teepee
and in a yurt for the last five years.

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:16.428
How do I know who Ted is?
Introduce me to him."

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:19.767
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:21.666
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.140
And then eventually you're going
to go to TEDGlobal.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.274
Even more exciting.

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:28.298
But what you need to do, you need
to teach the people lessons,

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:31.350
lessons that you've learned
on your travels around the world
