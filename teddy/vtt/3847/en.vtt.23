00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:32.810
"There's this fantastic tribe.
There's only about 40 of them.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.000
You'll be okay. We'll find them."
So off we went on this journey.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.062
When we arrived there, after a month
of traveling across the ice,

00:11:39.062 --> 00:11:42.386
and we'd got to them, but then
I was not allowed to photograph them.

00:11:42.386 --> 00:11:44.955
They said, "You cannot photograph us.
You have to wait.

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:49.138
You have to wait until you get to know us.
You have to wait until you understand us.

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:52.264
You have to wait until you see
how we interact with one another."

00:11:52.264 --> 00:11:55.202
And only then, it was many,
many weeks later, I saw a respect.

00:11:55.202 --> 00:11:56.736
They had zero judgment.

00:11:56.736 --> 00:12:00.334
They observed one another, from the youth,
from the middle aged to the old.
