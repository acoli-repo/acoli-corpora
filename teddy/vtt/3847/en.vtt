00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.246
Now, I've been making pictures
for quite a long time,

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.638
and normally speaking,
a picture like this, for me,

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.565
should be straightforward.

00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:10.421
I'm in southern Ethiopia.
I'm with the Daasanach.

00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:13.532
There's a big family,
there's a very beautiful tree,

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:16.110
and I make these pictures
with this very large,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.871
extremely cumbersome, very awkward
technical plate film camera.

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:23.331
Does anybody know
4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.860
and you're setting it up,
putting it on the tripod.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.715
I've got the family, spent the better part
of a day talking with them.
