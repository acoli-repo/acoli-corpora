00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:32.298
and it was a bizarre experience,
because everybody, from everywhere:

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.629
"Who are they? What are they?
How many are they?

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.189
Where did you find them?
Are they real? You faked it.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.619
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."
Millions of questions for which,

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:42.743
to be honest, I don't have the answers.

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:44.423
I really didn't have the answers,

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:48.246
and I could sort of understand, okay,
they're beautiful, that was my intention,

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.313
but the questions that I
was being fired at,

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:52.356
I could not answer them.

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:55.189
Until, it was quite amusing,
about a year ago

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.840
somebody said, "You've been
invited to do a TED Talk."

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.464
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?
I haven't met Ted before."
