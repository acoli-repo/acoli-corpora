00:11:56.736 --> 00:12:00.334
They observed one another, from the youth,
from the middle aged to the old.

00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:02.600
They need each other.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.630

00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:27.618
This is extremely important
for the end of my talk.

00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:30.249
If you could look at somebody
left to the right of you,
