00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:31.350
lessons that you've learned
on your travels around the world

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.280
with these tribes.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.580
I thought, lessons, okay, well,
what did I learn? Good question.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.886
Three. You need three lessons,
and they need to be terribly profound.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:40.804
(Laughter)

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:43.947
And I thought, three lessons, well,
I'm going to think about it.

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:48.093
(Applause)

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.540
So I thought long and hard,
and I stood here two days ago,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.505
and I had my test run,
and I had my cards

00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:57.449
and my clicker in my hands
and my pictures were on the screen,

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.169
and I had my three lessons,
and I started presenting them,
