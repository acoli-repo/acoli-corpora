00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:30.930
they're called the Kalam,
and they live in the next valley,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.148
but they speak a completely
different language,

00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:35.620
they look completely different,
and they wear a hat,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.217
and it's built out of scarabs,

00:09:37.217 --> 00:09:39.530
these fantastic emerald green
little scarabs,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.637
and sometimes there are 5,000
or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,

00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:45.680
and they spend the whole of their life
collecting these scarabs

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.698
to build these hats.

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:50.622
So the Huli inspired me
in that they belong.

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:54.198
Perhaps I have to work harder
at finding a ritual which matters for me

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:58.679
and going back into my past
to see where I actually fit.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:01.349
An extremely important part
of this project
