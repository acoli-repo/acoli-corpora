00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:31.587
It wasn't just about turning up.
It wasn't just about shaking a hand.

00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:34.642
It wasn't about just saying,
"I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:36.812
I had to get to know
every single one of them,

00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:40.085
right down to whose boyfriend is who
and who is allowed to kiss who.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.971
So in the end, a week later,

00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.472
and I was absolutely exhausted,

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:46.243

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:47.766

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.455
They all came back.
I put them all back up in the tree.

00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:52.765
I made sure the girls
were in the right position,

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:54.930
and the ones that slapped,
one was over there.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.488
They did look at each other.
If you look at it later,

00:02:57.488 --> 00:02:59.952
they're staring
at each other very angrily,

00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:01.943
and I've got the tree and everything,
