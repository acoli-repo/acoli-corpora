It's very, very, very simple --
I spent a week going around the village,

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.803
and I went to every single one:
"Hello, can you meet at the tree?

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:07.592
What's your story? Who are you?"

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.837
And it all turned out to be
about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:12.920
I mean, I have teenage kids.
I should know.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.593
It was about a boyfriend. The girl
on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.231
and they'd started having a fight.

00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.028
And there was a very, very beautiful
lesson for me in that:

00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:23.240
If I was going to photograph these people

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.784
in the dignified, respectful way
that I had intended,

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:28.297
and put them on a pedestal,
I had to understand them.

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:31.587
It wasn't just about turning up.
It wasn't just about shaking a hand.
