and I want to put them on a pedestal,
and I said, "You have something

00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:33.080
that many people have not seen.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.735
You sit in this stunning nature."

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:38.016

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:54.140
becoming a man,
they have to shave their heads,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.262
and they spend the rest of their life
shaving their heads every single day,

00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:00.226
and what they do with that hair,
