00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:01.943
and I've got the tree and everything,

00:03:01.943 --> 00:03:04.598
and then at the last minute, I go,
"The goat, the goat!

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:08.307
I need something for the eye to look at.
I need a white goat in the middle."

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.896
So I swapped all the goats around.
I put the goats in.

00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:14.507
But even then I got it wrong, because
if you can see on the left-hand side,

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.594
another little boy storms off
because I didn't choose his goat.

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.948
So the moral being I have to learn
to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.

00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:23.461
But anyway, the effort
that goes into that picture

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:25.555
and the story that I've
just related to you,

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:26.563
as you can imagine,

00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:29.099
there are hundreds of other
bizarre, eccentric stories

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.241
of hundreds of other people
around the world.
