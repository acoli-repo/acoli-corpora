00:06:56.597 --> 00:07:00.323
It's a very, as I explained at the
beginning, very indulgent, very personal,

00:07:00.323 --> 00:07:02.654
how and why I made these pictures,

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.889
and I leave it to you as the audience
to interpret what these lessons

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.537
have meant to me, what they could
perhaps mean to you.

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:13.092
I traveled enormously as a child.

00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:15.613
I was very nomadic.
It was actually very exciting.

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:17.424
All around the world,

00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:21.300
and I had this feeling that I
was pushed off at great speed

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.763
to become somebody,
become that individual, Jimmy.

00:07:23.763 --> 00:07:26.161
Go off into the planet,
and so I ran, and I ran,

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:29.671
and my wife sometimes kids me,
"Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"

00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:32.008
but I'm, "No, it's all
about something, trust me."
