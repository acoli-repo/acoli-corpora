00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.096
They only remember you as you were,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.296
and it's a great confidence boost
to be back in touch with these people

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.960
and hear their enthusiasm
about your interest in returning to work.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.536
There's one more thing I remember vividly
from my own career break.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.935
And that was that I hardly kept up
with the business news.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.576
My background is in finance,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.016
and I hardly kept up with any news

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.976
when I was home caring
for my four young children.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.376
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760
and start talking about a company
that didn't exist anymore.
