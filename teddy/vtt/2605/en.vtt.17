00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.400
Now, why are companies embracing
the reentry internship?

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.416
Because the internship allows the employer

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.456
to base their hiring decision
on an actual work sample

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.535
instead of a series of interviews,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.296
and the employer does not have to make
that permanent hiring decision

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.120
until the internship period is over.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.536
This testing out period
removes the perceived risk

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.136
that some managers attach
to hiring relaunchers,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.816
and they are attracting
excellent candidates
