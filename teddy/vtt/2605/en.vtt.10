00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.696
We have fewer spousal
or partner job relocations.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.176
We're in a more settled time of life.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.016
We have great work experience.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.056
We have a more mature perspective.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.656
We're not trying to find ourselves
at an employer's expense.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.896
Plus we have an energy,
an enthusiasm about returning to work

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.840
precisely because we've been
away from it for a while.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.216
On the flip side, I speak with employers,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.776
and here are two concerns
that employers have

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.696
about hiring relaunchers.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.776
The first one is, employers
are worried that relaunchers

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.840
are technologically obsolete.
