when the Today Show asked me
if I could work with her

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.600
to see if I could help her
turn things around.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.616
The first thing I told Tracy
was she had to get out of the house.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.376
I told her she had to go public
with her job search

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.240
and tell everyone she knew
about her interest in returning to work.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.456
I also told her, "You are going
to have a lot of conversations

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.056
that don't go anywhere.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.336
Expect that, and don't
be discouraged by it.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.936
There will be a handful

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.800
that ultimately lead
to a job opportunity."
