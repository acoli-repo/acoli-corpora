are technologically obsolete.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.656
Now, I can tell you,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.256
having been technologically
obsolete myself at one point,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.960
that it's a temporary condition.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.656
I had done my financial analysis
so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.616
I don't know if anyone
can even remember back that far,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.856
but I had to relearn it on Excel.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.960
It actually wasn't that hard.
A lot of the commands are the same.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.816
I found PowerPoint much more challenging,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.000
but now I use PowerPoint all the time.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.616
I tell relaunchers that employers
expect them to come to the table
