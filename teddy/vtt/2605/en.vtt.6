00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.296
I'll tell you what happened
with Tracy in a little bit,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.749
but I want to share with you
a discovery that I made

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:07.496
when I was returning to work

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.616
after my own career break of 11 years
out of the full-time workforce.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.880
And that is, that people's view of you
is frozen in time.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.976
What I mean by this is,
when you start to get in touch with people

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.736
and you get back in touch
with those people from the past,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.016
the people with whom you worked
or went to school,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.776
they are going to remember you as you were

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.616
before your career break.
