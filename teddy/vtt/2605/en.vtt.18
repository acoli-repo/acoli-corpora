00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.816
and they are attracting
excellent candidates

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.680
who are turning into great hires.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.200
Think about how far we have come.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.536
Before this, most employers
were not interested

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.896
in engaging with relaunchers at all.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.416

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.976
specifically with relaunchers in mind,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.496
but you can't even apply

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.200
unless you have a gap on your résumé.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.936
This is the mark of real change,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.216
of true institutional shift,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.776
because if we can solve
this problem for relaunchers,
