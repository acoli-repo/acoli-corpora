People returning to work
after a career break:

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.016
I call them relaunchers.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.896
These are people who have taken
career breaks for elder care,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.736
for childcare reasons,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.456
pursuing a personal interest

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.680
or a personal health issue.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.536
Closely related are
career transitioners of all kinds:

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.896
veterans, military spouses,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.336
retirees coming out of retirement

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.080
or repatriating expats.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.695
