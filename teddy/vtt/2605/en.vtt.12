00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.616
I tell relaunchers that employers
expect them to come to the table

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.136
with a working knowledge
of basic office management software.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.896
And if they're not up to speed,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.296
then it's their
responsibility to get there.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.520
And they do.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.576
The second area of concern
that employers have about relaunchers

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800
is they're worried that relaunchers
don't know what they want to do.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.656
I tell relaunchers that they need
to do the hard work

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.176
to figure out whether their interests
and skills have changed

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.776
or have not changed

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.616
while they have been on career break.
