00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.256
whether it was called
an internship or not,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.616
but an internship-like experience,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.776
as a way for professionals
to return to work.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.576
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.896
start corporate reentry
internship programs.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.360
I saw a returning engineer,
a nontraditional reentry candidate,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.936
apply for an entry-level
internship program in the military,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.320
and then get a permanent job afterward.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.576
I saw two universities
integrate internships

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.640
into mid-career executive
education programs.
