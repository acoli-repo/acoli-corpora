00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760
and start talking about a company
that didn't exist anymore.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.736
So I had to resubscribe
to the Wall Street Journal

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.216
and read it for a good six months
cover to cover before I felt

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.160
like I had a handle on what was going on
in the business world again.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.536
I believe relaunchers
are a gem of the workforce,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.296
and here's why.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.136
Think about our life stage:

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.816
for those of us who took career breaks
for childcare reasons,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.816
we have fewer or no maternity leaves.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.336
We did that already.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.696
We have fewer spousal
or partner job relocations.
