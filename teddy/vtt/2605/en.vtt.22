00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.216
Tracy's temp job was a tryout,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.896
just like an internship,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.160
and it ended up being a win
for both Tracy and her employer.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.976
Now, my goal is to bring
the reentry internship concept

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.736
to more and more employers.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.576
But in the meantime,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.816
if you are returning to work
after a career break,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.856
don't hesitate to suggest an internship
or an internship-like arrangement

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.496
to an employer that does not have
a formal reentry internship program.
