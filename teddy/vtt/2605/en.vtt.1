00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.695
Returning to work
after a career break is hard

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.736
because of a disconnect
between the employers

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.656
and the relaunchers.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.656
Employers can view hiring people
with a gap on their resume

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.776
as a high-risk proposition,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.656
and individuals on career break
can have doubts about their abilities

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.256
to relaunch their careers,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.600
especially if they've been out
for a long time.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080
This disconnect is a problem
that I'm trying to help solve.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.160
Now, successful relaunchers
are everywhere and in every field.
