00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've been spending a lot of time

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
traveling around the world these days,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
talking to groups of students and professionals,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
On the one hand, people say,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"The time for change is now."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They want to be part of it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But on the other hand,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I hear people talking about fear,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a sense of risk-aversion.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but I don't know where to start.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."
