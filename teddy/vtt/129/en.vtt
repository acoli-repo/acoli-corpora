It was the middle of summer
and well past closing time

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.898
in the downtown Berkeley bar
where my friend Polly and I

00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:08.239
worked together as bartenders.

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.485
Usually at the end of our shift
we had a drink -- but not that night.

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:14.737
"I'm pregnant.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.266
Not sure what I'm going
to do yet," I told Polly.

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:21.912
Without hesitation, she replied,
"I've had an abortion."

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.624
Before Polly, no one had ever told me
that she'd had an abortion.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.336
I'd graduated from college
just a few months earlier
