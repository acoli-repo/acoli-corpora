00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:03.253
Before I get started:

00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:04.665
I'm really excited to be here

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.927
to just actually watch
what's going to happen, from here.

00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:13.400
So with that said,
we're going to start with:

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:16.466
What is one of our greatest needs,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.799
one of our greatest needs for our brain?

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:21.051
And instead of telling you,
I want to show you.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.556
In fact, I want you to feel it.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.219
There's a lot I want you to feel
in the next 14 minutes.

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:27.475
So, if we could all stand up.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.919
We're all going to conduct
a piece of Strauss together.
