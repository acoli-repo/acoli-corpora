00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.148
which is the past participle
of the word "smite."

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:03.240
And if you look this word up
in the dictionary --

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:04.288
(Laughter)

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:08.830
you will see that it can be defined
as both "grievous affliction,"

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:11.705
and, "to be very much in love."

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.060
I tend to associate the word "smite"
with a very particular context,

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:18.648
which is the Old Testament.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.308
In the Book of Exodus alone,
there are 16 references to smiting,

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:28.105
which is the word that the Bible uses
for the vengeance of an angry God.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.850
(Laughter)

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.579
Here we are using the same word
to talk about love
