00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.715
Love makes us crazy,

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.303
and it makes us sick.

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:35.156
Our hearts ache,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.186
and then they break.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:41.370
So our metaphors equate
the experience of loving someone

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.047
to extreme violence or illness.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.156
(Laughter)

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.252
They do.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:50.259
And they position us as the victims

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:53.642
of unforeseen and totally
unavoidable circumstances.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:57.270
My favorite one of these is "smitten,"

00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.148
which is the past participle
of the word "smite."
