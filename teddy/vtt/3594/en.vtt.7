00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.140
from the great philosopher,
Beyoncé Knowles.

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:33.625
(Laughter)

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.917
I fell in love for the first
time when I was 20,

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:41.120
and it was a pretty turbulent
relationship right from the start.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.664
And it was long distance
for the first couple of years,

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:49.284
so for me that meant very high highs
and very low lows.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.998
I can remember one moment in particular.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.925
I was sitting on a bed
in a hostel in South America,

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.645
and I was watching the person
I love walk out the door.
