Johnson and Lakoff suggest
a new metaphor for love:

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:04.091
love as a collaborative work of art.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:07.922
I really like this way
of thinking about love.

00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:12.550
Linguists talk about metaphors
as having entailments,

00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:16.370
which is essentially a way of considering
all the implications of,

00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:19.326
or ideas contained
within, a given metaphor.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.259
And Johnson and Lakoff
talk about everything

00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:24.435
that collaborating
on a work of art entails:

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:29.131
effort, compromise,
patience, shared goals.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.485
These ideas align nicely
with our cultural investment
