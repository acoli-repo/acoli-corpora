00:08:57.435 --> 00:09:02.055
and it tells us that love is painful
when, after a fight or a breakup,

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.689
that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:07.597
And in fact -- and maybe
you've heard this --

00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.465
neurochemically speaking,

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:12.923
going through a breakup is a lot
like going through cocaine withdrawal,

00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:15.311
which I find reassuring.

00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:16.485
(Laughter)

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:19.898
And then our culture uses language

00:09:19.922 --> 00:09:22.703
to shape and reinforce
these ideas about love.

00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:25.351
In this case, we're talking
about metaphors about pain

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.890
and addiction and madness.

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.270
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.
