WEBVTT

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:00.138
We made up.

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:02.979
We spent another mostly
happy week traveling together.

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:04.435
And then, when I got home,

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:09.443
I thought, "That was so
terrible and so great.

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.704
This must be a real romance."

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.706
I expected my first love
to feel like madness,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.510
and of course, it met
that expectation very well.

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.632
But loving someone like that --

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:25.751
as if my entire well-being depended
on him loving me back --

00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:27.868
was not very good for me

00:06:27.892 --> 00:06:29.042
or for him.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.551
But I suspect this experience of love
is not that unusual.
