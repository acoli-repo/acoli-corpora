00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:31.372
like there's a man,

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.113
he's walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:36.249
without realizing it, he crosses
over an open manhole,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:39.934
and he just plummets into the sewer below.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.038
And I picture it this way
because falling is not jumping.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.801
Falling is accidental,

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.727
it's uncontrollable.

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.276
It's something that happens to us
without our consent.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.493
And this --

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:57.084
this is the main way we talk
about starting a new relationship.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:02.103
