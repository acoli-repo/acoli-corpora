00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.270
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.

00:09:30.294 --> 00:09:33.811
Love is powerful and at times painful,

00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:36.600
and we express this
in our words and stories,

00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:39.680
but then our words and stories prime us

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.166
to expect love to be powerful and painful.

00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:47.128
What's interesting to me
is that all of this happens

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:49.875
in a culture that values
lifelong monogamy.

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.719
It seems like we want it both ways:

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:55.094
we want love to feel like madness,

00:09:55.718 --> 00:09:58.864
and we want it to last an entire lifetime.

00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:01.124
That sounds terrible.
