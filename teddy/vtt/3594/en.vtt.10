00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:02.322
some small voice in my head thought,

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.683
"Wow. That was dramatic.

00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:07.406
I must really be doing
this love thing right."

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.218
(Laughter)

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:13.762
Because some part of me
wanted to feel miserable in love.

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:17.666
And it sounds so strange
to me now, but at 22,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.835
I longed to have dramatic experiences,

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:26.057
and in that moment, I was irrational
and furious and devastated,

00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.305
and weirdly enough,

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:30.705
I thought that this somehow
legitimized the feelings I had
