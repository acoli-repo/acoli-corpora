00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:01.124
That sounds terrible.

00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:02.677
(Laughter)

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.449
To reconcile this,

00:10:05.473 --> 00:10:10.498
we need to either change our culture
or change our expectations.

00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:15.001
So, imagine if we were all
less passive in love.

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:19.788
If we were more assertive,
more open-minded, more generous

00:10:19.812 --> 00:10:23.113
and instead of falling in love,

00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:25.362
we stepped into love.

00:10:26.223 --> 00:10:28.152
I know that this is asking a lot,

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:31.650
but I'm not actually
the first person to suggest this.
