I thought that this somehow
legitimized the feelings I had

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.568
for the guy who had just left me.

00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:38.526
I think on some level I wanted
to feel a little bit crazy,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.082
because I thought that
that was how love worked.

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:44.948
This really should not be surprising,

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.426
considering that according to Wikipedia,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.723
there are eight films,

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:51.744
14 songs,

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.965
two albums and one novel
with the title "Crazy Love."

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.963
About half an hour later,
he came back to our room.

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:00.138
We made up.
