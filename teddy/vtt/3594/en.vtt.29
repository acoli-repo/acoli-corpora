00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.371
and what you're gaining
or losing in your relationship,

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:33.792
and you get to start thinking
about what you have to offer.

00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.216
This version of love
allows us to say things like,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.070
"Hey, we're not very good collaborators.
Maybe this isn't for us."

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:47.594
Or, "That relationship
was shorter than I had planned,

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:49.790
but it was still kind of beautiful."

00:14:50.836 --> 00:14:53.626
The beautiful thing
about the collaborative work of art

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.541
is that it will not paint
or draw or sculpt itself.

00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:01.009
This version of love allows us
to decide what it looks like.
