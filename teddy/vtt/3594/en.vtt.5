00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.579
Here we are using the same word
to talk about love

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:35.029
that we use to explain
a plague of locusts.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:36.081
(Laughter)

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.361
Right?

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.477
So, how did this happen?

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.492
How have we come to associate love
with great pain and suffering?

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:47.505
And why do we talk about
this ostensibly good experience

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.633
as if we are victims?

00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:52.247
These are difficult questions,

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:53.917
but I have some theories.

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.180
And to think this through,

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.832
I want to focus on one
metaphor in particular,

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:00.027
which is the idea of love as madness.
