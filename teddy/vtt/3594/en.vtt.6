which is the idea of love as madness.

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:03.795
When I first started
researching romantic love,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.580
I found these madness

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.707
The history of Western culture

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.668
is full of language that equates
love to mental illness.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.367
These are just a few examples.

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:16.734
William Shakespeare:

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:18.191
"Love is merely a madness,"

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.532

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.349
Friedrich Nietzsche:

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.876
"There is always some madness in love."

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.425
"Got me looking, got me looking
so crazy in love -- "

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.518
(Laughter)
