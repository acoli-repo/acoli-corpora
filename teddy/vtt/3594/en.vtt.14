WEBVTT

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:02.719
very closely resembled
the serotonin levels

00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:06.048
of people who had been diagnosed
with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:07.080
(Laughter)

00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:09.801
Yes, and low levels of serotonin

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:13.427
are also associated
with seasonal affective disorder

00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:14.731
and depression.

00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:17.947
So there is some evidence

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:22.319
that love is associated with changes
to our moods and our behaviors.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:26.350
And there are other studies to confirm

00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:30.064
that most relationships begin this way.
