I am a writer and I'm also
an English teacher,

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:04.412
which means I think
about words for a living.

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:08.586
You could say that I get paid
to argue that the language we use matters,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.810
and I would like to argue
that many of the metaphors we use

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.401
to talk about love --

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:16.248
maybe even most of them --

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:17.673
are a problem.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.593
So, in love, we fall.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.231
We're struck.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:24.651
We are crushed.

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:26.701
We swoon.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.983
We burn with passion.

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.715
Love makes us crazy,
