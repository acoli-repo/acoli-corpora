00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.078
it never occurred to me that I was allowed
to demand more from love,

00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:33.795
that I didn't have to just accept
whatever love offered.

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:38.104
When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --

00:12:38.128 --> 00:12:42.053
or, when 14-year-old Juliet
cannot be with Romeo,

00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:44.714
whom she has met four days ago,

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:48.548
she does not feel disappointed or angsty.

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.379
Where is she?

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:51.697
She wants to die.

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:53.387
Right?

00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:55.880
And just as a refresher,
at this point in the play,

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.212
act three of five,

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:59.057
Romeo is not dead.

00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:00.981
He's alive,
