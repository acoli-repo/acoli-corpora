If we do not create the stories,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we probably go mad.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now, a film.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
A film tells a story.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --

and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that are given to a director --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
would we get Buddhism better?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But that puts some kind of burden on me.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I have to tell a story
