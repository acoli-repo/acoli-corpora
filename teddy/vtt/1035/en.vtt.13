00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
There was a woodcutter

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And when that ax hits that piece of wood,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that's when everything will destroy

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and the Big Bang will happen again.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But all before that there was a woodcutter.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then when I would run out of that story,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I would imagine that woodcutter's universe

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So every time, I could tell my story again and again
