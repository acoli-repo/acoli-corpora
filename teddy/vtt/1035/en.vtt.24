She said, "The film's about a woman

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
coming to terms with growing older."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Psychological.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The writer said "It's about history, plot."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I said "It's about mythology,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the gods."

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So let me show you a film --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
a piece from that film --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and how a camera also --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
so this is a scene, where in my mind,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
she was at the depths of mortality.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
She was discovering what mortality actually means,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and if she is at the depths of mortality,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
what really happens.
