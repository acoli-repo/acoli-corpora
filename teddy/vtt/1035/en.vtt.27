You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Is it his?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Bess: Yes.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Raleigh: Majesty.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is not the queen I love and serve.
