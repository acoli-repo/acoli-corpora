00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and if you get five great moments

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
of great, organic stuff

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in your storytelling, in your film,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
your film, audiences will get it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and saying, "I don't know what to say."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
200 people at seven in the morning

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and everybody's saying,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And you put yourself into a state of panic

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
where you don't know, and so you don't know.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so, because you don't know,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe
