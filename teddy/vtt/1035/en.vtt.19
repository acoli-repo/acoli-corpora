00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We look for a story on the plot level,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
then we look for a story

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
on the psychological level,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
then we look for a story on the political level,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
then we look at a story

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
on a mythological level.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And I look for stories on each level.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Now, it is not necessary

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that these stories agree with each other.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
What is wonderful is,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.
