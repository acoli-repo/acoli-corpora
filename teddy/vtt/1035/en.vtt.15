00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the stories we tell ourselves are the stories

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that define the potentialities

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
of our existence.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We are the stories we tell ourselves.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So that's as wide as we look at stories.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
A story is the relationship

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that you develop between who you are,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
or who you potentially are,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We tell our stories,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and a person without a story does not exist.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So Einstein told a story
