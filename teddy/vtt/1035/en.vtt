00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
How are we going to introduce her?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I said, "I think she's dancing."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I could see everybody looked at me,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
somebody said, "Bollywood."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the third said, "Let's find another director."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I thought I had better change.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,
