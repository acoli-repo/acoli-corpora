00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
what really happens.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and why she should break away from mortality.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Remember, in the film, to me,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
both her and her lady in waiting

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
were parts of the same body,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
one the mortal self

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and one the spirit self.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So can we have that second?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000

Elizabeth: Bess?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Bess?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Bess Throckmorton?
