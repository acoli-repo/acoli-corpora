00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and I was told that

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
then it is measurable.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I said, "Please measure forever
