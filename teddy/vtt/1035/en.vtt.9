00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
why don't you show me what you want to do?"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and I follow all the time is: Panic.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Panic is the great access of creativity

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because that's the only way to get rid of your mind.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Get rid of your mind.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Get out of it, get it out.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And let's go to the universe because

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
there's something out there that is more

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
truthful than your mind,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that is more truthful than your universe.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it
