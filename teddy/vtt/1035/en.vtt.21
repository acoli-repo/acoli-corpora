and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and then Walter Raleigh

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
fell in love with her lady in waiting,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,
