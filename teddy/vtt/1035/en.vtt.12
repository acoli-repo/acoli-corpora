00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I said, "Please measure forever

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
because in school they're teaching me

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It doesn't come into my frame of reference."

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, how far does eternity go?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
What does forever mean?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I would lie there crying at night

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because my imagination could not touch creativity.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So what did I do?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
At that time, at the tender age of seven,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I created a story.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What was my story?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.
