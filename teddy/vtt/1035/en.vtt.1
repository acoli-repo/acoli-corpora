00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What are you talking about?"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I rethought the whole thing,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then we all came to a consensus.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And here was the introduction of this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
great British icon called "Elizabeth."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Leicester: May I join you, my lady?
