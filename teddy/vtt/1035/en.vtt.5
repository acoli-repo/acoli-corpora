00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and I put myself into absolute panic.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
