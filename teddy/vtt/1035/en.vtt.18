00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I have to tell a story

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in a much more elaborate way,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
but I have the potential.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's called subtext.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
When I first went to Hollywood, they said --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
if you talk about subtext.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Just talk about plot

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
what the visuals will be."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So when I look at a film,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
here's what we look for:

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We look for a story on the plot level,
