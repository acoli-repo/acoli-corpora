00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It'll survive her.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
She's in the absolute well

That's where she has to pull herself out

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
from the depths of mortality,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
come in, release her spirit.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And that's the moment where, in my mind,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But that's the moment
