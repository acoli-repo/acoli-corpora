00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:31.258
strange heads
and weird bodies.

00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:32.464
(Laughter)

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.448
And they found opportunity, proliferated,

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:39.427
and won the future
for their 60,000 living species,

00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:40.822
including you.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.465
That's why they look familiar.

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:43.927
You know their names.

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:48.112
Winning is not about random events

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:49.595
or an arms race.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:53.881
Rather, survivors went down alternative,
evolutionary pathways.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.819
Some found incredible success,

00:04:56.843 --> 00:04:59.310
while others became dead fish walking.
