00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:03.536
six times as long ago
as the last dinosaur --

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.206
to the Devonian period;

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.615
a strange world.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:11.366
Armored predators
with razor-edge jaws dominated

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.513
alongside huge fishes
with arm bones in their fins.

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:20.359
Crab-like fishes scuttled
across the sea floor.

00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:24.761
The few ray-fin relatives
of salmon and tuna

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:27.269
cowered at the bottom of the food chain.

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:31.713
The few early sharks
lived offshore in fear.
