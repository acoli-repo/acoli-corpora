00:05:00.572 --> 00:05:02.885
(Laughter)

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.516
A real scientific term.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.723
(Laughter)

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:07.915
I am now investigating

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.632
how these pathways to victory and defeat
repeat across time.

00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:16.197
My lab has already compiled thousands
upon thousands of dead fishes,

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:17.869
but many more remain.

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:19.750
However, it is already clear

00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:23.454
that your ancestors' survival
through mass extinction,

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:25.922
and their responses in the aftermath

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.878
made you who you are today.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.381
What does this tell us for the future?
