00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.918
and reduced to ones and zeros.

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:35.723
I can trawl a 500-million-year database
for evolutionary patterns.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:37.566
For example,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.337
fish forms can be captured by coordinates

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.467
and transformed to reveal
major pathways of change

00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:47.610
and trends through time.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.920
Here is the story
of the winners and losers

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.077
of just one pivotal event
I discovered using fossil data.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.972
Let's travel back 360 million years --

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:03.536
six times as long ago
as the last dinosaur --
