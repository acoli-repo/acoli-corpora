00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:02.399
Congratulations.

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:03.921
By being here,

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:05.382
listening, alive,

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:07.707
a member of a growing species,

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:10.692
you are one of history's
greatest winners --

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:15.136
the culmination of a success story
four billion years in the making.

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:17.899
You are life's one percent.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.040
The losers,

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:22.896
the 99 percent of species
who have ever lived,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.086
are dead --

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.471
killed by fire, flood, asteroids,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.796
predation, starvation, ice, heat

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.600
and the cold math of natural selection.
