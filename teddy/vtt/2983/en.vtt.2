00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.343
Will we continue to win?

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:05.233
I am a fish paleobiologist
who uses big data --

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:06.466
the fossil record --

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.720
to study how some species win
and others lose.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:11.698
The living can't tell us;

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.422
they know nothing but winning.

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:15.390
So, we must speak with the dead.

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:17.668
How do we make dead fishes talk?

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:22.678
Museums contain multitudes
of beautiful fish fossils,

00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:24.482
but their real beauty emerges

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:28.753
when combined with the larger
number of ugly, broken fossils,

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.918
and reduced to ones and zeros.
