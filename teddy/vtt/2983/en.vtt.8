00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.923
Yet they merely persisted for a while,

00:04:01.947 --> 00:04:03.994
declining without innovating,

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:06.279
becoming living fossils.

00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:08.848
They were too stuck in their ways

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:10.780
and are now largely forgotten.

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:17.525
A few of the long-suffering ray-fins,
sharks and four-legged tetrapods

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.203
went the opposite direction.

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:21.240
They became smaller --

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:23.084
living fast,
dying young,

00:04:23.108 --> 00:04:25.172
eating little
and reproducing rapidly.

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:27.654
They tried new foods,

00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:28.883
different homes,

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:31.258
strange heads
and weird bodies.
