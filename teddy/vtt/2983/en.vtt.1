00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.600
and the cold math of natural selection.

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:34.386
Your ancestors,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.960
back to the earliest fishes,

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:38.075
overcame all these challenges.

00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:41.901
You are here because
of golden opportunities

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.590
made possible by mass extinction.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:48.683
(Laughter)

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.199
It's true.

00:00:50.223 --> 00:00:53.452
The same is true
of your co-winners and relatives.

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.165
The 34,000 kinds of fishes.

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.686
How did we all get so lucky?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.343
Will we continue to win?
