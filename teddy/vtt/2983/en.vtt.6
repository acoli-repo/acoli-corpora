00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:01.103
during the Hangenberg event,
359 million years ago:

00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:03.135
an interval of fire and ice.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.511
A crowded world was disrupted
and swept away.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:10.236
Now, you might think
that's the end of the story.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.451
The mighty fell,
the meek inherited the earth,

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:13.680
and here we are.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.929
But winning is not that simple.

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:21.333
The handful of survivors
came from many groups --

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:24.303
all greatly outnumbered by their own dead.

00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:27.060
They ranged from top predator
to bottom-feeder,

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:28.384
big to small,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.381
marine to freshwater.
