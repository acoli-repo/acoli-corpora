Corey Hajim: Today, our guest
is Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal.

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:09.309
When most of us think of PayPal,
we think of buying something online

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.699
or paying a friend back
for a drink using Venmo.

00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:17.283
But PayPal has also become
a major financial services player,

00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:20.803
often acting as an alternative
to a traditional bank.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.020
During this pandemic,

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:28.095
PayPal has supported small businesses
around the world by providing loans,

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.437
waiving fees

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.231
and increasing cash back programs.
