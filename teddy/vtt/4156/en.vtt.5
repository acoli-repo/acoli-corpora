00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:32.216

00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:39.437
well before the pandemic exposed this.

00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:42.268
It's kind of like

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:45.649

You had, for instance, in the US,

00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:54.052
185 million adults in the US

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:58.109
struggling to make ends meet

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:03.895
You have over 70 million adults that are
really outside of the financial system,
