If you do that via a smartphone,

00:10:00.362 --> 00:10:04.074
I believe that not only do you save
a tremendous amount of time,

00:10:04.098 --> 00:10:06.342
because if you're outside
the financial system,

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:10.340
managing and moving money
is practically a part-time job

00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:11.590
to go and do that,

00:10:11.614 --> 00:10:15.258
so not only do you save time
and return time to individuals,

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:18.828
but you can cut the cost of transactions

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:22.664
by anywhere between 50 and 75 percent.

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:26.626
And remember that $140 billion
number that I gave you?

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.214
And that's just in the US.

00:10:29.238 --> 00:10:32.061
Imagine if you could cut that in half
