to open a PayPal account,

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:05.475
which is super-interesting.

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:08.836
I mean, do you see a time
where traditional banks don't exist

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.848
or at least play a much smaller role
in the financial services industry?

00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:17.401
DS: Well, I think the entire
financial services industry

00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:20.306
is evolving right now,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.850
and so I think banks
will always play a role,

00:11:24.874 --> 00:11:29.293
or as far into the future as I can see,

00:11:29.317 --> 00:11:30.602
but it will evolve.
