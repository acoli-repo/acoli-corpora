00:11:58.815 --> 00:12:02.553
So credit will always
be an important element.

00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:04.639
You know, most people in the world,

00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:11.387
it isn't that their cash outlays
exceed their cash intake.

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.802
It's just that they're not
evenly distributed.

00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:19.057
So there are times where your
cash outflows exceed your cash intake,

00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:24.210
and there, you need some form of credit
to make up that difference.

00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:30.402
And so I think forms of credit
will always be an important element.
