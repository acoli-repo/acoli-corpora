00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:01.230
for that branch to actually be profitable.

00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:03.900
And so, in lower income neighborhoods,

00:14:03.924 --> 00:14:06.063
branches are starting to close.

00:14:06.632 --> 00:14:10.469
So why are 70 percent of our loans
in those lower income neighborhoods?

00:14:10.493 --> 00:14:12.280
It's because we do machine learning.

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:15.988
We don't even look at FICO scores
or bureau scores.

00:14:16.012 --> 00:14:19.268
We look at a number
of different data elements.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:23.226
And so we can lend into
those lower income neighborhoods

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.140
where nobody else can,

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.121
and when we do that,

00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:32.958
the average sale of a small business
goes up by 22 percent.
