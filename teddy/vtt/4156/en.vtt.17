00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:34.469
and, in fact, what's very interesting
is, in lower-income populations,

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:39.975
there is a greater penetration
of smartphones than in higher income

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:44.739
because the smartphone
is the only device that somebody has.

00:08:44.763 --> 00:08:50.266
Higher-income individuals
may have desktops or iPads,

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.467
that kind of thing,

00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.778
but lower income can afford one device,

00:08:53.802 --> 00:08:55.658
and they choose it to be a smartphone

00:08:55.682 --> 00:08:59.923
because they can get and live their life
through that one device.

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:02.085
And think about that one device.
