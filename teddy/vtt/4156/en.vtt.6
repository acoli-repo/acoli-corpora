00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:03.895
You have over 70 million adults that are
really outside of the financial system,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.774
spending over 140 billion dollars
on high interest rates,

00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:12.088
unnecessary fees

00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:13.571
and struggling as well.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:18.600
And so I think
what this has really done --

00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:22.981
because you can't ignore 20,
25 percent unemployment rates --

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.398
it's exposed this crisis

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:30.894
and forced a lot of people into, maybe,
actions that they might not have taken
