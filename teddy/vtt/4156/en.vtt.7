00:03:36.063 --> 00:03:38.709
There are so many challenges
and so many opportunities,

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:43.425
and I think you've spoken
of this opportunity

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.332
of digital transactions
being helpful to people,

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:50.355
and obviously the trend, as you've said,

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.147
has massively accelerated and pushed us
into this world even further.

00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.899
So I'm curious:

00:03:56.923 --> 00:04:00.213
What does the world
look like without cash?
