00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.425
Thank you so much, Dan.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.582
Dan Schulman: Thanks for having me, Corey.
Pleasure to be here with you.

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:09.050
CH: Glad to see you.

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:12.326

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.987
Within a few months
of this pandemic's arrival,

00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.899
more than 30 million people
have filed for unemployment

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:21.147
in the United States alone.

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.879
These are certainly unusual circumstances,

00:01:23.903 --> 00:01:27.647
but it seems clear we were running
very close to the edge,

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.242
and now so many businesses
and their employees
