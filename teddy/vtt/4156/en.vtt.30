The tech industry has been criticized
for amassing power over society,

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:04.678
not that the banking industry
isn't criticized.

00:15:04.702 --> 00:15:09.148
But what do you say about people
who might be worried about

00:15:09.172 --> 00:15:12.775
tech companies taking on
even more influence and control

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:14.771
over what's happening in their lives?

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:16.944
DS: Yeah.

00:15:16.968 --> 00:15:23.918
Well, I think what's so important
for any company and tech companies

00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:29.698
is to respect the boundaries

00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:33.682
in terms of what consumers expect
from a company that serves them.
