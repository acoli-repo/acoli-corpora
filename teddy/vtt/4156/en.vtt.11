that you will see an acceleration
of the demise of cash.

00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.610

spent at retail.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.662
Eighty-five percent
of the world's transactions today

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.890
are done in cash still.

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:50.590

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:57.888
and that's both the advent

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.076
that's happening,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.363
as well as the shift to in-store
contactless payments, as you said,
