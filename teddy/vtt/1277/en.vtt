I'd like to ask you,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what do these three people have in common?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, you probably recognize the first person.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the Poet of the Millions competition,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and seen throughout the Arab world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In this contest

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
people have to write and recite

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,
