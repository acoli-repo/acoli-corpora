00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:05.041
I'm going to tell you about the most
amazing machines in the world

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:06.833
and what we can now do with them.

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:08.559
Proteins,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:10.833
some of which you see inside a cell here,

00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:14.316
carry out essentially all the important
functions in our bodies.

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:16.851
Proteins digest your food,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.581
contract your muscles,

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.182
fire your neurons

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:21.822
and power your immune system.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.376
Everything that happens in biology --

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.551
almost --

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:26.987
happens because of proteins.

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:31.773
Proteins are linear chains
of building blocks called amino acids.
