00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:34.475
The government district in Berlin
also contains the Reichstag --

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.310
Germany's parliament --
and the Brandenburg Gate,

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:40.275
and right next to the gate
there are other embassies,

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.696
in particular the US
and the British Embassy.

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:47.873
Although Germany is an advanced democracy,

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.858
citizens are limited
in their constitutional rights

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.275
in its government district.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.686
The right of assembly and the right
to demonstrate are restricted there.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:01.275
And this is interesting
from an artistic point of view.
