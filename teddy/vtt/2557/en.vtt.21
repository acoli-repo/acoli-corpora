00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.003
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.

00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:35.935
We should not take it for granted
to be boundlessly connected.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.992
We should start making
our own connections,

00:10:38.016 --> 00:10:42.516
fighting for this idea of an equal
and globally interconnected world.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.275
This is essential to overcome
our speechlessness

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:48.419
and the separation provoked
by rival political forces.

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:52.030
It is only in truly exposing ourselves

00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:54.920
to the transformative power
of this experience

00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:58.275
that we can overcome
prejudice and exclusion.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:10:59.453
Thank you.

00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:04.811
