00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.275
in which anyone who wanted to
would be able to participate

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.411
using any Wi-Fi-enabled device
without any hindrance,

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.356
and be able to send messages

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.460
to those listening on the frequencies
that were being intercepted.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.005
Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.678

00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:55.275
And people did communicate.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.275
Over 15,000 messages were sent.

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.051
