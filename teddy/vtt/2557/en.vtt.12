00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:02.093
What is new is how
these realities are hidden

00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:03.745
and how people are made invisible

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:07.865
in an age of global and overwhelming
communication and exchange.

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:11.430
Such makeshift settlements
are considered illegal,

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.726
and therefore those living in them
don't have a chance

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.551
of making their voices heard.

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:22.001
On the contrary, every time they appear,
every time they risk becoming visible,

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:24.735
merely gives grounds
for further persecution,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.768
expulsion and suppression.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:31.996
What interested us was how we could
come to know this hidden side.
