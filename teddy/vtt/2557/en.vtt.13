00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:31.996
What interested us was how we could
come to know this hidden side.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.409
We were searching for an interface
and we found one.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:39.696
It's not a digital interface,
but a physical one: it's a hotel.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.235
We named the project "Hotel Gelem."

00:06:42.783 --> 00:06:46.616
Together with Roma families,
we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.599
for example, in Freiburg in Germany,
in Montreuil near Paris,

00:06:49.623 --> 00:06:51.275
and also in the Balkans.

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:52.660
These are real hotels.

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.275
People can stay there.

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.275
But they aren't a commercial enterprise.

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:57.781
They are a symbol.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:02.227
You can go online and ask
