00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:31.275
we managed to reach out and work
with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,

00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.501
despite strict screening and isolation.

00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:38.166
From these contexts was born
an installation in the art space

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.275
of the Queensland University
of Technology in Brisbane.

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:45.690
On the face of it,
it was a very simple installation.

00:08:46.182 --> 00:08:49.587
On the floor, a stylized compass
gave the direction

00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:51.619
to each immigration detention center,

00:08:51.643 --> 00:08:56.275
accompanied by the distance
and the name of the immigration facility.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:00.275
But the exhibition step
came in the form of connectivity.
