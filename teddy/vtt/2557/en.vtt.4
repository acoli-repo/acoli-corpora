With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.902
we accepted the invitation
of the Swiss Embassy.

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:08.886
And we used this opportunity
to exploit the specific situation.

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.650
If people are spying on us,
it stands to reason

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:16.275
that they have to listen
to what we are saying.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.275
(Laughter)

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.299
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,
we installed a series of antennas.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.983
They weren't as sophisticated as those
used by the Americans and the British.
