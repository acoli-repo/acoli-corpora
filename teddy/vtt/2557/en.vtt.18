But the exhibition step
came in the form of connectivity.

00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:04.275
Above every floor marking,
there was a headset.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:08.915
Visitors were offered the opportunity
to talk directly to a refugee

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:11.275
who was or had been imprisoned

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.487
in a specific detention facility

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.932
and engage in a personal conversation.

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:19.782

of the art exhibition,

00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:22.433
asylum seekers felt free
to talk about themselves,

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:26.147
their story and their situation,
without fear of consequences.

00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.706
Visitors immersed themselves
in long conversations

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.483
about families torn apart,
about dramatic escapes from war zones,
