00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.039
and on the roof of the US Embassy,
security officers patrolled.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.688
Although the government district
is governed by a strict police order,

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:14.871
there are no specific laws
relating to digital communication.

00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:19.031
Our installation
was therefore perfectly legal,

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:22.252
and the Swiss Ambassador
informed Chancellor Merkel about it.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.980
We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.980

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:33.066
The antennas created an open
and free Wi-Fi communication network
