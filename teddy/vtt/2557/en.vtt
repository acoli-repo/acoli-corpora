00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.341
A year ago, we were invited
by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.388
to present our art projects.

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.133
We are used to invitations,
but this invitation really thrilled us.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:14.427
The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.419
It is the only old building
in the government district

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:20.399
that was not destroyed
during the Second World War,

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:23.191
and it sits right next
to the Federal Chancellery.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.839
No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel
than the Swiss diplomats.

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:29.839
