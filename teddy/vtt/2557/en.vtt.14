You can go online and ask
for a personal invitation

00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:06.637
to come and live for a few days
in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:10.153
eating, working and living
with the Roma families.

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.915
Here, the Roma families
are not the travelers;

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:15.234
the visitors are.

00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:18.639
Here, the Roma families
are not a minority;

00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:19.957
the visitors are.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:25.802
The point is not to make judgments,

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:28.580
but rather to find out
about the context that determines

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:31.803
these disparate and seemingly
insurmountable contradictions.
