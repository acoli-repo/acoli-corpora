BG: That's just to add
the detail to your talk.

00:11:33.223 --> 00:11:35.907
But you two traveled
to the island of Lesbos

00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:38.622
very recently, you're just back
a couple of days ago,

00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:41.054
in Greece, where thousands
of refugees are arriving

00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:43.366
and have been arriving
over the last few months.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.832

00:11:45.856 --> 00:11:49.657
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one
of the Greek islands close to Turkey,

00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:51.076
and during our stay,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.521
many asylum seekers arrived by boat
on overcrowded dinghies,

00:11:56.545 --> 00:12:00.204
and after landing, they were left
completely on their own.
