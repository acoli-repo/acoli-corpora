00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.989
We have also established
communication systems

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:05.081
in remote refugee centers
in Switzerland and Greece.

00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:08.853
They are all about providing
basic information -- weather forecasts,

00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:10.751
legal information, guidance.

00:10:11.163 --> 00:10:12.854
But they are significant.

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:14.529
Information on the Internet

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:17.283
that could ensure survival
along dangerous routes

00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:18.700
is being censored,

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:23.411
and the provision of such information
is becoming increasingly criminalized.

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.651
This brings us back to our network
and to the antennas

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.905
on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.003
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.
