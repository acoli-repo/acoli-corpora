00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.736
by recruiting more people to buy in.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.606
Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.956
to buy in and promote the scheme.

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:08.896
They are then encouraged to recruit others

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:12.116
and promised part of the money 
those people invest,

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:14.996
while the founder also takes a share.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:17.846
The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants,

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:21.946
with money from recent arrivals funneled 
to those who recruited them.

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:23.795
This differs from a Ponzi scheme,

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:25.605
where the founders recruit new members

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:28.915
and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members,

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:32.465
who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment.
