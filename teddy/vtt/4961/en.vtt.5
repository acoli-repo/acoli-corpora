00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.910
but they can be difficult to detect.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.259
They are presented as many 
different things,

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.049
including gifting groups,

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.679
investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses.

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:44.119
The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate multi-level marketing

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.089
can be particularly hazy.

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.659
In theory, the difference is that

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.239
the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.619
primarily earn compensation from selling
a particular product or a service

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.103
to retail customers,

00:02:56.103 --> 00:03:01.063
while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers.
