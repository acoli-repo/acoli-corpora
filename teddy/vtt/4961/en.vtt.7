00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:32.291
The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.641
before they actually start 
making a profit.

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:37.171
Others in their network follow 
their example,

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:39.311
and the schemes balloon in size

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:43.521
before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:46.766
Often, the victims are 
embarrassed into silence.

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:51.176
Pyramid schemes entice people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment.

00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:53.586
So when members don’t end up making money,

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:56.566
they can blame themselves 
rather than the scheme,

00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:00.326
thinking they weren’t tenacious enough 
to earn the returns promised.
