00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:32.465
who think the payments come 
from a legitimate investment.

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.445
As a pyramid scheme grows,

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.905
it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:42.225
That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:46.965
Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit.

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:49.400
The founder recruits six people to start,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.810
and each of them recruits six more.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.940
There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.490
who then each recruit 6 people—

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.150
a total of 216 new recruits.
