thinking they weren’t tenacious enough 
to earn the returns promised.

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.076
Some victims keep trying,

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.146
investing in multiple schemes,

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.636
and losing money each time.

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:08.472
In spite of all these factors,

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:11.492
there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme.

00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:13.772
Time pressure is one red flag—

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:19.232
be wary of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

00:04:19.232 --> 00:04:24.392
Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income are also suspect.

00:04:24.392 --> 00:04:28.170
And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.440
shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service.
