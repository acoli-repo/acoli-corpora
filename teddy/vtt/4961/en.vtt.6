while pyramid schemes primarily compensate
members for recruitment of new sellers.

00:03:01.063 --> 00:03:02.380
In practice, though,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.670
many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.400
for members to profit purely 
through sales.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.510
And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.320
disguise themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.790
using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.413
Many pyramid schemes also capitalize 
on already existing trust within churches,

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.611
immigrant communities, 
or other tightly knit groups.
