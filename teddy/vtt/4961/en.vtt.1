Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly,

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:36.395
becoming a global operation

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:41.145
that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.841
There was just one problem—

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:48.611
while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:52.865
the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:56.226
Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme:

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:57.556
a common type of fraud

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.826
where members make money

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.736
by recruiting more people to buy in.
