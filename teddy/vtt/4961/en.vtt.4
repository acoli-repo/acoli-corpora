00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.150
a total of 216 new recruits.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.100
By the twelfth round of recruiting,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100
the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.000
over 13 billion more people total 
to make money–

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.120
more than the entire world population.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.250
In this scenario,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.750
the most recent recruits,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.850
over 80% of the scheme’s participants,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.480
lose all the money they paid in.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.940
And in real life,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.030
many earlier joiners lose out too.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.820
Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.910
but they can be difficult to detect.
