Ray is probably best known
for articulating the idea

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:35.379
that technological change
is accelerating relentlessly.

00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:38.962
It has been for years,
and it's going to continue to accelerate,

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:42.279
culminating in this event
in the not too distant future,

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:44.279
called the Singularity,

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:49.089
when computers are suddenly
so much more intelligent than humans,

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:54.268
that all bets are off; change happens
at an unimaginable pace.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:59.633
Now, this belief which Ray has set out
in a series of compelling books,

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:04.991
has encouraged him to make a spectacular
series of predictions about the future.
