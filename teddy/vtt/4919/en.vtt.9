00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:30.518
and it analyzes those 147 predictions.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:34.008
Eighty-six percent were correct
to within one year.

00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:37.363
Some of the ones that
were wrong, the 14 percent,

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:40.736
were predictions like
we'd have self-driving cars,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.172
which is off by maybe five years,

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:46.196
so they were still directionally correct.

00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:49.902
CA: Give us a couple of examples
of the ones that you got right

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.979
at least 10 years before they happened.

00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:54.375
RK: I actually wrote them
in the mid-1990s,

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.220
so I thought you might ask that.

00:04:56.244 --> 00:04:58.601
(Laughter)

00:04:58.625 --> 00:04:59.912
So I'll just quickly --

00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:02.366
That the law of accelerating
returns would continue
