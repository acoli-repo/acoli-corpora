00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:04.018
Basically, making these physical products
into information technology.

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:07.506
And we'll have a 50 percent
deflation rate,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.601
because you can get the same computation
you could get a year ago

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:11.903
for half the price,

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:13.340
so 50 percent deflation rate,

00:07:13.364 --> 00:07:17.267
and that will attend these
nominally physical products.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:21.466
A prediction -- I would say
that in the early 2030s,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.680
we will have UBI, universal basic income,
in the developed world.

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:29.891
It will be worldwide
by the end of the 2030s,

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:32.315
and you'll be able to live
very well on that.
