Once a computer achieves
human adult levels,

00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:36.552
it very quickly soars past it
and becomes superhuman in that area.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:40.093
Once that area is basically
all of human ability,

00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:42.474
it will be able to do
the same thing there.

00:15:42.498 --> 00:15:44.903
A good example is driving a car.

00:15:44.927 --> 00:15:46.558
That's very, very complicated.

00:15:46.582 --> 00:15:47.776
It's in the real world,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.691
there's all kinds of vagaries
of things that might happen.

00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:56.164
So the strategy that Waymo,
the Alphabet subsidiary, is using,

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:59.268
is they developed software,
they tuned it by hand,

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.617
they had it drive with humans
at the wheel to take over,
