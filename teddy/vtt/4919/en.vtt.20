RK: Right, so there's
a connection to TED on that,

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:04.934
because I came here and talked
about my book "How to Create a Mind,"

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.868
and I articulated a thesis I had actually
been thinking about for decades.

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:11.744
And it's different from a big neural net.

00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:14.760
There's actually no back propagation
in the human brain,

00:10:14.784 --> 00:10:19.037
so it works differently than
these massively parallel neural nets.

00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:24.028
It's actually many modules,
each of which can recognize a pattern.

00:10:24.052 --> 00:10:25.966
And they're organized in a hierarchy,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.410
and we create that hierarchy
with our own thinking.

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:31.167
I talked about that here at TED --
