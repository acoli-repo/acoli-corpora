00:07:57.503 --> 00:08:02.840
I befriended a young woman
who was homeless

00:08:02.864 --> 00:08:05.831
and panhandling in front of Whole Foods.

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:09.386
So I said, "You should
contact you sister,"

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.727
because it became apparent
that she had a sister.

00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:13.766
And she said, "Well,
I don't have a phone."

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.944
"I'll get you a phone."

00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:17.314
And she says, "You sound
just like my therapist."

00:08:17.338 --> 00:08:18.703
(Laughter)

00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:22.205
So she actually has a therapist
provided by San Francisco.

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:25.326
Now, maybe not every city
does that, but ...

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.644
So we have kind of a disorganized
form of UBI today,

00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:33.244
that will become, I think,
standardized by the 2030s.
