00:01:59.197 --> 00:02:02.330
I started with the common wisdom,
'You cannot predict the future,"

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:06.286
and I made a very surprising
discovery, which is:

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.725
anything having to do with information

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.201
follows a perfectly
predictable trajectory,

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:13.656
and that trajectory is exponential.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.037
And our intuition about the future
is not exponential, it's linear.

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.072
The primary difference
between myself and my critics is,

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:24.896
we're looking at the same world,
and they just use their linear intuition,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.529
it's just obvious.

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:29.715
Halfway through the genome project,
one percent had been collected,

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.103
so mainstream critics said,
