00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:00.528
Why don't you do it here at Google?

00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:02.418
We've got all these great resources.

00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:04.474
You know, life begins
at a billion examples

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.657
in deep learning.

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:09.190
We have a billion examples of some things,
like pictures of dogs and cats,

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:12.704
we have lots of computers,
we have a lot of talent."

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:14.375
And so, we struck a deal,

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:18.019
and I took my first job
for a company I didn't start myself,

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:19.969
a few months later.

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:24.372
And the mission, and what Larry asked me
to do, was to create semantic search --

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:27.735
search by meaning, rather than keywords --

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:31.894
and ultimately influence search
to move in that direction.
