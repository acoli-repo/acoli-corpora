That the law of accelerating
returns would continue

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.798
for all these different
information technologies --

00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:07.841
computation, communication,
genetic sequencing.

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:11.302
People would predominantly
use mobile computing.

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.958
A lot of these seem obvious
because it's happened,

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.695
but it was not obvious in the 1990s.

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.204
Computers would have no moving parts,
disk drives would become obsolete.

00:05:21.228 --> 00:05:25.188
Books, music, movies
would become data files,

00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:28.529
distributed through wireless networks
and not physical objects.

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:33.061
Computers would routinely
have wireless internet connection,
