00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.617
they had it drive with humans
at the wheel to take over,

00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:04.473
three and a half million miles.

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:08.775
And that was enough to create
a simulator of the whole world of driving.

00:16:09.124 --> 00:16:13.624
And now they've driven simulated cars
a billion miles in the simulator.

00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:18.950
And so it's able to actually
do the same thing that AlphaZero did,

00:16:18.974 --> 00:16:21.363
by basically kind of playing itself

00:16:21.387 --> 00:16:24.230
with a very good simulation
of the world of driving.

00:16:24.577 --> 00:16:27.971
CA: But this is so stunning,
this development,

00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:29.387
in the last couple of years.

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:31.379
Everyone who I've spoken to in the field
