00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.103
so mainstream critics said,

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:34.349
"Oh, one percent, seven years,
it can take 700 years,

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:36.083
just like we said originally."

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:38.720
I said, "Oh, one percent,
we're almost done,"

00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:41.408
because one percent
to only seven doublings,

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:42.973
it had been doubling every year,

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.160
and indeed, it was finished
seven years later.

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:47.679
That's continued since the end
of the genome project.

00:02:47.703 --> 00:02:49.540
So that's the essence of the idea,

00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:54.370
and it really is
the foundation of my futurism.

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:58.254
I did it primarily to tie my own
technology projects.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.234
And that continues to be the primary goal.
