"Well, yes, there's all those
fantastic things in digital technology,

00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:36.312
but you can't eat information technology,
you can't wear it, you can't live in it."

00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:38.409
And I said, "All that's going to change.

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:41.029
We're going to have 3-D printing
printing out clothing,

00:06:41.053 --> 00:06:42.439
starting around 2020.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:46.572
We'll print out modules
we can snap together and create a house.

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:49.260
That was demonstrated recently in Asia.

00:06:50.022 --> 00:06:52.990

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:55.704
hydroponic plants for fruits
and vegetables,

00:06:55.728 --> 00:06:58.529
in vitro cloning
of muscle tissue for meat.

00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:04.018
Basically, making these physical products
into information technology.
