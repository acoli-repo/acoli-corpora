00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:30.103
For one thing, it's human nature to try
to increase things multiplicatively.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.125
If we're at one, we try to make it two.

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.022
If we're at a 1,000,
we don't try to make it 1,001,

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:39.426
we try to make it 2,000.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.504
And we create the computers of next year
with the computers of this year.

00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:46.985
So our tools are getting
exponentially better,

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.295
and that enables us to keep
that exponential going.

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:54.125
People say that exponentials
can't go on forever,

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.924
and that's true and there are limits,

00:03:55.948 --> 00:03:57.508
but they're not very limiting.

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:00.765
I mean, we'll be able to multiply
human intelligence trillions-fold
