If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead,

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:35.157
the rotated triangle would look different to the original.

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.324
In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:41.993
with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center.

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:45.639
But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries?

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.924
Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:52.350
Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.622
You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:56.908
we haven't mentioned yet:

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.573
the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body.

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.545
The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection
