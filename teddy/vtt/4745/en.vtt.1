In math and science, symmetry has a different,

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.165
and very specific, meaning.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.294
In this technical sense,

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:39.397
a symmetry is the property of an object.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.058
Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry,

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.234
from tangible things like butterflies,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.994
to abstract entities like geometric shapes.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.390
So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric?

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.794
Here's the definition:

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:56.842
a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.261
Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it.
