00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.261
Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.344
It will help to look at a particular example,

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:04.827
like this equilateral triangle.

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:07.874
If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees,

00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:09.723
around an access through its center,

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:12.808
we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original.

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.354
In this case, the object is the triangle,

00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:17.797
and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged

00:01:17.797 --> 00:01:20.513
is rotation through 120 degrees.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.633
So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:28.254
with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.208
If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead,
