00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:00.378
And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish,

00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:02.313
aerodynamic wings if you're a bird,

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:05.953
or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox.

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.730
But, what does this all have to do with evolution?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.514
Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:14.193
to figure out which animals are related to which.

00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:18.037
For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry.

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:20.157
But really what we should have said was

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:21.880
adult starfish and sea urchins.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.772
In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans.

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:27.817
For biologists, this is strong evidence

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:29.836
that we're more closely related to starfish

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.620
than we are, to say, corals,
