00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.620
than we are, to say, corals,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.876
or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:35.938
at any stage in their development.

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:38.782
One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology

00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:40.793
is reconstructing the tree of life,

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:44.210
discovering when and how the different branches diverged.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.529
Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.128
can help us dig far into our evolutionary past

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:52.531
and understand where we, as a species, have come from.
