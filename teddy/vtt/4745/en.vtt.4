00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.545
The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:06.235
by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body.

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:09.991
Biologists call this bilateral symmetry.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.996
As with all symmetries found in living things,

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.157
it's only approximate,

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:16.639
but still a striking feature of the human body.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.121
We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms.

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:22.784
Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles,

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.830
that butterfly we mentioned earlier,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.286
have this kind of symmetry,

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:29.190
as do some plants like orchid flowers.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.239
Other organisms have different symmetries,
