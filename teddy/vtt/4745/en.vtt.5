00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.239
Other organisms have different symmetries,

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.395
ones that only become apparent

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.601
when you rotate the organism around its center point.

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.833
It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.136
But when it occurs in animals,

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.397
this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.889
For instance, some sea urchins and starfish

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.417
have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry,

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:53.110
that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.194
This symmetry also appears in plants,

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:58.954
as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:02.069
Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees,
