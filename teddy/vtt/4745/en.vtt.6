Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees,

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.767
while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.406
Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all.

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:10.568
They are completely asymmetric.

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:13.796
But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries?

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:17.284
Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle?

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:18.882
Let's look at one particular group:

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:20.729
bilaterally symmetric animals.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.354
In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies,

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:26.706
and, of course, humans.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.473
The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:32.489
is that their bodies are designed around movement.
