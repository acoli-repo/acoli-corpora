00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:04.134
It is the third of March, 2016,

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.696
and I'm anxiously waiting for my wife
to deliver our firstborn son.

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.537
Seconds turn into minutes,

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.096
then hours,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.798
without a sign of a child coming through.

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:20.185
Then a midwife emerges
with a silent baby in her hands,

00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:23.739
and she runs past me
as though I'm not even there.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.612
Why is he not crying?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.069
I'm gripped with chills in my spine
as I run after her in terror.
