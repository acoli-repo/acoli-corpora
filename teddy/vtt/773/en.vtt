Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
on his first successful telephone call,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Laughter)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I just really want to thank you very much.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"What a strange, long trip."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And he should have said,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
