What if you own a hotel,

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:05.583
and one of the key principles

00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:09.120
is a commitment to treat
all employees and customers equally,

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:12.266
including on the basis
of gender and religion?

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:15.809
And then a large group
books an event at your space,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:19.145
and when you look at the booking,
you realize it's a religious group,

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.943
and one of their key principles
is that women should never leave the home

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.664
and should have no opportunities for
professional development outside of it.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:27.848

and get criticized by some,
