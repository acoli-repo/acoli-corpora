Kantabai said, "I want
to open a saving account.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.520
I want to save."

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.096
I asked Kantabai:

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.576
"You are doing business of blacksmith.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.576
Do you have enough money to save?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.976
You are staying on the street.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.256
Can you save?"

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.216
Kantabai was insistent.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.456
She said, "I want to save
because I want to buy a plastic sheet

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.136
before the monsoons arrive.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.720
I want to save my family from rain."

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.416
I went with Kantabai to the bank.
