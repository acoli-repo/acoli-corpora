Recently, we starting digital banking.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.936
Digital banking required
to remember a PIN number.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.576
Our women said,
"We don't want a PIN number.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.256
That's not a good idea."

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.816
And we tried to explain to them

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.336
that maybe you should
remember the PIN number;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.696
we will help you
to remember the PIN number.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.936
They were firm.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.776
They said, "suggest something else,"

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.016
and they --

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.896
(Laughter)

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.280
and they said, "What about thumb?"

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.656
I thought that's a great idea.
