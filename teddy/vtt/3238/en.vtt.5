00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.416
I went with Kantabai to the bank.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.456
Kantabai wanted to save 10 rupees a day --

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.640
less than 15 cents.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.976
Bank manager refused to open
the account of Kantabai.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.936
He said Kantabai's amount is too small

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.560
and it's not worth his time.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.656
Kantabai was not asking
any loan from the bank.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.016
She was not asking any subsidy
or grant from the government.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.976
What she was asking
was to have a safe place

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.096
to save her hard-earned money.
