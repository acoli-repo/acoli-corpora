00:05:56.665 --> 00:06:00.845
they take one picture
about every 200 milliseconds,

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:03.979
the average time an eye movement is made.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.529
So by age three, a child would have seen
hundreds of millions of pictures

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.363
of the real world.

00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:13.643
That's a lot of training examples.

00:06:14.383 --> 00:06:20.372
So instead of focusing solely
on better and better algorithms,

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:25.644
my insight was to give the algorithms
the kind of training data

00:06:25.644 --> 00:06:28.963
that a child was given through experiences

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:32.841
in both quantity and quality.
