00:13:28.877 --> 00:13:31.733
as well as natural language sentences

00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:35.055
generated by humans.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.908
Just like the brain integrates
vision and language,

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:44.109
we developed a model
that connects parts of visual things

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:46.013
like visual snippets

00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:50.216
with words and phrases in sentences.

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:52.979
About four months ago,

00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:55.626
we finally tied all this together

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:59.410
and produced one of the first
computer vision models

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.404
that is capable of generating
a human-like sentence
