00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.066
because our smartest 
machines are still blind.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.452
"Why is this so hard?" you may ask.

00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.145
Cameras can take pictures like this one

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:41.139
by converting lights into
a two-dimensional array of numbers

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.789
known as pixels,

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.040
but these are just lifeless numbers.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.151
They do not carry meaning in themselves.

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.494
Just like to hear is not
the same as to listen,

00:02:52.494 --> 00:02:56.534
to take pictures is not
the same as to see,

00:02:56.534 --> 00:03:00.363
and by seeing,
we really mean understanding.
