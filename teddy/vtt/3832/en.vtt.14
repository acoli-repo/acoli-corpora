00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.634
We went to the Internet,

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:05.070
the biggest treasure trove of pictures
that humans have ever created.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.111
We downloaded nearly a billion images

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:13.991
and used crowdsourcing technology
like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.330
to help us to label these images.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.230
At its peak, ImageNet was one of
the biggest employers

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.226
of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:28.080
together, almost 50,000 workers

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.120
from 167 countries around the world
