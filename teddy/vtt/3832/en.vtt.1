00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.194
She might still have a lot
to learn about this world,

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:34.743
but she's already an expert
at one very important task:

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.589
to make sense of what she sees.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.455
Our society is more
technologically advanced than ever.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.084
We send people to the moon,
we make phones that talk to us

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:51.030
or customize radio stations
that can play only music we like.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.085
Yet, our most advanced
machines and computers

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:57.988
still struggle at this task.

00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:01.447
So I'm here today
to give you a progress report
