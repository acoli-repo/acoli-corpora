00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:04.602
Just like the brain consists
of billions of highly connected neurons,

00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:08.456
a basic operating unit in a neural network

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.871
is a neuron-like node.

00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:13.425
It takes input from other nodes

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:16.143
and sends output to others.

00:10:16.143 --> 00:10:20.856
Moreover, these hundreds of thousands
or even millions of nodes

00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:24.083
are organized in hierarchical layers,

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:26.637
also similar to the brain.

00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:31.420
In a typical neural network we use
to train our object recognition model,
