00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:33.045
like a man, a skateboard,
railings, a lampost, and so on.

00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:38.338
Sometimes, when the computer
is not so confident about what it sees,

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.774
we have taught it to be smart enough

00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:45.652
to give us a safe answer
instead of committing too much,

00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:48.463
just like we would do,

00:11:48.463 --> 00:11:53.129
but other times our computer algorithm
is remarkable at telling us

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.382
what exactly the objects are,

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.818
like the make, model, year of the cars.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:04.204
We applied this algorithm to millions
of Google Street View images
