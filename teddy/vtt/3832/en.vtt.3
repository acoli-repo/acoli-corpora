00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.805
We have made fabulous megapixel cameras,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.940
but we have not delivered
sight to the blind.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.725
Drones can fly over massive land,

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.859
but don't have enough vision technology

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.320
to help us to track
the changes of the rainforests.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.270
Security cameras are everywhere,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.337
but they do not alert us when a child
is drowning in a swimming pool.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:59.762
Photos and videos are becoming
an integral part of global life.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:03.849
They're being generated at a pace
that's far beyond what any human,
