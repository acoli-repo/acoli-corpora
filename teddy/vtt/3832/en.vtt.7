00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:31.347
So for 15 years now, starting
from my Ph.D. at Caltech

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:34.273
and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:38.669
I've been working with my mentors,
collaborators and students

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.558
to teach computers to see.

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:45.952
Our research field is called
computer vision and machine learning.

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:49.830
It's part of the general field
of artificial intelligence.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.493
So ultimately, we want to teach
the machines to see just like we do:

00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:01.880
naming objects, identifying people,
inferring 3D geometry of things,
