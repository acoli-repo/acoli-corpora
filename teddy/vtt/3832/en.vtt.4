00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:03.849
They're being generated at a pace
that's far beyond what any human,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.632
or teams of humans, could hope to view,

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:10.553
and you and I are contributing
to that at this TED.

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:15.785
Yet our most advanced software
is still struggling at understanding

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.661
and managing this enormous content.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.933
So in other words,
collectively as a society,

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:26.679
we're very much blind,

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.066
because our smartest 
machines are still blind.
