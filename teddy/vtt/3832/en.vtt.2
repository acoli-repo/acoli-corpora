00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:01.447
So I'm here today
to give you a progress report

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:05.494
on the latest advances
in our research in computer vision,

00:01:05.494 --> 00:01:09.655
one of the most frontier
and potentially revolutionary

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.861
technologies in computer science.

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:17.412
Yes, we have prototyped cars
that can drive by themselves,

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:21.265
but without smart vision,
they cannot really tell the difference

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.235
between a crumpled paper bag
on the road, which can be run over,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:28.575
and a rock that size,
which should be avoided.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.805
We have made fabulous megapixel cameras,
