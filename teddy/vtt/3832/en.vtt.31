or even tell us a simple story
when seeing a picture.

00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:51.574
(Video) Computer: A person sitting
at a table with a cake.

00:15:51.574 --> 00:15:54.204
FFL: But there's so much more 
to this picture

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.474

What the computer doesn't see
is that this is a special Italian cake
