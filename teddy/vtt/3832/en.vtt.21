00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:31.420
In a typical neural network we use
to train our object recognition model,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.601
it has 24 million nodes,

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.898
140 million parameters,

00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:40.661
and 15 billion connections.

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:43.076
That's an enormous model.

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:46.977
Powered by the massive data from ImageNet

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:52.410
and the modern CPUs and GPUs
to train such a humongous model,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.779
the convolutional neural network

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.215
blossomed in a way that no one expected.

00:10:58.215 --> 00:11:00.723
It became the winning architecture
