00:10:58.215 --> 00:11:00.723
It became the winning architecture

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:06.063
to generate exciting new results
in object recognition.

00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:08.873
This is a computer telling us

00:11:08.873 --> 00:11:11.173
this picture contains a cat

00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:13.076
and where the cat is.

00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:15.188
Of course there are more things than cats,

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:17.626
so here's a computer algorithm telling us

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:20.900
the picture contains
a boy and a teddy bear;

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.266
a dog, a person, and a small kite
in the background;

00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:28.401
or a picture of very busy things

00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:33.045
like a man, a skateboard,
railings, a lampost, and so on.
