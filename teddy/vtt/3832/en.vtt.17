00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.098
So we carried on.

00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:34.813
In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:38.855
a database of 15 million images

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:43.660
across 22,000 classes
of objects and things

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.980
organized by everyday English words.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.906
In both quantity and quality,

00:08:49.906 --> 00:08:52.878
this was an unprecedented scale.

00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:56.339
As an example, in the case of cats,

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.148
we have more than 62,000 cats

00:08:59.148 --> 00:09:03.258
of all kinds of looks and poses
