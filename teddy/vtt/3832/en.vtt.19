00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:33.954
Now that we have the data
to nourish our computer brain,

00:09:33.954 --> 00:09:37.691
we're ready to come back
to the algorithms themselves.

00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:42.869
As it turned out, the wealth
of information provided by ImageNet

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:47.675
was a perfect match to a particular class
of machine learning algorithms

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:50.090
called convolutional neural network,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.338
pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima,
Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:58.983
back in the 1970s and '80s.

00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:04.602
Just like the brain consists
of billions of highly connected neurons,
