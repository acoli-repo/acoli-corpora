00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.839
two pointy ears, and a long tail,

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.249
and that looked all fine.

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:04.972
But what about this cat?

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.063
(Laughter)

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:07.689
It's all curled up.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.408
Now you have to add another shape
and viewpoint to the object model.

00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:14.123
But what if cats are hidden?

00:05:15.143 --> 00:05:17.362
What about these silly cats?

00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:21.529
Now you get my point.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.896
Even something as simple
as a household pet

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:29.400
can present an infinite number
of variations to the object model,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.633
and that's just one object.
