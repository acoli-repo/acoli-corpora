and by seeing,
we really mean understanding.

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:07.470
In fact, it took Mother Nature
540 million years of hard work

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.443
to do this task,

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:11.324
and much of that effort

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:16.595
went into developing the visual
processing apparatus of our brains,

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.242
not the eyes themselves.

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:21.989
So vision begins with the eyes,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.507
