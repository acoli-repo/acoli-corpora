00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:30.340
In its simplest terms,
imagine this teaching process

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.335
as showing the computers
some training images

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:36.656
of a particular object, let's say cats,

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:41.393
and designing a model that learns
from these training images.

00:04:41.393 --> 00:04:43.437
How hard can this be?

00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:47.489
After all, a cat is just
a collection of shapes and colors,

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.575
and this is what we did
in the early days of object modeling.

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:55.197
We'd tell the computer algorithm
in a mathematical language

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:58.540
that a cat has a round face,
a chubby body,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.839
two pointy ears, and a long tail,
