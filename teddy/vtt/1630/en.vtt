This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
She said, "Be good to your friends.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is one of her songs.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.
