And instead of that large
single LED portrait

00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:02.718
that was broadcasting
to the back of the stadium,

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:05.036
in this case, every member of the audience

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.305
gets to take their own portrait
home with them,

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:09.791
and it's woven in with the words

00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:12.608
that they've contributed
to the collective poem.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:16.592
So they keep a fragment
of an ever-evolving collective work.

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:21.251
And next year, the collective poem
will take architectural form.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.846
This is the design for the UK Pavilion
at the World Expo 2020.
