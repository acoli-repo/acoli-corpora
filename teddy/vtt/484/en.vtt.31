I once read that a poem learnt by heart

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:33.398
is what you have left,

00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:35.530
what can't be lost,

00:15:35.554 --> 00:15:39.686
even if your house burns down
and you've lost all your possessions.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.554
I want to end with some lines
that I learnt by heart a long time ago.

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:47.099
(Music)

00:15:47.123 --> 00:15:50.004
They're written by the English
novelist E.M. Forster,

00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:54.670
in 1910, just a few years
before Europe, my continent,

00:15:54.694 --> 00:15:56.325
(Music)

00:15:56.349 --> 00:15:58.095
began tearing itself apart.

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:00.017
