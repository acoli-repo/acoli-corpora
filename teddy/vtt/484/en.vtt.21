They're photos of the back of a set,

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:33.670
the part that's not designed
for the audience to see,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.924
however much work it's doing.

00:10:40.185 --> 00:10:42.797
And you know, this is actually the dilemma

00:10:43.962 --> 00:10:46.332
for an artist who is working
as a stage designer,

00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:51.232
because so much of what I make is fake,

00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:52.557
it's an illusion.

00:10:54.073 --> 00:10:58.978
And yet every artist works in pursuit
of communicating something that's true.
