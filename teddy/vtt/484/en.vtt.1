00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.983
The play describes Atlantic crossings,

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:32.860
Alabama cotton fields,

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.034
New York skylines,

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:39.732
and we framed the whole thing
within this single revolving cube,

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.335
a kind of kinetic cinema
through the centuries.

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.318
It's like a musical instrument

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:50.151
played by three performers.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.368
And as they step their way
around and through

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:56.956
the lives of the Lehman brothers,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.465
we, the audience,

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.432
begin to connect
with the simple, human origins
