00:07:57.318 --> 00:08:01.276
the tightrope that they walk
as activists and artists,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.966
a walk through cinema

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.875
that allows the band
to become protagonists

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:07.081
in their own poetry.

00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.455
(Music: U2's "Where the Streets
Have No Name")

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.621
Bono: I wanna run

00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.788
I want to hide

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.677
I wanna tear down the walls

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.732
That hold me inside

00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:29.452
Es Devlin: The end of the show
is like the end of a flight.

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:30.934
It's an arrival.
