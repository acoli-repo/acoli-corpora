00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:01.963
"I saw a TV preacher when I was scared,
at four or five about bad dreams

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:06.456
who promised he'd say a prayer
if I put my hand to the TV.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.654
That's the first time I remember prayer,
an electric current running through me."

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:16.123
And this TV that transmitted prayer
to Beyoncé as a child

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:19.343
became this monolithic revolving sculpture

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.670
that broadcast Beyoncé
to the back of the stadium.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.312
And the stadium is a mass congregation.

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:31.821
It's a temporary population
of a hundred thousand people
