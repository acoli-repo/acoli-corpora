00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:00.423
at one end of the cone,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.743
emerge at the other end of the building,

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:07.066
and find that their word has joined
a collective poem, a collective voice.

00:13:08.796 --> 00:13:15.904

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:25.911
These are simple experiments
in machine learning.

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:32.107
The algorithm that generates
the collective poem is pretty simple.
