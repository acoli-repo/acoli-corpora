00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:01.845
and throwing this deck
of cards in the air

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.616
and leaving them suspended
between sky and sea.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.790
But this transient gesture,
this flick of the wrists

00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:11.576
had to become a structure
that would be strong enough

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.845
to withstand two Austrian winters.

00:10:15.123 --> 00:10:18.074
So there's an awful lot
that you don't see in this photograph

00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:20.075
that's working really hard.

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:24.067
It's a lot of ballast and structure
and support around the back,

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.336
and I'm going to show you the photos
that aren't on my website.

00:10:28.075 --> 00:10:30.181
They're photos of the back of a set,
