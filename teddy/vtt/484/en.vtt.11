00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:32.010
And in the case of the Canadian
artist The Weeknd,

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:34.692
we translated this flight path literally

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:39.086
into an origami paper folding airplane

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.662
that took off over the heads
of the audience,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:44.067
broke apart in mid-flight, complications,

00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:47.669
and then rose out of the ashes restored

00:05:47.693 --> 00:05:49.480
at the end of the show.

00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:51.305
And like any flight,

00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:55.472
the most delicate part
is the liftoff, the beginning,

00:05:55.496 --> 00:05:57.363
because when you design a pop concert,

00:05:57.387 --> 00:06:00.375
the prime material
that you're working with
