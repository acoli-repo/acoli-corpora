It's a temporary population
of a hundred thousand people

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.198
who have all come there to sing along
with every word together,

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:40.845
but they've also come there
each seeking one-to-one intimacy

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.210
with the performer.

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:45.976
And we, as we conceive the show,
we have to provide intimacy

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.838
on a grand scale.

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.607
It usually starts with sketches.

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:55.417
I was drawing
this 60-foot-high, revolving,

00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:58.004
broadcast-quality portrait of the artist,

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:01.435
and then I tore
the piece of paper in half.
