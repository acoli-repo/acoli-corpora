00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:04.331
And now, as I create
large-scale performances,

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.919
I am always working with teams

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:09.739
that are at least the size
of a symphony orchestra.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.244
And whether we are creating

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:16.252
these revolving giant
chess piece time tunnels

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.859
for an opera by Richard Wagner

00:02:18.883 --> 00:02:22.729
or shark tanks and mountains
for Kanye West,

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:28.508
we're always seeking to create
the most articulate sculpture,

00:02:28.532 --> 00:02:32.279
the most poetic instrument
of communication to an audience.
