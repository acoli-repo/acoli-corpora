00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:30.934
It's an arrival.

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.172
It's a transfer from the stage
out to the audience.

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:38.321
For the British band Take That,

00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:42.837
we ended the show by sending
an 80-foot high mechanical human figure

00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.063
out to the center of the crowd.

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:52.087
(Music)

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:56.829
Like many translations
from music to mechanics,

00:08:56.853 --> 00:09:00.133
this one was initially deemed
entirely technically impossible.
