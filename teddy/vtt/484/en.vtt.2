00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.432
begin to connect
with the simple, human origins

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:07.666
at the root of the complex
global financial systems

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.809
that we're all still in thrall to today.

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:15.015
I used to play musical instruments
myself when I was younger.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.348
My favorite was the violin.

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:21.290
It was this intimate transfer of energy.

00:01:22.044 --> 00:01:25.882
You held this organic sculpture
up to your heart,

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.600
and you poured the energy
of your whole body

00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:33.479
into this little piece of wood,
and heard it translated into music.
