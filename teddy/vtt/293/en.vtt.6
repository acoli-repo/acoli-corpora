Think of it as a massive iTunes
for book-type content.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.856
And then take that material
and imagine making it all open,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.936
so that people can modify it,
play with it, improve it.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.216
Imagine making it free,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.479
so that anyone in the world can have
access to all of this knowledge,

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:14.856
and imagine using information technology

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.216
so that you can update this content,
improve it, play with it,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.896
on a timescale that's more
on the order of seconds instead of years.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.776
Instead of editions of a book
coming out every two years,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.736
imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.016
So, imagine we could do that
and imagine we could put people into this.
