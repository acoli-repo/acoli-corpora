00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.616
and I think that it's for our benefit,
really, and for the world's benefit.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.296
OK, so what are the enablers?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.256
What's really making all of this happen?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.896
There's tons of technology,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.776
and the only piece of technology
that I really want to talk about is XML.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.536
How many people know about XML?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.776
Oh, great.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.576
So it's the future of the web, right?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.976
It's semantic representation of content.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.376
And what you can really
think of XML in this case

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.296
is it's the packaging
that we're putting around these pages.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.576
Remember we took the book,
tore the pages out?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.496
Well, what the XML is going to do

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.856
is it's going to turn those pages
into Lego blocks.
