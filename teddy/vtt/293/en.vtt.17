"Burn" is the idea of trying
to create the physical instantiation

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.616
of one of these courses.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.696
And I think a lot of you received --

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.576
I think all of you received one
of these music books in your gift pack.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.056
A little present for you.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.576
Just to tell you quickly about it:
this is an engineering textbook.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.240
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.520
This costs -- anybody guess?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.376
How much would it cost in a bookstore?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.616
(Audience) 65 dollars.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.376
Richard Baraniuk:
OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.
