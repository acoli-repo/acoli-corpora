00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.016
So, imagine we could do that
and imagine we could put people into this.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.416
So that we could truly build
an ecosystem with not just authors,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.016
but all the people
who could be or want to be authors

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.096
in all the different
languages of the world,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.696
and I think if you could do this,
it would be called --

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.296
I'm just going to refer to it
as a knowledge ecosystem.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.416
So, really, this is the dream,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.298
and in a sense what you can think of it

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.465
is we're trying
to enable anyone in the world,

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.016
I mean anyone in the world --

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.256
(Laughter)

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.376
to be their own educational DJ,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.216
creating educational materials,
sharing them with the world,
