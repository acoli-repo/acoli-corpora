Books that might sell
100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.216
There is tremendous
sustaining revenue under this long tail

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.656
to sustain open projects like ours,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.536
but also to sustain this new emergence
of on-demand publishers,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.856
like QOOP, who produced these two books.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.166
And I think one of the things
that you should take away from this talk

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.216
is that there's an impending
cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.896
that's going to be happening
in the publishing industry.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.776
And it's going to reach a crescendo
over the next few years,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.616
and I think that it's for our benefit,
really, and for the world's benefit.
