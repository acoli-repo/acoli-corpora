00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.736
and I talked about how great
the music culture is.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.376
We can share and rip, mix and burn,
but in fact, that's all illegal.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.776
And we would be accused
of [piracy] for doing that,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.136
because this music has been propertized.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.456
It's now owned,
much of it by big industries.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.242
So, really, the key thing here
is we can't let this happen.

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.976
We can't let this
Napster thing happen here.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.953
So, what we have to do
is get it right from the very beginning.

00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:28.376
And what we have to do
is find an intellectual property framework

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.456
that makes sharing safe
and makes it easily understandable.
