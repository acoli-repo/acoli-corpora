00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.176
In particular, textbooks
and the kind of educational materials

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.616
that we use every day in school.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.355
Has anyone here ever been to school?

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:38.776
(Laughter)

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.776
OK, does anybody realize
there's a crisis in our schools,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.576
around the world?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.136
I'm not going to spend
too much time on that,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.496
but what I want to talk about
is some of the disconnects

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.016
that appear when an author
publishes a book.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.898
That in fact, the publishing process --

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:57.113
just because of the fact
that it's complicated,

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.816
it's heavy, books are expensive --

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.136
creates a sort of a wall
between authors of books
