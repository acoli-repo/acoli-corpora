00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.896
and the content.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.736
So, that's sort of
to put it in perspective here.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.336
So, create.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.336
What are some of the people
that are using these kind of tools?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.576
Well, the first thing is,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.456
there's a community
of engineering professors,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.576
from Cambridge to Kyoto,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.536
who are developing engineering content
in electrical engineering

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.536
to develop what you can think of
as a massive, super textbook

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.496
that covers the entire area
of electrical engineering.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.736
And not only that --

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.040
it can be customized for use in each
of their own individual institutions.
