00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.216
creating educational materials,
sharing them with the world,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.976
constantly innovating on them.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.216
So, this is the dream.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.056
In fact, this dream
is actually being realized.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.896
Over the last six-and-a-half years,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.576
we've been working really hard
at Rice University

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.176
on a project called Connexions,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.616
and so what I'd like to do
for the rest of the talk

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.021
is just tell you a little bit

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.096
about what people are doing
with Connexions,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.456
which you can kind of
think of as the counterpoint

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.385
to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.838
where they're working on the hardware
of bringing education to the world.

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:29.336
We're working on the open-source tools

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.896
and the content.
