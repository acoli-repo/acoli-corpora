TWB is currently in Iraq,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.456
training 20,000 teachers
supported by USAID.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.296
And to them, this idea
of being able to remix

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.976
and customize to the local context
is extraordinarily important,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.736
because just providing
free content to people

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.776
has actually been likened
by people in the developing world

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.136
to a kind of cultural imperialism --

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.696
that if you don't empower people

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.096
with the ability
to re-contextualize the material,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.296
translate it into their own language
and take ownership of it,
