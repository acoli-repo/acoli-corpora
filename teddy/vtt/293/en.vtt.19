that are modular, that are customized

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.736
and published on demand
very inexpensively,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.256
either pushed out through Amazon

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.456
or published directly
through an on-demand press, like QOOP.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.896
And I think that this is
an extraordinarily interesting area

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.736
because there is tremendous area
under this long tail in publishing.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.896
We're not talking
about the Harry Potter end,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.136
right at the left side.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.376
We're talking about books

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.016
on hypergeometric
partial differential equations.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.336
Books that might sell
100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.
