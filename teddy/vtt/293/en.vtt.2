and people can burn them or create
final products and continue the circle.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.056
And what that's done
is it's created, like I said,

Today's hit single
is not last year's hit single.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.256
But I'm not here
to talk about music today.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.736
I'm here to talk about books.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.176
In particular, textbooks
and the kind of educational materials
