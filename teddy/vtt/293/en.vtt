I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like
to talk a little bit about today

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:06.936
are some ideas that I think
have just tremendous resonance

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.456
with all the things that have been
talked about the last two days.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.256
So many different points of resonance

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.757
that it's going to be difficult
to bring them all up,

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.096
but I'll try to do my best.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.496
Does anybody remember these?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.296
(Laughter)

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.296
OK, so these are LP records
and they've been replaced, right?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.016
They've been swept away
over the last two decades

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.896
by these types of world-flattening
digitization technologies, right?
