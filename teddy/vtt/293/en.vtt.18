Richard Baraniuk:
OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.736
Why does it cost 22 dollars?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.736
Because it's published on demand

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.296
and it's developed
from this repository of open materials.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.016
If this book were to be published
by a regular publisher,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.216
it would cost at least 122 dollars.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.456
So what we're seeing

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.376
is moving this burning
or publication process

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.896
from the regular,
sort of single-authored book

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.296
towards community-authored materials

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.056
that are modular, that are customized
to each individual class
