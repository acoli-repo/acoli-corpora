00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.896
by these types of world-flattening
digitization technologies, right?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.536
And I think it was best witnessed

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.376
when Thomas was playing the music
as we came in the room today.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.056
What's happened in the music world
is there's a culture,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.856
or an ecosystem that's been created

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.456
that, if you take some words from Apple,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.456
the catchphrase --
that we create, rip, mix and burn.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.656
What I mean by that is that anyone
in the world is free and allowed

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.016
to create new music and musical ideas.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.736
Anyone in the world is allowed
to rip or copy musical ideas,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.496
use them in innovative ways.
