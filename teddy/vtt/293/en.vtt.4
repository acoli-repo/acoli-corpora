00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.136
creates a sort of a wall
between authors of books

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.696
and the ultimate users of books,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.816
be they teachers, students
or just general readers.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.976
And this is even more true
if you happen to speak a language

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.936
other than one of the world's
major languages, and especially English.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.776
I'm going to call these people
below the barrier "shutouts"

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.943
because they're really
shut out of the process

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.495
of being able to share
their knowledge with the world.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.711
And so what I want to talk about today
is trying to take these ideas

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:27.558
that we've seen in the musical culture

00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:29.923
and try to bring these
towards reinventing the way

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:33.776
we think about writing books,
using them and teaching from them.
