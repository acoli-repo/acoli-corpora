00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:33.776
we think about writing books,
using them and teaching from them.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.616
So, that's what I'd like to talk about

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.879
and, really, how we get
from where we are now

00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:39.176
to where we need to go.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.296
The first thing I'd like you to do
is a little thought experiment.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.082
Imagine taking all the world's books.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:47.616
OK, everybody imagine books
and imagine just tearing out the pages.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.736
So, liberating these pages

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.016
and imagine digitizing them
and then storing them

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.936
in a vast, interconnected,
global repository.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.576
Think of it as a massive iTunes
for book-type content.
