00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.656
The same type of mark-up,
like MathML, for chemistry.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.976
Imagine chemistry textbooks

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.216
that actually understand the structure
of how molecules are formed.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.176
Imagine Music XML

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.616
that actually lets you delve
into the semantic structure of music,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.456
play with it, understand it.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.656
It's no wonder that everybody's
getting into it, right?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.936
Even the three wise men.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.136
(Laughter)

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.696
OK, the second big enabler,
and this is where I told a big lie.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.856
The second big enabler
is intellectual property.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.376
Because, in fact, I got up here

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.736
and I talked about how great
the music culture is.
