00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.256
but also governed
by intellectual property.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.696
And the thing that I realized

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.976
is there was no way
that I, as an engineer,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.620
could write this book
that would get all of this across.

00:12:37.644 --> 00:12:39.073
We needed a community to do it

00:12:39.097 --> 00:12:43.136
and we needed new tools
to be able to interconnect these ideas.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.016
And I think that really,
in a sense, what we're trying to do

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.016
is make Minsky's dream come to a reality,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.296
where you can imagine
all the books in a library

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.256
actually starting to talk to each other.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.976
And people who are teachers out here --
whoever taught, you know this --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.496
it's the interconnections between ideas
that teaching is really all about.
