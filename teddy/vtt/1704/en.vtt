00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:02.717
One of the things I want to establish right from the start

00:00:02.717 --> 00:00:05.747
is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.926
I just wanted you to know that.

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:10.335
So I am indeed a neurosurgeon,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.262
and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:15.855
and what I'm going to tell you about today

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.173
is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:20.128
being able to go anywhere in the brain

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:22.547
and turning areas of the brain up or down

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.759
to help our patients.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.709
So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:31.261
It's been around for about 7,000 years.
