Hello, I am Makhtoum Abdalla from Sudan,

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:06.316
born in 2004, in Nyala, South Darfur.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.236
And on the map, the western part of Sudan
is where you find Darfur.

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:14.116
For over a decade,
the state was affected [by] conflict,

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:16.396
which we were still reeling from.

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:19.676
And as a result,
since I was four years old,

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:24.236
my family have lived in a camp
for internally displaced people:

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:28.396
an IDP camp for families
that have been driven from their homes

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:30.556
for one reason or another,
