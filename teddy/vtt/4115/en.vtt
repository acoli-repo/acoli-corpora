In an age of global strife
and climate change,

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:07.106
I'm here to answer
the all important question:

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.201
Why is sex so damn good?

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.178
If you're laughing, you know what I mean.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.040
Now, before we get to that answer,

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.258
let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.949
Chris is a great friend of mine
from my university days,

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:21.813
but secretly, I hate him.

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:24.733
Here's why. Back in university,
we had a quick project

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.715
to design some solar-powered clocks.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.269
Here's my clock.

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:30.746
It uses something called
the dwarf sunflower,
