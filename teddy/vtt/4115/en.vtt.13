of those other senses can
make for a brilliant product.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.337
So what if we started using
the five senses theory

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.572
in all of our designs?

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:41.297
Here's three quick ideas I came up with.

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:43.900
This is an iron, you
know, for your clothes,

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:46.669
to which I added a spraying mechanism,

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.220
so you fill up the vial
with your favorite scent,

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:51.088
and your clothes will smell nicer,

00:06:51.112 --> 00:06:52.684

00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:54.692
the ironing experience more enjoyable.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.864
We could call this "the perfumator."

00:06:57.888 --> 00:06:59.349
All right, next.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.392
So I brush my teeth twice a day,
