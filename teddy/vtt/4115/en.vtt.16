00:07:56.515 --> 00:08:00.408
Now, I realize the five senses
isn't the only thing

00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:02.326
that makes life interesting.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.545
There's also the six emotions

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.109
and that elusive x-factor.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:11.859
Maybe that could be
the topic of my next talk.

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:14.268
Until then, please have fun

00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:16.667
using the five senses in your own lives

00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:18.387
and your own designs.

00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.172
Oh, one last thing before I leave.

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.482
Here's the experience you
all had while listening

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:24.731
to the TED Talks.

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:27.043
However, it would be better
if we could boost up

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:30.707
a couple of the other senses
like smell and taste.
