It uses something called
the dwarf sunflower,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.092
which grows to about 12 inches in height.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.158
Now, as you know, sunflowers

00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:37.394
track the sun
during the course of the day.

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:40.756
So in the morning, you see
which direction the sunflower is facing,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.946
and you mark it on the blank
area in the base.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.897
At noon, you mark the changed
position of the sunflower,

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.269
and in the evening again,
and that's your clock.

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.855
Now, I know my clock doesn't
tell you the exact time,

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.583
but it does give you a general
idea using a flower.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:58.699
So, in my completely unbiased,
subjective opinion,

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:00.418
it's brilliant.
