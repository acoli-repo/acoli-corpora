00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.390
Respondents said that great sex

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:34.245
hits all of the five senses
at an extreme level.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.365
Here I'll quote
one of my students who said,

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.602
"Sex is so good, it's good
even when it's bad."

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:43.915
So the five senses
theory does help explain

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.032
why sex is so good.

00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:48.881
Now in the middle of all this
five senses work,

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:51.690
I suddenly remembered
the solar-powered clocks project

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:52.767
from my youth.

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.759
And I realized this theory
also explains why Chris's clock

00:05:55.783 --> 00:05:57.640
is so much better than mine.

00:05:57.664 --> 00:06:00.769
You see, my clock only focuses on sight,
