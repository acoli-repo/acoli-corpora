00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:00.418
it's brilliant.

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.244
However, here's Chris's clock.

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:07.295
It's five magnifying glasses
with a shot glass under each one.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.216
In each shot glass
is a different scented oil.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.735
In the morning, the sunlight
will shine down

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.394
on the first magnifying glass,

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:16.424
focusing a beam of light
on the shot glass underneath.

00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:18.623
This will warm up the scented oil inside,

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:21.207
and a particular smell will be emitted.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.279
A couple of hours later,
the sun will shine

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:26.576
on the next magnifying glass,
and a different smell will be emitted.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.257
So during the course of the day,
five different smells

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:31.292
are dispersed throughout that environment.
