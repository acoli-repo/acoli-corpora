Many years after the solar
powered clocks project,

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:05.652
a young lady I knew suggested
maybe sex is so good

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:07.592
because of the five senses.

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:10.401
And when she said this, I had an epiphany.

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:14.132
So I decided to evaluate different
experiences I had in my life

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.620
from the point of view of the five senses.

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:20.330
To do this, I devised something
called the five senses graph.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:23.415
Along the y-axis, you have
a scale from zero to 10,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.762
and along the x-axis, you have,
of course, the five senses.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:29.346
Anytime I had a memorable
experience in my life,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.341
I would record it on this graph
like a five senses diary.
