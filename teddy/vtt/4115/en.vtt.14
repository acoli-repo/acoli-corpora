00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.392
So I brush my teeth twice a day,

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:03.798
and what if we had a toothbrush

00:07:03.822 --> 00:07:05.494
that tastes like candy,

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:07.969
and when the taste of candy ran out,

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:10.929
you'd know it's time
to change your toothbrush?

00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:15.508
Finally, I have a thing for the keys
on a flute or a clarinet.

00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:18.934
It's not just the way they look,
but I love the way they feel

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.164
when you press down on them.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:23.304
Now, I don't play the flute
or the clarinet,

00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:27.440
so I decided to combine these keys
with an instrument I do play:

00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:30.651
the television remote control.
