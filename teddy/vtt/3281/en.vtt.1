"Elitist Financial Overlords,"

00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:33.925
"Ruthless Cosmopolitan Rats."

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.015
(Laughter)

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.912
Even by social media standards,
the words are cruel and disgusting.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.101
But they reflect the intensity
of one of the most fundamental questions

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.324
of our times:

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:49.024
Nationalism or globalism --
what is the best path forward?

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:51.925
This question impacts
everything we care about:

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.790
our cultural identity,

00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:55.629
our prosperity,

00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:57.784
our political systems --

00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:00.927
everything -- the health
of our planet -- everything.
