I mean, these political movements
have built their success with ideas

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:03.532
that could mean, down the road,
losing my French citizenship

00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:05.246
because I'm North African

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.822
or not being able to come
back home to the US

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.155
because I come from
a Muslim-majority country.

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:13.016
You know, when you live in a democracy,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.949
you live with this idea that
your government will always protect you,

00:03:16.973 --> 00:03:18.994
as long as you abide by the laws.

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.293
With the rise of national populism,

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:24.749
despite being the best citizen I can,

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:28.351
I now have to live with the idea
that my government can hurt me

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.126
for reasons I cannot control.
