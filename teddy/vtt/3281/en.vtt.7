00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.126
for reasons I cannot control.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.498
It's very unsettling.

00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:33.982
But it forced me to rethink

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.394
and rethink this question
and try to think deeper.

00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:39.096
And the more I thought about it,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.560
the more I started
questioning the question.

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.581
Why would we have to choose
between nationalism and globalism,

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.820
between loving our country
and caring for the world?

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:51.448
There's no reason for that.

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:53.842
We don't have to choose
between family and country

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.915
or region or religion and country.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.428
We already have multiple identities,
and we live with them very well.
