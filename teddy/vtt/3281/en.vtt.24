00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:03.361
to attract new converts
to stay vibrant and relevant over time.

00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:05.134
So just remember this:

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.178
most of us nationalists
in the world are globalists,

00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:11.022
and most of us globalists
in the world are nationalists.

00:12:11.046 --> 00:12:14.111
A lot of what we like
in our national traditions

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:16.451
come from outside our national borders.

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:19.197
And the reason we venture
outside our national borders

00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:21.917
is to discover these other
national traditions.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.660
So the real question should not be

00:12:23.684 --> 00:12:26.370
to choose between
nationalism and globalism.

00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:29.908
The real questions is:
How can we do both better?

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:32.783
It's a complex question
for a complex world
