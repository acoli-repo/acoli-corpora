everything -- the health
of our planet -- everything.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.203
So on the one hand, we have nationalism.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.932
Collins defines it as
a "devotion to one's nation,"

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.720
but also, a "doctrine that puts
national interests

00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:12.891
above international considerations."

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:18.384
For nationalists, our modern societies
are built on national grounds:

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:23.264
we share a land, a history, a culture,
and we defend each other.

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:25.643
In a big and chaotic world,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.422
they see nationalism as the only
sensible way to maintain social stability.
