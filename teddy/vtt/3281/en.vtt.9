00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:31.818
Or maybe like that.

00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.342
You know, it's that thing inside you

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:39.051
when you accidentally watch
an obscure Olympic sport on TV --

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:41.307
(Laughter)

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:42.392
wait --

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:46.323
and the mere sight of an unknown athlete
wearing your national colors

00:04:46.347 --> 00:04:48.080
gets you all excited.

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:49.818
Your heartbeat goes up,

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:51.673
your stress level goes up,

00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:53.520
and you're standing in front of the TV

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:56.175
and screaming with passion
for that athlete to win.

00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:57.788
That's nationalism.

00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:59.546
It's people happy to be together,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.384
happy to belong to a large
national community.
