00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:32.933
but the Latin script, the Latin
alphabet that we use

00:08:32.957 --> 00:08:35.316
has its origins thousands of years ago,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.635
near the Nile River.

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:40.412
It all started with a cow just like this,

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:44.685
that was captured by a scribe
into an elegant hieroglyph.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.796
That hieroglyph was transcribed
by a Semite in the Sinai

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.268
into the letter aleph.

00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:56.012
Aleph traveled with Phoenicians
and reached the European shores in Greece,

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.474
where it became alpha,

00:08:57.498 --> 00:08:59.048
the mother of our letter A.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:02.890
So that's how an Egyptian cow
became our letter A.
