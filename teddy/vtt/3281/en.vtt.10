00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.384
happy to belong to a large
national community.

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.286
Why would it be wrong?

00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:07.770
You know, globalists,
you may think of nationalism

00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:11.596
as an old, 19th-century idea
that is destined to fade.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.356
But I'm sorry to tell you
that the facts are not on your side.

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:19.804
When the World Values Survey
asked more than 89,000 people

00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:21.306
across 60 countries

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.982
how proud they felt about their country,

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:27.929
88.5 percent said "very proud"
or "quite proud" --

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.660
88.5 percent.

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.846
Nationalism is not
going away anytime soon.
