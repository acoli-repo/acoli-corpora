Now, I know that when I dig
into my own nationalist feelings,

00:08:02.756 --> 00:08:05.794
one of my anxieties versus
the globalized world

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.729
is national identity:

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.948
How are we going to preserve
what makes us special,

00:08:10.972 --> 00:08:12.258
what makes us different,

00:08:12.282 --> 00:08:13.916
what brings us together?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.922
And as I started thinking about it,
I realized something really strange,

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:21.856
which is that a lot of the key ingredients
of our national identities

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.585
actually come from outside
our national borders.

00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:27.345
Like, think of the letters
that we use every day.

00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:29.097
I don't know if you realize,

00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:32.933
but the Latin script, the Latin
alphabet that we use
