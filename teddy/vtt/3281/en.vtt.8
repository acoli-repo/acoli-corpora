We already have multiple identities,
and we live with them very well.

00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.893
Why would we have to choose
between country and world?

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:07.704
What if, instead of accepting
this absurd choice,

00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:11.899
we took it on ourselves to fight
this dangerous, binary thinking?

00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:15.105
So for all the globalists in the audience,

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.446
I want to ask:

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.313
When I say the word "nationalist,"
what image comes to your mind?

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.496
Something like this?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.496
Believe me, I think of that, too.

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:27.820
But I'd like you to remember
that for most people,

00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.859
nationalism feels more like this.
