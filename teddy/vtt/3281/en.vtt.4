00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.638
what our ancestors took decades to build.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:04.048
It's like spitting on our soldiers' tombs;

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:07.072
it's eroding our national solidarities

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.211
and opening the doors
to foreign invasions.

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:15.465
But globalists make the case
that reinforcing our global governance

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.216
is the only way to tackle
big supernational problems,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.011
like nuclear proliferation,

00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:24.201
the global refugee crisis,

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:26.941
climate change or terrorism

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:30.145
or even the consequences of superhuman AI.
