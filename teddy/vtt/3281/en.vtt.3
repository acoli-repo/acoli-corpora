00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.422
they see nationalism as the only
sensible way to maintain social stability.

00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:34.032
But alarmed globalists warn us:

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:37.329
self-centered nationalism
can easily turn ugly.

00:01:37.803 --> 00:01:40.511
We've seen it with 20th-century fascisms:

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:45.020
bloody wars, millions of deaths,
immeasurable destruction.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.331
On the other hand, we have globalism.

00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:50.008
The Oxford Living Dictionary
defines it as:

00:01:50.032 --> 00:01:53.383
"the operation or planning
of economic and foreign policy

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:54.829
on a global basis."

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:58.986
For nationalists, globalism
is rapidly deconstructing

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.638
what our ancestors took decades to build.
