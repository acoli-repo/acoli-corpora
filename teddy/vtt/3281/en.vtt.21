So these are good reminders that a lot
of what we love in our national traditions

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:34.382
actually come from previous
waves of globalization.

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:38.539
And beyond individual symbols,
there are whole national traditions

00:10:38.563 --> 00:10:41.621
that could not have existed
without globalization.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.375
And the example that comes to my mind
is a world-beloved national tradition:

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.685
Italian cuisine.

00:10:48.056 --> 00:10:49.860
My friends, if you ever have a chance

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.448
to go to a superauthentic
Italian restaurant

00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:55.117
that only serves ancient Roman recipes,

00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:57.627
my advice for you is: don't go.

00:10:57.651 --> 00:10:59.078
(Laughter)

00:10:59.102 --> 00:11:00.925
You'd get very, very disappointed.
