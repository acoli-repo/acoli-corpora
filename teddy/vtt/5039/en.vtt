One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace

00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:13.968
has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:18.128
hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe.

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:20.435
Little do they know that a third party—

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:21.795
Sausage Saloon—

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.055
has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation.

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:29.775
As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge,

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:33.945
to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception.
