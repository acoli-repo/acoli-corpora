My passions

00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:05.171
are music, technology and making things.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.354
And it's the combination of these things

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:11.050
that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.128
and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.505
This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:19.251
and I have one here tonight.

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.776
It's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.111
it's got a hundred or so holes on top,

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.864
on that side is the speaker, and here

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.040
is some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.641
of propane.

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:32.456
So, let's fire it up and see what it does.
