And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
maybe your personality and your intellect --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
maybe they're also encoded

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in the connections between your neurons.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I am my connectome.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I just want you to remember it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because we have never had technologies

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
powerful enough to test it.
