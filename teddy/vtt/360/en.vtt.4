00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a team of scientists

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
mapped all 7,000 connections

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
between the neurons.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In this diagram, every node is a neuron,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and every line is a connection.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is the connectome

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of the worm C. elegans.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Your connectome is far more complex than this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because your brain

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
contains 100 billion neurons

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and 10,000 times as many connections.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There's a diagram like this for your brain,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but there's no way it would fit on this slide.
