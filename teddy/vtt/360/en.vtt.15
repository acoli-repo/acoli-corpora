00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
at these points of contact.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
By now, you might have sort of lost perspective

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
are contained inside this cube.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
