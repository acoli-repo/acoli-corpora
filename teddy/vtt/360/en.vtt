00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We live in in a remarkable time,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the age of genomics.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Your sequence and mine are slightly different.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's why we look different.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've got brown eyes;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you might have blue or gray.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But it's not just skin-deep.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The headlines tell us

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that genes can give us scary diseases,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
maybe even shape our personality,
