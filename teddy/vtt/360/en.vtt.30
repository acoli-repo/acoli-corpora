00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And if that were successful,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
(Laughter)

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
What a mess --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
have you ever tried to wire up a system

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
as complex as this?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I hope not.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.
