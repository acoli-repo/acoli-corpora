00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and age during adulthood,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
your personal identity changes slowly.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Likewise, every connectome

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
changes over time.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
What kinds of changes happen?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Well, neurons, like trees,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
can grow new branches,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and they can lose old ones.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Synapses can be created,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and they can be eliminated.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And synapses can grow larger,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and they can grow smaller.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Second question:
