00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and they can grow smaller.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Second question:

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
what causes these changes?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Well, it's true.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But that's not the whole story,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because there are signals, electrical signals,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that travel along the branches of neurons

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and chemical signals

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that jump across from branch to branch.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
These signals are called neural activity.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And there's a lot of evidence

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that neural activity

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,
