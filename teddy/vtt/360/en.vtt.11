00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
it wants to send a message to the red neuron,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
it spits out neurotransmitter.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
At the synapse, the two neurons

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
are said to be connected

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
like two friends talking on the telephone.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So you see how to find a synapse.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
How can we find an entire connectome?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We color every neuron in, in a different color,
