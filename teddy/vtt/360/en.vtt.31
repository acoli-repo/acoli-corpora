The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
(Laughter)

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I estimate, millions of miles,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
all packed in your skull.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And if you appreciate that number,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
you can easily see

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
"Anorexic brains are wired differently,"
