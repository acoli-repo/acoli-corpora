00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
by their fantastic shapes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
They extend long and delicate branches,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and in short, they look like trees.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But this is just a single neuron.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In order to find connectomes,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
we have to see all the neurons at the same time.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
at Harvard University.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of a mouse brain.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to obtain the resolution,
