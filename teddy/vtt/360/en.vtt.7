Finding that worm connectome

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
took over a dozen years of tedious labor.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
which are currently under development

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You can recognize them instantly

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
by their fantastic shapes.
