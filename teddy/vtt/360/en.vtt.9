00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to obtain the resolution,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Except, you still may not really recognize them,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If we take many images of many slices of the brain

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and stack them up,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
we get a three-dimensional image.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And still, you may not see the branches.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So we start at the top,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and we do that for the next slice

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and for the next slice.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And we keep on doing that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
slice after slice.
