It will take the work of generations to succeed.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
At the present time, my collaborators and I,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
what we're aiming for is much more modest --

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
just to find partial connectomes

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that I am my connectome.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that it's actually worth taking seriously.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
As you grow during childhood

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and age during adulthood,
