00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
like a chain of falling dominoes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And this sequence of neural activation

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
is hypothesized to be the neural basis

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
of those sequence of movements.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So one way of trying to test the theory

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
is to look for such chains

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
inside connectomes.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They're going to be scrambled up.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we'll have to use our computers

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to try to unscramble the chain.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And if we can do that,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity
