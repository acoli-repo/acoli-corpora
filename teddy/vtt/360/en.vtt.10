00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And we keep on doing that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
slice after slice.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
If we continue through the entire stack,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And we can do that for another neuron in green.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
at two locations,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and these are what are called synapses.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Let's zoom in on one synapse,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You should see small circles --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
these are called vesicles.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
