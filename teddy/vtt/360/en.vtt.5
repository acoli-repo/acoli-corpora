but there's no way it would fit on this slide.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Your connectome contains one million times more connections

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
than your genome has letters.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That's a lot of information.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
What's in that information?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We don't know for sure, but there are theories.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that maybe your memories --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the information that makes you, you --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
maybe your memories are stored

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in the connections between your brain's neurons.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity --
