00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And that's just a mouse brain --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
it's a lot smaller than a human brain.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So when show my friends this,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
sometimes they've told me,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
"You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Neuroscience is hopeless."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you don't really see how complex it is,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but when you use a microscope,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
finally the hidden complexity is revealed.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
In the 17th century,
