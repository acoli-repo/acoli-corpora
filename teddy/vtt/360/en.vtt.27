00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And so we might even speak of

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the stream of consciousness.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Neural activity is its water,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and the connectome is its bed.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So let's return from the heights of metaphor

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and return to science.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
actually work.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
How will we go about testing the hypothesis

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
"I am my connectome?"

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Well, I propose a direct test.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Let us attempt

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to read out memories from connectomes.
