00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but the metaphor is richer than that,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
because it's true that the stream bed

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
guides the flow of the water,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
but over long timescales,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And as I told you just now,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
neural activity can change the connectome.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And if you'll allow me to ascend

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to metaphorical heights,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I will remind you that neural activity

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
