00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And with the stream,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I would like to propose a metaphor

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
for the relationship between neural activity

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and connectivity.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Neural activity is constantly changing.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The connections

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of the brain's neural network

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
determines the pathways

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
along which neural activity flows.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And so the connectome is like bed of the stream;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but the metaphor is richer than that,
