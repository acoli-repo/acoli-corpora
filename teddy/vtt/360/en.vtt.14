It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
everyone's brains are like spaghetti.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Just as one strand of spaghetti

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
contacts many other strands on your plate,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
one neuron touches many other neurons

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
through their entangled branches.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because there can be synapses

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
at these points of contact.
