00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Let us attempt

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to read out memories from connectomes.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Consider the memory

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
of long temporal sequences of movements,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
such memories are stored

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Because, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and so on down the line,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
like a chain of falling dominoes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And this sequence of neural activation
