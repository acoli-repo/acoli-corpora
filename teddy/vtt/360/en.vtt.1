Our genes seem to have

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
awesome power over our destinies.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And yet, I would like to think

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that I am more than my genes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What do you guys think?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Are you more than your genes?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I think some people agree with me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I think we should make a statement.
