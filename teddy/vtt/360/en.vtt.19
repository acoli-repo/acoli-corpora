00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Someday,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a fleet of microscopes will capture

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
every neuron and every synapse

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
in a vast database of images.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
will analyze the images without human assistance

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to summarize them in a connectome.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because finding an entire human connectome

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It will take the work of generations to succeed.
