If you were buying a car in 1899,

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.829
you would’ve had three major
options to choose from.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.246
You could buy a steam-powered car.

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:20.038
Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, 
these could drive as far as you wanted—

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:24.121
provided you also wanted to lug
around extra water to refuel

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.621
and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes
for your engine to heat up.

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.663
Alternatively, you could buy
a car powered by gasoline.
