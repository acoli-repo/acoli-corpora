00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.515
and four times he pulled back in fear.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.593
Humble Nanahuatl stepped forward.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:37.104
The other gods painted him chalky 
white and glued feathers to him.

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:40.281
Without hesitation, he threw himself 
into the flames.

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:43.190
A fire-blackened eagle 
swooped over the fire,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.253
grabbed Nanahuatl and carried 
him into the sky.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:49.042
There, Lord and Lady Sustenance 
bathed him,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:53.012
sat him on a feathered throne, and 
wrapped a red band around his head.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.567
Inspired by Nanahuatl,

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:59.602
Tecciztecatl threw himself into what 
was left of the fire: cooled ashes.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:05.402
A jaguar jumped over the fire pit, but 
couldn’t carry Tecciztecatl into the sky.
