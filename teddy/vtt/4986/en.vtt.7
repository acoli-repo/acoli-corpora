00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:34.060
One by one, Lord Death stabbed them 
in the heart with an obsidian knife,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.998
offering their bodies to 
their new Lord Sun.

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.049
As the last god made the sacrifice,

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.948
Lord Quetzalcoatl blew the embers 
of the great fire back to life,

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:45.688
and the sun began to move 
through the sky at last,

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:48.232
ushering in the fifth age.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:52.242
Thanks to a pimply weakling whose 
fortitude inspired all the other gods,

00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:54.465
the sun moves along its daily path,

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.675
the rabbit-faced moon 
following in its wake.
