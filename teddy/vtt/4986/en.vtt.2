First, the chosen ones had to complete a 
four-day fasting and bloodletting ritual.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.946
Nanahuatl had nothing but cactus thorns 
with which to bleed himself,

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:09.363
and fir branches to paint 
with his red offering,

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:11.483
but he resolved to try his best.

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:14.871
Meanwhile, Tecciztecatl flaunted 
his riches,

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:20.063
using magnificent jade spines and branches
adorned with iridescent quetzal feathers

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.028
for his own blood offering.

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.314
When four days had passed, 
the fire was roaring high.

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:28.954
Four times proud Tecciztecatl 
approached the flames,

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.515
and four times he pulled back in fear.
