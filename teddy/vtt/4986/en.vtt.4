00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:05.402
A jaguar jumped over the fire pit, but 
couldn’t carry Tecciztecatl into the sky.

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:10.026
When Tecciztecatl reached the horizon, a 
band of goddesses dressed him in rags.

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.721
Still, he shined just as brightly 
as Nanahuatl.

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:17.293
But since he had shown far less bravery 
and much more pride,

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:20.816
one of the gods picked up a rabbit 
and tossed it in his face,

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.674
dimming his light.

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.564
But the fifth world still wasn’t 
truly established.

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:28.805
Nanahuatl, Lord Sun,
shined for four days straight

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.387
without moving through the sky like 
all the previous suns had moved.
