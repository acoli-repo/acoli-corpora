00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.549
To establish the Fifth Sun,

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.142
Lord Quetzalcoatl, 
the “Feathered Serpent,”

00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:36.796
had gone to the underworld and 
returned with the bones of earlier people,

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:40.031
nourishing them with his own 
blood to create new life.

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:41.969
But for them to have a world to live in,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.420
another god had to leap into the 
great bonfire and become the fifth sun.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.370
The Lord of Sustenance and the Lord of 
Fire had chosen Nanahuatl for this task,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.205
while the Lord of Rain and 
the Lord of the Four Quarters

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:59.045
had picked their own offering:
the proud, rich Tecciztecatl.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:03.305
First, the chosen ones had to complete a 
four-day fasting and bloodletting ritual.
