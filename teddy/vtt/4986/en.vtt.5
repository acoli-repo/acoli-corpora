00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.387
without moving through the sky like 
all the previous suns had moved.

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:36.286
Back in their home, Teotihuacan, 
the gods began to worry.

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:39.791
They sent Obsidian Hawk up 
to ask what was wrong.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:44.313
Nanahuatl replied that just as he had 
sacrificed himself to become Lord Sun,

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:47.366
he now needed the nourishing 
blood of the other gods

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.615
in order to move through the sky.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:55.277
Enraged at this suggestion, Lord Dawn 
stepped up and shot an arrow at Lord Sun.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.581
Lord Sun shot back,

00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.700
and his quetzal-feathered arrows 
struck Lord Dawn in the face,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.493
turning him to frost.
