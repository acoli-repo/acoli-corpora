00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A play about early 20th century plowing technology

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and cavalry charges

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
at the National Theatre in London.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So we began with a test.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and our next-door neighbor Katherine,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
riding on a ladder.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
AK: And once we put Katherine

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
through that particular brand of hell,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
