Adrian thought

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and make it breathe like that --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But we realized

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that, if that were to be happening,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So he made a channel in here,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the chest moves up and down in that channel.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
but it feels like breath.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it's very, very simple

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because all that happens

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.
