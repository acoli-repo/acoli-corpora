00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
AK: Other emotional stuff.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
If I were to touch the horse here

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
on his skin,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and get the skin to quiver.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You'll notice, of course,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that the puppet is made out of cane lines.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that somehow moves in space.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But of course, it was the cane is light,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the cane is flexible, the cane is durable
