WEBVTT

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
is three guys

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
while they're onstage

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
because they're mic'd.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
the whinnying and the nickering and everything --

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that starts usually with one performer,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
carries on with a second person

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and ends with a third.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
