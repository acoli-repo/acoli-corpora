00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
after the model was approved,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the prototype took a bit longer

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
than we anticipated.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And we had a crate built for it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It had to be shipped to London.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
BJ: So we got a camera,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and we posed the puppet

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
in various galloping stances.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And we sent it off

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to the National Theatre,
