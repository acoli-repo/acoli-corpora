The hyena is the ancestor of the horse

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
because it was part of a production

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
called "Faustus in Africa,"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a Handspring Production from 1995,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This production was directed

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
by South African artist and theater director,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
William Kentridge.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So it needed a very articulate front paw.
