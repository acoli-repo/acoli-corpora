00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we call this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
a piece of emotional engineering

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that uses up-to-the-minute

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
17th century technology --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Laughter)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to turn nouns

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
into verbs.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
AK: Well actually I prefer to say

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
constructed out of wood and cloth

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
with movement built into it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to persuade you to believe that it has life.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
BJ: Okay so.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
AK: It has ears that move passively
