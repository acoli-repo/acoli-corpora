00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for this art form.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to form a puppet company.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And 20 years later, miraculously,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we collaborated with a company from Mali,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.

BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but it's ultimately the same structure.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's got two people inside it on stilts,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which give them the height,
