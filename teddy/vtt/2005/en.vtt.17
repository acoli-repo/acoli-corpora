00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But because they have to be light and flexible,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and each one of them is different,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So here are some half-finished horses

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
ready to be worked in London.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And now we would like to introduce you

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to Joey.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Joey boy, you there?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Joey.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Applause)
