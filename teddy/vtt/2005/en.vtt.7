00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in 1971,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I hated puppets.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I really thought they were so beneath me.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And, in fact, it took about 10 years

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to discover

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to learn a renewed, or a new, respect

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for this art form.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine
