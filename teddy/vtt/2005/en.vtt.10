"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
called 'War Horse'?"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The horse is sold to the First World War,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and he joins up to find his horse.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"Do you think you could make us a horse

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AK: It had to have a rider,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it had to participate in cavalry charges.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(Laughter)
