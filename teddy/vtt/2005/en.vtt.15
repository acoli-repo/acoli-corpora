This is in the National Theatre studio,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the place where they cook new ideas.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It had by no means got the green light yet.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
invented a beautiful sequence

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
where the baby horse,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
grew up into the big horse.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And so the show was given the green light.
