But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
BJ: One of them is breath,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it kind of breathes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
AK: Haa haa haaa.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
BJ: Breath is really important for us.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's the kind of original movement

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AK: Oops.
