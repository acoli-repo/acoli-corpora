00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Meet Tony. He's my student.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
He's about my age,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When Tony was 16 years old,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one day, one moment,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"It was mom's gun.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I say, 'Let's do this.'"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,
