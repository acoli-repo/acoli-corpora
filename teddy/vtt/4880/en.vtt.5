00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.065
If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:33.881
between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone.

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:37.764
That error is so common,
we even have a name for it:

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:39.890
affirming the consequent,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.676
or the fallacy of the converse.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.606
This fallacy wrongly assumes

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.632
that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result,

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.159
it must also be sufficient for it.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.911
For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.893
for being a habitable planet.

00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:59.850
But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition –

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.231
planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability.
