00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:31.149
It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.529
to see what’s on the other side of each.

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.400
But in fact, only two of them matter.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.318
Let’s look at the protocol again.

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:42.602
All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.626
It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes,

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.632
so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven.

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.089
What about the box with a red top?

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:54.457
Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even?

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.548
As it turns out, we don’t.

00:01:56.548 --> 00:02:00.413
The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number,
