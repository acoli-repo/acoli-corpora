00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.594
The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.897
when you receive an urgent message.

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:36.480
One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.699
but they lost track of which one.

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.913
All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:45.186
Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four,

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:46.619
and one with a seven.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.496
The other two are facing up:

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:49.865
one with a black top,

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.196
another with a red one.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:54.764
You know that any violation 
of the protocol

00:00:54.764 --> 00:01:00.596
will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger.
