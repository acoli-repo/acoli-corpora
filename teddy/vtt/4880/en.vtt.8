00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:02.394
they’re not the only ones who do so.

00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:05.777
In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary,

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:08.004
and when they’re abstracted that way,

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.463
the logical connections 
become harder to see.

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:14.946
In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:17.583
to enable the resistance 
to fight another day.

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:20.200
And you did it by thinking 
outside the box –

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.849
both sides of it.
