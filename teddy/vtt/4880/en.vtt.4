00:01:56.548 --> 00:02:00.413
The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number,

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:02.805
then it should have a red top.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:07.930
It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.650
or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.254
The requirement 
only goes in one direction.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:17.871
So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.569
We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.120
to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.065
If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match
