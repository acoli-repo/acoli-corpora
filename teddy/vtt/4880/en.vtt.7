00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:30.298
Well, it’s easy –

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:33.781
make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant,

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.054
and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat.

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:39.146
The onions can go to either place,

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:43.204
and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product.

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:45.417
Why does this scenario seem easier?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.626
Formally, it’s the same problem –

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.277
two possible conditions
for the top of the box,

00:03:50.277 --> 00:03:51.882
and two for the bottom.

00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:55.652
But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs,

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.844
and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables,

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:02.394
they’re not the only ones who do so.
