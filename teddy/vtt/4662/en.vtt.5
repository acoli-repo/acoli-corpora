00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.707
like mosquito A or mosquito B?

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:31.882
HS: Yeah.

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:33.659
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.755
And again, she is much lower
than the male.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.476
GG: Yeah, she sounds different.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.150
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:44.676
Yeah, she's spot-on 400.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.834
HS: She really is.
GG: That's really bizarre.

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:50.597
HS: The females are at a much
lower pitch. They were around 400 hertz.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.914
HS: And all of the females
were around that, too.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:54.747
They were much larger than the males,

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.218
so they didn't have to flap their wings
as fast to stay in free flight.

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.235
GG: So they have larger wings,
so they're flapping slower.
