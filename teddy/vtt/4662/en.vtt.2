First, we anesthetize them
in a fridge or a bed of ice.

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:04.575
And then I transfer them
to this petri dish of ice,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.505
just to get them even more anesthetized.

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:10.053
Next, I take an insect pin,

00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:14.554
and what I do is put a tiny little dab
of superglue on this pin.

00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:18.318
I want to make sure that I get it
on his thorax above his wings

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:21.795
so that when he is suspended,
his wings are still free to move.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:22.978
So here's one down.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.527
It's really hard to catch
male mosquitoes in the wild

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.804
because females are the only mosquitoes
that are attracted to humans.

00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:31.424
They feed on human blood.
