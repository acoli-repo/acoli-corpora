00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.116
HS: They're communicating
to let each other know

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.298
that they've basically
found a potential mate.

00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:03.472
GG: So in other words,

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:06.492
the female tends to choose
a male that best sings her duet.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:08.659
And studies have found
that if she's pregnant,

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:09.915
she doesn't even bother.

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.344
So if we can understand
the mosquito mating behavior,

00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:17.445
we may be able to disrupt it in the wild
and prevent diseases like malaria.

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:21.349
But for now, the next time
you hear a mosquito buzzing,

00:04:21.373 --> 00:04:24.644
just pause and remember she may be in love

00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:26.222
and she may be singing her song,

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:28.178
looking for her perfect match.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.203
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.377
