Greg Gage: We've all heard
the annoying sound of a mosquito,

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:07.740
and we will stop at nothing
to make it go away.

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:09.669
While this sound may be maddening to us,

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:11.612
perhaps it's music to a mosquito's ears.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:15.870
The mosquito's nervous system has almost
as many sensory auditory cells as we do.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.910
But why would they have
so many in such a small body,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.481
and why would they need to be
so sensitive to sounds?

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:22.698
The answer is love.

As humans, we do a lot
to attract each other.
