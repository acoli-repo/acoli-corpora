00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:31.424
They feed on human blood.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:36.769
And now, we can try to get
some recordings from them.

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.090
So this is the stand
that I use to hold them.

00:01:39.114 --> 00:01:41.269
I like to place it
right over the microphone

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:44.084
so that I can get a recording
of the buzzing that you hear.

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:47.109
That sound is generated
by how fast they're beating their wings.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.371
This is a male.

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:52.071
The males have very bushy antennae,
and they look kind of feathery.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.611
And they are also much smaller.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.899
GG: So he's flying at around 600 hertz.

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:00.400
Can we try a female mosquito?
