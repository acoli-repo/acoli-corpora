00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:32.803
GG: OK, pause.

00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:35.120
The males and females are singing a duet,

00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:38.574
meaning that they adjust their wings
to be able to produce a common tone.

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:41.272
You have the male singing up here at G,

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:44.149
and you have the female
singing down here at D,

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:45.461
and when they get together,

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:48.698
you're saying that they change
the frequency of their wings

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:50.185
such that they come together?

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.648
HS: Yeah, exactly.
GG: And they sort of sing a duet.

00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:57.775
(Mosquitoes gradually
adjusting to identical pitch)

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.116
HS: They're communicating
to let each other know
