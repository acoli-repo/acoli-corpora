00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:00.400
Can we try a female mosquito?

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:02.454
HS: Sure, here we go.

00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:08.129
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:09.399
GG: Wow.

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:11.959
HS: This is a much lower
frequency than the male.

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.118
GG: Yeah, it sounds completely different.

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.999
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:18.499
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:20.887
So is it because they're
two different mosquitoes,

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.592
or because they're male and female?

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:24.533
HS: It's because
they're male and female.

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:26.198
GG: Alright, let's verify that.

00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:28.809
Can you bring in another female
and see if she sounds

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.707
like mosquito A or mosquito B?
