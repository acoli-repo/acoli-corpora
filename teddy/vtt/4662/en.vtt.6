00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.235
GG: So they have larger wings,
so they're flapping slower.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.584
And you noticed that all the females
have the same frequency, roughly?

00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:07.021
And the males do, too.
That's kind of interesting.

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:08.565
So that must mean something.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:12.131
Well, let's see what happens when
we put the male and the female together.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:16.152
(Mosquitoes buzzing; pitch varies)

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:18.511
HS: When I put them
into the same hearing range,

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:21.319
I noticed that they were kind of
changing their tones.

00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:23.605
It was kind of more dull, almost.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.206
(Mosquitoes buzzing)

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.969
And when I put it back in my spectrogram
to see their interaction,

00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:31.318
they were meeting at the same tone.
