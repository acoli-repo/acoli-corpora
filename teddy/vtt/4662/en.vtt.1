00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:31.150
Some things are conscious --

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:33.274
we put on makeup
and make sure we smell nice.

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:34.524
And some are unconscious.

00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:38.168
You may unconsciously point your body
or even sit closer to someone you like.

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.579
These are courtship behaviors,
and a lot of animals have them.

00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:43.205
And mosquitoes are no different.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.523
So Haley's been spending her summer
bravely listening to mosquitoes,

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.468
and what she observed may surprise you.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:51.923
So we want to investigate
how the mosquitoes make their song.

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:54.486
So Haley, how do we record
their wing beats?

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.295
Haley Smith: We need to tether them.

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.098
First, we anesthetize them
in a fridge or a bed of ice.
