You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has been around since before the French Revolution.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What's changed

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is we now can look at the evidence,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and see what inequality does.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to take you through that data

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then explain why

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.
