00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
First, soon, and then a lot.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Hell, ponytail alone.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I don't know what else to tell you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I got a pencil you can borrow.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You can put it in your phone."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
She just says, "No thank you."
