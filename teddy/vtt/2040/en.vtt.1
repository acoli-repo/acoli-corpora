00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These are when.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She wears it every day.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not considered vintage --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's because she dances.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or "I heart you!"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"I'm laughing out loud."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"I want to give you a hug."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But he comes up with that, you know.
