00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
At least, that's how it seems.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm a monkey --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
blowing kisses

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
at a butterfly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
First, soon, and then a lot.
