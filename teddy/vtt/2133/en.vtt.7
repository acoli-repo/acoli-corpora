It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm like, can you imagine being the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
T-Mobile PR lady? You know?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
"Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and we're not talking smartphones --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
all your calls are free.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.
