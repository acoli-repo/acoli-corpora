You know, I found that volcano on Google Images,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Anyway, this all started a few years ago,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we've come a long way since that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, it works just like a regular phone.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,
