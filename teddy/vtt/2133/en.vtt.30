your voicemail into text.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And they send it either to your email

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000

And by the way, they don't always get the words right,

Phonetag -- this is the one I use --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Callwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I don't really want people listening in to my calls."

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
The executives at these companies told me,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.
