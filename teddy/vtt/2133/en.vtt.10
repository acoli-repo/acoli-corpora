As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
into the cellular network on a call with my wife --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
look at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
DP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk -- do you mind?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
JP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
DP: What are you guys doing?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Right there!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.
