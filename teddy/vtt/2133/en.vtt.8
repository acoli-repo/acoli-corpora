And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The answer is, "All the time!"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Because they give you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a regular wireless router that works with the phone,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for your house.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Which is really ingenious, because we all know that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Laughter)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.
