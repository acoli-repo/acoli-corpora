00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
What you're going to use is Google Cellular.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's totally free -- there's not even ads.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You send a text message to the word "Google,"

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
which turns out to be 46645.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Leave off the last "e" for savings.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Anyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You hit send, and in five seconds,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
they will send you back the two closest drugstores,
