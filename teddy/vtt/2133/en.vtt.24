I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"Which actors have played James Bond?"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They text me back this: "Sean Connery,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Right! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Just to see how the recognition was.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.
