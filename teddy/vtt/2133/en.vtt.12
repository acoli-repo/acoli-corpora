00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
which would be like 10 minutes --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the call will continue to be free.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Because they don't, they haven't --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
well, no, wait! Not so fast.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It also works the other way.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So if you start a call on your cellular network

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and you come home, you keep being billed.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Which is why most people with this service

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
get into the habit of saying,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now you get it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
right? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.
