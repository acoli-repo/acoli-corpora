Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and any time you were in a wireless hotspot --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
free calls anywhere in the world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
never pay the cellular company a nickel.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It'd be really, really cool -- and yet,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
even though the technology for this has been available

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for five years, incredibly,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the number of standard cell phones

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
offered by US carriers with free VOIP

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is zero!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I can't figure out why!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Laughter)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Actually, I need to update that. There's one now.
