"You may begin speaking at the tone.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
When you have finished recording,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you may hang up." No!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And then it gets worse:

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
when I call to retrieve my messages,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
first of all: "You have 87 messages.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
To listen to your messages ... "

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Why else am I calling?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
(Laughter)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Of course I want to listen to the messages!
