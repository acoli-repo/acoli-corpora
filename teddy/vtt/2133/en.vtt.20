yeah! You're all trying to write this down.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is that it requires you to know how to text --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
send a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I'm going to teach you something even better.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
This is called Google Info.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So lets say I'm in Monterey,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and I want what?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I want to find what? Bagels. OK.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Google: Say the business and the city and state.
