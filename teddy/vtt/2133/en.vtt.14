I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I should know not to do technology demos

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Anyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Excuse me one second.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Hello?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Oh. Where are you calling from?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Oh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!
