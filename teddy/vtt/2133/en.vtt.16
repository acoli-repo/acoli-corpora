00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where they give you a new phone number,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(this is the EG crowd).

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The beauty of that is you never miss a call.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I know a lot of you are like,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But the beauty is it's all going through the internet,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
so you get all of these really cool features --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
like you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And I want these people to hear this greeting,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."
