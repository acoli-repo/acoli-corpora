00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, indeed, I have spent my life

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But when I try and think about what I've learned

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
work, love and play.
