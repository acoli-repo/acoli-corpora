00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.215
So I'm going to talk about trust,

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:04.495
and I'm going to start by reminding you

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.576
of the standard views that people have about trust.

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:10.815
I think these are so commonplace,

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.103
they've become clichÃ©s of our society.

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.129
And I think there are three.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.961
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.869
very widely believed.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.376
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:31.866
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
