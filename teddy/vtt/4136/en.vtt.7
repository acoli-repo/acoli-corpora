00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
enriches meaning.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It activates a different part of the brain.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And then the limbic system

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is activated when we see motion, when we see color,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that we've heard about before.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So the point of this is what?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We make meaning by seeing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
by an act of visual interrogation.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The lessons for us are three-fold.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.
