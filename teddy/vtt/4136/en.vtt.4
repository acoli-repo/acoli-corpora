00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So that's the part of the brain that is activated

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
when you give a word to something.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And what it does is locates the object

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in physical body space.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So if you look around the stage here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The third part that I'd like to talk about

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
is the limbic system.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.
