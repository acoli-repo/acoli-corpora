00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the overwhelming complexity

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and richness that we experience at the conference

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in a project called Big Viz.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that were made by two visual artists.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
David Sibbet from The Grove,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
made 650 sketches that strive to capture

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the essence of each presenter's ideas.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the consensus was: it really worked.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
These sketches brought to life the key ideas,
