00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And it's the part that feels.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and you go, "Oh! I have a strong

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So the combination of these processing centers

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
help us make meaning in very different ways.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Well, again, the schematic view

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
asking a whole bunch of questions
