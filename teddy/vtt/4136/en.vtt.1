00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
These sketches brought to life the key ideas,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the portraits, the magic moments

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we all experienced last year.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What is it about animation,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this is an important question to ask and answer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the better we can communicate,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So this year we're going to visualize how

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the brain visualizes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain
