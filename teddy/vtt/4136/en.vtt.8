First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Secondly make those images interactive

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so that we engage much more fully.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the third is to augment memory

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
by creating a visual persistence.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
These are techniques that can be used to be --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So the low-tech version looks like this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And, by the way, this is the way in which

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
we develop and formulate

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
strategy within Autodesk,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
What we literally do is have the teams
