00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the brain visualizes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
doesn't actually see the world as it is,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but instead, creates a series of mental models

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
through a collection of "Ah-ha moments,"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or moments of discovery, through various processes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
at the primary visual cortex.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
just the simplest of shapes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But it also acts like a kind of relay station
