00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
asking a whole bunch of questions

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to create a unified mental model.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, for example, when you look at this image

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a good graphic invites the eye to dart around,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to selectively create a visual logic.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's the selective logic.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
where we quite literally create an infinite wall.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
