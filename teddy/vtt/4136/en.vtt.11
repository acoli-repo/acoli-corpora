00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that use large-screen displays

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
with intelligent calculation in the background

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to make the invisible visible.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So a team can actually look at

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
all the key components that heat the structure

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and make choices and then see the end result

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that is visualized on this screen.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So making images meaningful has three components.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Secondly, making them interactive.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And then thirdly, making them persistent.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And I believe that these three principles
