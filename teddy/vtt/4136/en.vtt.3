00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But it also acts like a kind of relay station

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that re-radiates and redirects information

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to many other parts of the brain.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We're only going to talk about three of them.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the first one is called the ventral stream.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's on this side of the brain.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's the "what" detector.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So that's the part of the brain that is activated
