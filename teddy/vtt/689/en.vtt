00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:05.792
So I stand before you
as an evolutionary biologist,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.143
a professor of evolutionary biology,

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:13.184
which sounds like a rather fancy title,
if I may say so myself.

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:15.684
And I'm going to talk about two topics

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:17.833
that aren't normally
talked about together,

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:22.101
and that's market economies and fungi.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:26.226
Or is it fun-GUY, or,
as we say in Europe now, fun-GEE?

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.542
There's still no consensus
on how to say this word.
