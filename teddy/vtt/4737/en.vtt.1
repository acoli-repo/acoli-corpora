00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.035
In the 1890s, William James,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.815
the father of American psychology, said,

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.233
"Most of us do not meet
our mental potential."

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.337
James meant this as a challenge,

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.802
not an indictment of scant brain usage.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.711
But the misunderstanding stuck.

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:45.223
Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.553
the purpose of our massive frontal lobes

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:50.139
or broad areas of the parietal lobe.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.057
Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits,

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.020
so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything.

00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:59.442
For decades, these parts
were called silent areas,

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.101
their function elusive.
