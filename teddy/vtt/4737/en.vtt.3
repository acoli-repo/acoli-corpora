00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.808
which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass,

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.446
consumes 20% of daily glucose burned.

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:38.226
In children, that figure is 50%,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.386
and in infants, 60%.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:44.194
This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes,

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.612
which scale in proportion to body size.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.893
Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms,

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:50.616
elephant brains 5 kg,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.726
and whale brains 9 kg,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.643
yet on a per weight basis,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.373
humans pack in more neurons
than any other species.

00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.019
This dense packing
is what makes us so smart.
