than if we ate food stuffs raw

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.013
and so we can sustain brains

00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:36.038
with 86 billion densely packed neurons.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.030
40% more than the ape.

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:39.834
Here's how it works.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.709
Half the calories a brain burns

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.924
go towards simply keeping
the structure intact

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:46.678
by pumping sodium and potassium ions

00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:49.891
across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.178
To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog.

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:54.888
It consumes an astounding

00:02:54.912 --> 00:03:00.357
3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute,
