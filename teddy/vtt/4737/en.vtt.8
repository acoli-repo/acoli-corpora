00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:02.321
The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.372
that the brain can have active at once.

00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:05.986
For maximum efficiency,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.730
between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:13.824
This is the energy limit
we have to live with

00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:15.372
in order to be conscious at all.

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:16.935
The need to conserve resources

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.267
is the reason
most of the brain's operations

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.697
must happen outside of consciousness.

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.169
It's why multitasking is a fool's errand.

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:26.947
We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:28.759
let alone three or five.

00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:30.891
When we try, we do each task less well
