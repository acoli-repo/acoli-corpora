00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:30.891
When we try, we do each task less well

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.219
than if we had given it
our full attention.

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:34.747
The numbers are against us.

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.387
Your brain is already smart and powerful.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.030
So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful.

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:42.230
And so smart

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:44.895
that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan.

00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:47.992
So don't let a fraudulent myth
make you guilty

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.799
about your supposedly lazy brain.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:51.738
Guilt would be a waste of energy.

00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:52.809
After all this,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.281
don't you realize
it's dumb to waste mental energy?

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:58.080
You have billions of
power-hungry neurons to maintain.

00:04:58.104 --> 00:04:59.210
So hop to it!
