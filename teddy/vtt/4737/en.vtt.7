00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:30.405
Here's where energy efficiency comes in.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.871
Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time,

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.788
known as sparse coding,

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.348
uses the least energy,

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:40.642
but carries the most information.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:42.895
Because the small number of signals

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.956
have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.004
A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons

00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:51.330
is its cost.

00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:54.155
Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire,

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:55.575
then they are superfluous

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.810
and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago.

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:02.321
The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells
