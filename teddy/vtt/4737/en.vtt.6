00:02:54.912 --> 00:03:00.357
3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute,

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:02.990
ATP being the coal of the body's furnace.

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:05.930
The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.194
in all 86 billion neurons

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:09.975
means that little energy is left

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.458
to propel signals down axons
and across synapses,

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:16.345
the nerve discharges
that actually get things done.

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.289
Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons

00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:22.153
fired in a given region at any one time,

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:26.120
the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:27.438
would be unsustainable.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:30.405
Here's where energy efficiency comes in.
