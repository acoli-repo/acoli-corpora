00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.101
their function elusive.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.230
We've since learned that they underscore

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:04.944
executive and integrative ability,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.199
without which, we would hardly be human.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:09.239
They are crucial to abstract reasoning,

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:10.784
planning, weighing decisions

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.213
and flexibly adapting to circumstances.

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:17.310
The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:20.564
looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.825
Rodent and canine brains

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.424
consume 5% of total body energy.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:27.261
Monkey brains use 10%.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.096
An adult human brain,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.808
which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass,
