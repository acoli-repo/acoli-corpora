00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.019
This dense packing
is what makes us so smart.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.544
There is a trade-off between body size

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:05.590
and the number of neurons a primate,

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:07.165
including us, can sustain.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.666
A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.751
to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons.

00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:15.993
The invention of cooking,

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:17.494
one and half million years ago,

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:19.319
gave us a huge advantage.

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:22.336
Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.618
outside of the body.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.074
Our guts more easily absorb its energy.

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.153
Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy

00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.979
than if we ate food stuffs raw
