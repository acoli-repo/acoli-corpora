00:06:57.638 --> 00:07:00.607
We use 5,000-plus people,

00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:04.528
a representative sample of Americans
based on the US census.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.444
We've got data now on over 30,000 people,

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.935
and every single year,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.485
I see some of the same patterns.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.288
Every single year when I ask the question,

00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:18.075
over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand --

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.766
not necessarily last year,
but in their lives --

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.063
50 percent have had
a friends with benefits

00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:24.694
during the course of their lives,

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:28.286
and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.746
before marrying.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.972
Americans think that this is reckless.
