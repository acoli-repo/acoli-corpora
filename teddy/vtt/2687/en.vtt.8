We can give you various people --

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.966
all the dating sites can --

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.903
but the only real algorithm
is your own human brain.

00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:08.499
Technology is not going to change that.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:13.685
Technology is also not going to change
who you choose to love.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.405
I study the biology of personality,

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:17.641
and I've come to believe

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.948
that we've evolved four very broad
styles of thinking and behaving,

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.802
linked with the dopamine, serotonin,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.004
testosterone and estrogen systems.

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:30.511
So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science
