00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:31.353
creating a case of "FOMO"

00:14:31.377 --> 00:14:33.019
and then leading us --

00:14:33.043 --> 00:14:36.358
FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
or fear of missing out --

00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:39.340
it's like, "How do I know
I have found 'the one' --

00:14:39.364 --> 00:14:40.536
the right one?"

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.243
So we've created what I call
this thing of "stable ambiguity."

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.305
Stable ambiguity is when
you are too afraid to be alone

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:52.364
but also not really willing
to engage in intimacy-building.

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:57.682
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
the uncertainty of a relationship

00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:00.313
but also the uncertainty of the breakup.
