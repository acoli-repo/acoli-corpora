00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:30.511
So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:33.677
to measure the degree to which
you express the traits --

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.455
the constellation of traits --

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.487
linked with each
of these four brain systems.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:43.697
I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.363
in 40 countries.

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.859
Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire,

00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:53.808
and I've been able to watch
who's naturally drawn to whom.

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:55.973
And as it turns out,

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:58.566
those who were very expressive
of the dopamine system

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.725
tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic --
