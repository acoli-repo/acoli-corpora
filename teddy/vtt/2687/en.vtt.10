tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic --

I would imagine there's an awful lot
of people like that in this room --

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:07.152
they're drawn to people like themselves.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.559

need people like themselves.

of the serotonin system

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.124
tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules,

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:18.026
they respect authority,

they tend to be religious -- religiosity
is in the serotonin system --

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.797
and traditional people
