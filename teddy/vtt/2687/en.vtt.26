00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:01.366
Let's have her join us on the stage.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.541
Esther?

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:05.696
(Applause)

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.495

that resonated with you
through the lens of your own work

00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:19.421
that you'd like to comment on?

00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:23.641
Esther Perel: It's interesting,

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:27.494

is ubiquitous and universal.

00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:29.929
But the way we love --

00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:31.483
the meaning we make out of it --
