00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:30.883
people who had just
fallen happily in love,

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.938
people who had just been rejected in love

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.835
and people who are in love long-term.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.046
And it is possible
to remain "in love" long-term.

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:40.449
And I've long ago maintained

00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:43.498
that we've evolved three distinctly
different brain systems

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.359
for mating and reproduction:

00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:46.535
sex drive,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.495
feelings of intense romantic love

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.265
and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.725
And together, these three brain systems --

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.237
with many other parts of the brain --

00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:02.387
orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives.
