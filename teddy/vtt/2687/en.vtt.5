They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:34.696
and they're not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.267
(Laughter)

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.737
(Applause)

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:43.376
There's no question that technology
is changing the way we court:

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.324
emailing, texting,

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:47.323
emojis to express your emotions,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:48.611
sexting,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.071
"liking" a photograph, selfies ...

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.207
We're seeing new rules
and taboos for how to court.

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.923
But, you know --

00:02:57.947 --> 00:03:01.091
is this actually
dramatically changing love?
