Americans think that this is reckless.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:34.915
I have doubted that for a long time;

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.831
the patterns are too strong.

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.583
There's got to be some
Darwinian explanation --

00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:41.933
Not that many people are crazy.

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:45.845
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.866
It was a very interesting academic article

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.903
in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today

00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:56.341
who are living long-term with somebody,

00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.452
have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce.
