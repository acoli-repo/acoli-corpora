00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.980
I'm not suggesting that we're not --

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.151
that we're necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.923
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.382
I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it,

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.254
and some of the brain circuitry of it.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.221
It's very common around the world,

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.182
but we are built to love.

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:19.032
How is technology changing love?

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.987
I'm going to say almost not at all.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.098
I study the brain.

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:27.852
I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner --

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:30.883
people who had just
fallen happily in love,
