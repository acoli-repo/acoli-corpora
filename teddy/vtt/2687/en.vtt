00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:03.888
I was recently traveling
in the Highlands of New Guinea,

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:06.406
and I was talking with a man
who had three wives.

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:09.994
I asked him, "How many wives
would you like to have?"

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.774
And there was this long pause,

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:12.993
and I thought to myself,

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:14.568

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:16.019
Is he going to say 10?

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:17.885
Is he going to say 25?"

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.071
And he leaned towards me

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.605
and he whispered, "None."

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.809
(Laughter)

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:27.889
Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives:

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.064
polygyny.

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.197
But in the vast majority
of these cultures,
