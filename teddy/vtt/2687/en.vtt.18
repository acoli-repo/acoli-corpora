But the human brain --

00:09:01.177 --> 00:09:03.186

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.024
The human brain always triumphs,

00:09:05.048 --> 00:09:06.943
and indeed, in the United States today,

00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:10.465
86 percent of Americans
will marry by age 49.

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:14.035
And even in cultures around the world
where they're not marrying as often,

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:17.334
they are settling down eventually
with a long-term partner.

00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:19.193
So it began to occur to me:

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:23.784
during this long extension

if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry,

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.452
maybe we're going to see
more happy marriages.

00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:34.713
So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America --
