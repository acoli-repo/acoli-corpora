00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.452
have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce.

00:08:00.476 --> 00:08:02.332
They're terrified of the social,

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.889
legal, emotional,

00:08:03.913 --> 00:08:06.782
economic consequences of divorce.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:10.564
So I came to realize that I don't think
this is recklessness;

00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:12.264
I think it's caution.

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.813
Today's singles want to know
every single thing about a partner

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:19.466
before they wed.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.419
You learn a lot between the sheets,

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:23.955
not only about how somebody makes love,

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.349
but whether they're kind,

00:08:25.373 --> 00:08:26.715
whether they can listen

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:27.911
and at my age,

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:29.713
whether they've got a sense of humor.

00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:31.140
(Laughter)
