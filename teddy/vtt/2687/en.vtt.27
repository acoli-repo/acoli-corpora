00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:31.483
the meaning we make out of it --

00:13:31.507 --> 00:13:33.832
the rules that govern
our relationships, I think,

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.883
are changing fundamentally.

00:13:35.907 --> 00:13:38.807
We come from a model that, until now,

00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.294
was primarily regulated
around duty and obligation,

00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:44.715
the needs of the collective and loyalty.

00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:45.919
And we have shifted it

00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:50.273
to a model of free choice
and individual rights,

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:53.373
and self-fulfillment and happiness.

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:55.717
And so, that was
the first thing I thought,

00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:57.509
that the need doesn't change,

00:13:57.533 --> 00:14:01.341
but the context and the way
we regulate these relationships
