00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:10.625
and the playfulness, I think,

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:13.360
to be able to have so many options.

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:14.745

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:26.497
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt

00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:29.070
that comes with this massa of choice,

00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:31.353
creating a case of "FOMO"
