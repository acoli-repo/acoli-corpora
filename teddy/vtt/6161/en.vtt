00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:04.016
Growing up in central Wisconsin,
I spent a lot of time outside.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.087
In the spring, I'd smell
the heady fragrance of lilacs.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.331
In the summer, I loved
the electric glow of fireflies

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:12.529
as they would zip around on muggy nights.

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.029
In the fall, the bogs were brimming
with the bright red of cranberries.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:18.553
Even winter had its charms,

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:21.149
with the Christmassy bouquet
emanating from pine trees.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.339
For me, nature has always been
a source of wonder and inspiration.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.347
As I went on to graduate school
in chemistry, and in later years,

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.497
I came to better understand
the natural world in molecular detail.
