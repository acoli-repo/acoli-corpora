AG: Which means that when
you're considering career paths,

00:15:04.411 --> 00:15:07.348
you shouldn't claim to your old ideas
of what your passion is.

00:15:07.372 --> 00:15:10.942
Don't pursue the job that your past self
thought would make you happiest.

00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:14.474
Follow your curiosity into the job
where you think you'll learn the most.

00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:18.250
Or you can gain mastery over useful skills
and build your passion over time.

MK: I think my best advice
is to be open-minded,

00:15:22.238 --> 00:15:24.182
rather than narrowly focused

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:26.560
and thinking, "This is the way
my life has to go,

00:15:26.584 --> 00:15:28.031
this is what I have to do."

00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:30.081
AG: Maria is still a psychology writer.
