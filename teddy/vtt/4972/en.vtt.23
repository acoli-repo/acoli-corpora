00:11:27.363 --> 00:11:30.450
the voluntary obsession,
the full commitment

00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:33.102
that people have in their careers

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.846
other than passion, loving what you do.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.617
But I don't love the "follow" part.

00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:41.974
It sounds like it's out there
and you just have to discover it,

00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:44.982
and if you don't feel like
you have passion for your work,

00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:48.521
you missed it somehow
or you have to keep looking for it,

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:50.467
as if it were a whole thing

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:53.173
and not something that gradually
develops over time

00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:55.962
and I think that's actually
the better verb,

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:58.492
that you should develop
your passion, not follow it.

00:11:58.974 --> 00:12:02.490
AG: Some of Angela's colleagues
have recently gathered evidence for that.
