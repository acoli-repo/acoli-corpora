00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:00.141
AD: For so many people,

00:13:00.165 --> 00:13:03.514
the first year on the job
is not a great year.

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:06.149
And it would be very easy
to get discouraged and think,

00:13:06.173 --> 00:13:11.125
"Oh, I thought medicine was for me,"
or law or marketing or whatever,

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:12.395
"but I guess not."

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.022
AG: So, Angela has a rule:

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:16.156
you don't quit on a bad day.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.803
AD: You should not quit things
when you're in that acute period

00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:24.220
of pain and disappointment and self-doubt.

00:13:24.244 --> 00:13:26.672
I always recommend
quitting things on good days.

00:13:26.696 --> 00:13:29.379
You know, if you come in
and it's a nice Thursday morning

00:13:29.403 --> 00:13:32.609
and everything is going reasonably well,
and you still want to quit,
