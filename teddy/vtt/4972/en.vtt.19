00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:31.490
and I was acting a little bit
like a fish out of water,

00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:34.047
I was wriggling and gasping for breath.

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.491
AG: But then, something strange happened.

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.331
MK: You know, my hands stopped shaking

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:40.824
whenever I would get
a certain type of hand.

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:41.871
(Laughs)

00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:45.929
And I started being able
to stack my chips properly.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.831
AG: Maria was actually
becoming really good.

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.255
She started winning, and winning big.

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:56.553
One day, she won a major
international tournament,

00:09:56.577 --> 00:10:00.768
beating more than 200 pros
and earning thousands of dollars.
