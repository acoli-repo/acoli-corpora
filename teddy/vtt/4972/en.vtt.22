Angela Duckworth: "Follow your bliss."

00:11:00.146 --> 00:11:02.371
I think it's half right and half wrong.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.315
AG: That's Angela Duckworth,
a fellow psychologist at Penn.

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:09.352
She's best known for her research
that put the concept of grit on the map.

00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:13.010
Angela defines grit as passion
and perseverance toward a long-term goal.

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.241
AD: It's one thing to have a work ethic,

00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:17.954
but to have all of that
without the guiding passion

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:19.776
is really awful.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.012
AG: But she doesn't think
"follow your passion"

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.379
is good career advice.

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:24.752
AD: I like the passion part.

00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:27.339
There's no other way to describe

00:11:27.363 --> 00:11:30.450
the voluntary obsession,
the full commitment
