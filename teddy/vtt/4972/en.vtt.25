when they try something
like reading a difficult passage

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.780
on a topic that was initially interesting.

00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:38.495
Very quickly, that interest falls off
if you have that mind-set.

00:12:38.876 --> 00:12:41.606

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.124

00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:45.124
It assumes your interests are stable.

00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:48.076
So if you don't immediately enjoy
a field or a task,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.441

00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:51.465
this must not be your passion.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.093
But that's a mistake.

00:12:54.117 --> 00:12:56.696
You don't want to quit
the moment you don't like a job,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.760
because passion can grow over time.

00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:00.141
