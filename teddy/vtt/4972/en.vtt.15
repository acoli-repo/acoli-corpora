AG: When you set your sights on a passion,
you sometimes get tunnel vision.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.268
You focus on that single direction,

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:36.831
forgetting that you have
multiple interests.

00:07:37.132 --> 00:07:40.537
Now, Maria wasn't blindly
following her passion for writing.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:44.093
She was pursuing a different interest,
which would give her a new skill set

00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:46.610
and some content expertise
for her writing.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:50.157
MK: Just following your passion,
I think, is pretty bad advice.

00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.369
And if I was just following my passion,

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:54.726
I never would have gone to grad school,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.869
because it would have just been, you know,
"Let's just try this writing thing."
