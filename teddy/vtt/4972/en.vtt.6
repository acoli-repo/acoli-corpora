00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.434
And there's also the question of talent.

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:03.831
Not everyone can be anything.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.214
Don't just take it from me.

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:09.349
Take it from the great
psychologist Chris Rock,

00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:11.816
in his hilarious Netflix
special "Tamborine."

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.543
(Clip) Chris Rock: This lady
comes up and goes,

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:15.997
"I want you children to know

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:18.571

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:21.863
Like, lady, why are you lying
to these children?

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:23.014
(Laughter)

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:26.037
Maybe four of them
could be anything they want to be.

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:28.189
(Laughter)

00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:31.475
But the other 2,000
better learn how to weld.
