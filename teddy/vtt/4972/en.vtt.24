AG: Some of Angela's colleagues
have recently gathered evidence for that.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.434
When people try to follow their passion,

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:07.149
they were less likely to consider
other areas of interest

00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:08.546
where passion could develop,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.691
and less likely
to anticipate difficulties.

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.776
And when they did run into obstacles,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.307
they were more likely
to lose interest and give up.

00:12:18.673 --> 00:12:21.649

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:22.839
they're, like, in you,

00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:25.535
you just have to poke around
for a while and get to it,

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:29.044
they are much more likely, for example,
to get easily discouraged

00:12:29.068 --> 00:12:32.145
when they try something
like reading a difficult passage
