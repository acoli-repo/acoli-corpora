Maria finally ended up
working as a TV producer for two years.

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:05.610
Although she was toying
with the idea of becoming a journalist,

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.953
she started opening her mind
to other interests.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:11.421
And she kept coming back to psychology,
which was her college major.

00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:15.658
MK: I've always thought that psychology
and writing just go hand in hand,

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:19.276
that the best psychologists in the world
are writers and vice versa.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.219
AG: So she quit her job
to pursue a PhD in psychology.

00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:26.236
MK: I really wanted to learn more
about how the mind works

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.910
and how people think.

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:31.553
AG: When you set your sights on a passion,
you sometimes get tunnel vision.
