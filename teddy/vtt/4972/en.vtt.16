AG: In 2013, as she was
finishing her doctorate,

00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:06.783
Maria published her first "New Yorker"
article on psychology.

00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:09.370
Then she landed a role there
as a contributing writer.

00:08:10.053 --> 00:08:13.188
Over the next few years,
she kept expanding her peripheral vision.

00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.307
And in 2017,

00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:18.839
her career took a turn
that she never would have anticipated.

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:21.744
While researching a book
on the psychology of chance,

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:23.888
Maria stumbled onto the topic of poker.

00:08:24.228 --> 00:08:27.704
She decided to learn about the game
as a metaphor for chance and control.

00:08:27.728 --> 00:08:30.434
MK: I said, "I'm going to learn
how to play poker."
