AG: And Lin Manuel-Miranda in 2016,

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.950
talking about what it's like
to search for your career passion.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:06.482
Lin Manuel-Miranda: The stories
you are about to live

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:09.557
are the ones you will be telling
your children and grandchildren,

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:10.731
and therapists.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.839
They are the temp gigs and internships
before you find your passion.

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:19.331
AG: But when a graduation speaker
says "follow your passion,"

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:22.747
I find myself wondering,
is it actually good advice?

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.416
And is everyone using
the same speech writer?

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.593
I can't answer that question.

00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:31.786
But I'm convinced that the answer
to the first one is no.
