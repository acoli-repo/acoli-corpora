Chances are you spend the majority
of your waking hours at work.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.459
It would be a tragedy

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:35.386
to devote so much time
to something you hate.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.474
But the reality is that many people
don't know what they love to do.

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:40.766
And even if you do,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.704
most passions don't translate
neatly into careers.

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:44.895
When I got to college,

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.719
my two strongest passions
were diving and magic.

00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:51.434
Not clear that those jobs
would pay the bills.

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:52.887

00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.490
For many people around the world,
passionate work is a luxury,

00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:58.447
while income is a necessity.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.434
And there's also the question of talent.
