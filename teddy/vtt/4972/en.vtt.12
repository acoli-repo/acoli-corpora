00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:00.984
AG: Bartending.

00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:02.738
MK: I did get a lot of good stories,

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.307
but I would sleep through the day
rather than writing.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.522
AG: A newsletter for men.

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:09.555
MK: Yeah, I did not want to be writing
about the hottest new bar

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:12.496
for guys to bring their bros.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.901
It took me many, many years

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:17.339
before I started being able to make
my living as a writer.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.711
AG: What was the emotional roller-coaster
of that journey like?

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.506
MK: In the moment, it was miserable.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.886
I definitely remember just having
these moments of complete desperation

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.966
where I thought,
"I can't go back to this job."
