00:09:56.577 --> 00:10:00.768
beating more than 200 pros
and earning thousands of dollars.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:03.029
(Clip) Congrats! (Applause)

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:05.683
Reporter: Did you start poker
from scratch a year ago?

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:09.492
MK: I did, and I'm really excited,
because I just won almost 85,000 dollars.

00:10:09.516 --> 00:10:11.347
I've been studying my ass off.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.807
I still remember the moment that I won,
that was just a completely surreal thing.

00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:20.268
And that was a year
after I started playing seriously.

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:25.050
Now it's become one of my main passions
and it goes even beyond that.

00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:27.208
I'm one of poker's
most passionate advocates,

00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:29.311
I think everyone
should learn to play poker,

00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:31.696
I think kids should be learning
how to play poker,
