Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.256
(Laughter)

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.896
Deborah Willis: And I'm Hank's mom.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.856
HWT: We've said that so many times,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.616
we've made a piece about it.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.296
It's called "Sometimes
I See Myself In You,"

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.576
and it speaks to
the symbiotic relationship

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.536
that we've developed over the years
through our life and work.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.696
And really, it's because everywhere we go,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.016
together or apart,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.280
we carry these monikers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.096
I've been following
in my mother's footsteps

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.696
since before I was even born

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.800
and haven't figured out how to stop.
