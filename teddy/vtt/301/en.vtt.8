00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We really tried to understand the end user,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in this case, people like Sevitha.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We tried to understand the root of the problem

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
rather than being biased by what already exists.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to address this problem.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
