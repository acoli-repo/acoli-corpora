00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if these babies were just kept warm.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That is the primary function of an incubator.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But traditional incubators require electricity

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As a result, parents resort to local solutions

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.
