00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
of almost a million babies.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This seems counterintuitive,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
population sizes also decrease,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because parents don't need to anticipate

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that their babies are going to die.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and other simple innovations like this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
represent a new trend for the future of technology:

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
simple, localized, affordable solutions

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.
