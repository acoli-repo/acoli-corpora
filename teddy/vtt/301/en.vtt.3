00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and the doctor advised her to take Rani

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But that hospital was over four hours away,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so her baby died.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
something that could work without electricity,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,
