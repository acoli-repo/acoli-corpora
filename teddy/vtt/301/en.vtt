Please close your eyes,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and open your hands.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
an apple, maybe your wallet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now open your eyes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What about a life?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What you see here is a premature baby.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
enough fat on his body to stay warm.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Sadly, 20 million babies like this
