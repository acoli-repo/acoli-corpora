00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and it creates a warm micro-environment

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for the baby.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
less than 0.1 percent of the cost

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of a traditional incubator.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
of almost a million babies.
