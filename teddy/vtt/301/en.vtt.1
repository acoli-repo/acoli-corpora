00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Sadly, 20 million babies like this

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are born every year around the world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Four million of these babies die annually.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
its only job is to grow.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
resulting in a range of health problems

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from diabetes, to heart disease,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to low I.Q.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if these babies were just kept warm.
