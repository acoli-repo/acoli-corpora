00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We needed something that was portable,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and something ultra-low-cost,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
compared to the 20,000 dollars

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, this is what we came up with.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.
