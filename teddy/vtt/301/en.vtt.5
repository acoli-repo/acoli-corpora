There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This is a phase-change material.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can melt this simply using hot water

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for four to six hours at a time,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
after which you simply reheat the pouch.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and it creates a warm micro-environment
