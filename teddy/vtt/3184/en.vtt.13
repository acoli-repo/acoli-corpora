00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:30.707
and then the average income
of all the dropouts

00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.497
from Stanford graduate programs.

00:06:32.521 --> 00:06:33.682
(Laughter)

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:36.204
I must tell you -- this chart
was definitely skewed

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:37.759
by the founders of Google.

00:06:37.783 --> 00:06:38.806
(Laughter)

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.918

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.183

00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:45.503
"Oh, for you -- follow your passion."

00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.461
(Laughter)

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:48.692
Hi, Mom.

00:06:50.132 --> 00:06:56.656
Now, today my identity quest
is no longer to find my tribe.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.144
It's more about allowing myself

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:03.281
to embrace all of the possible
permutations of myself
