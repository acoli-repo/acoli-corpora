00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:01.054
my Spanish literature teacher
came into the room.

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:03.065
She scanned all of my classmates,

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.264
and she said,

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:06.837
"You -- you have to get a tutor,

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.720
otherwise, you won't pass this class."

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:13.606
But by then I was fluent
in Spanish already,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.642
so it felt as though I could be
either Korean or Argentinian,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.672
but not both.

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:23.239
It felt like a zero-sum game,

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:26.200
where I had to give up my old identity

00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:29.784
to be able to gain or earn a new one.
