00:04:58.544 --> 00:05:02.402
I started as an inventor,
entrepreneur, social innovator.

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:05.694
Then I became an investor,

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:06.940
a woman in tech,

00:05:06.964 --> 00:05:08.223
a teacher.

00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:11.193
And most recently, I became a mom,

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:14.623
or as my toddler says repeatedly,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.649
"Mom!" day and night.

00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:23.715
Even my accent was so confused --

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.191
its origin was so obscure,

00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.165
that my friends called it, "Rebecanese."

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:30.665
