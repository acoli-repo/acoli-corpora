00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:35.384
So when I was 18,
I decided to go to Korea,

00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:39.462
hoping that finally I could find
a place to call home.

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:41.483
But there people asked me,

00:02:41.507 --> 00:02:44.903
"Why do you speak Korean
with a Spanish accent?"

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:45.951
(Laughter)

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:49.470
And, "You must be Japanese
because of your big eyes

00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:51.504
and your foreign body language."

00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.924
And so it turns out that I was
too Korean to be Argentinian,

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:59.078
but too Argentinian to be Korean.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.237
And this was a pivotal realization to me.
