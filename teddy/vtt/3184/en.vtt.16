00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.491
I hope that instead of feeling
anxious and worried

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.595
that they don't fit in that one box

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:08.345
or that their identity will become
irrelevant someday,

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:11.134
that they can feel free to experiment

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:16.583
and to take control of their personal
narrative and identity.

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.492
I also hope that they will use
their unique combination

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:25.825
of values and languages
and cultures and skills

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:27.499
to help create a world

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:33.300
where identities are no longer used
to alienate what looks different,
