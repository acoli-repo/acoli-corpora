00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:30.155
So this episode launched
a lifelong quest for my identity.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.746
I was born in Korea -- the land of kimchi;

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.604
raised in Argentina,

00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:42.295
where I ate so much steak
that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now;

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.437
and I was educated in the US,

00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:46.783
where I became addicted to peanut butter.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:48.386
(Laughter)

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.344
During my childhood,
I felt very much Argentinian,

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:55.028
but my looks betrayed me at times.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:58.322
I remember on the first day
of middle school,

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:01.054
my Spanish literature teacher
came into the room.
