00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:31.302
where skills could become
obsolete overnight.

00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:38.066
So I stopped looking
for that 100 percent commonality

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.586
with the people that I met.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.047
Instead, I realized that oftentimes,
I was the only overlap

00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:50.083
between groups of people that were
usually in conflict with each other.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.048
So with this realization in mind,

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:58.265
I decided to embrace all
of the different versions of myself --

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:02.780
even allow myself
to reinvent myself at times.
