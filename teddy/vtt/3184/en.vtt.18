It turns out that it was never
about going back to Korea

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:03.358
and being buried there.

00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:07.051
It was about resting next to her son,

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:10.776
who had died long before
she moved to Argentina.

00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:15.589
What mattered to her was not the ocean

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:18.997
that divided her past and new world;

00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:25.527
it was about finding common ground.

00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:27.056
Thank you.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.640
