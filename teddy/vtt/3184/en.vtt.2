00:00:57.076 --> 00:01:01.282
And upon arrival, we were immigrants
who had lost everything,

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:04.807
so we had to work really hard
to rebuild our lives.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.455
So it hadn't occurred to me
that after all these years,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.422
back home was still in Korea.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.649
It made me ponder where I would want
to be buried someday,

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:18.568
where home was for me,

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.159
and the answer was not obvious.

00:01:21.183 --> 00:01:23.502
And this really bothered me.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:30.155
So this episode launched
a lifelong quest for my identity.
