00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.222
But it was MIT,

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:33.901
so I don't know if I can take
too much credit for that.

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:35.530
As they say over there,

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:37.881
"The odds are good,

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.382
but the goods are odd."

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.348
(Laughter)

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.833
I switched majors so many times
that my advisors joked

00:04:46.857 --> 00:04:49.716
that I should get a degree
in "random studies."

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.520
(Laughter)

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:53.203
I told this to my kids.

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:57.802
And then over the years, I have gained
a lot of different identities.

00:04:58.544 --> 00:05:02.402
I started as an inventor,
entrepreneur, social innovator.
