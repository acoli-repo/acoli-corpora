to embrace all of the possible
permutations of myself

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:08.537
and cultivating diversity within me

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.795
and not just around me.

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:15.382
My boys now are three years
and five months old today,

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:18.872
and they were already born
with three nationalities

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:20.391
and four languages.

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.536
I should mention now that my husband
is actually from Denmark --

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.389
just in case I don't have enough
culture shocks in my life,

00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:30.429
I decided to marry a Danish guy.
