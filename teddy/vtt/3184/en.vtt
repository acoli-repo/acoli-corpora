00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:02.644
We're holding hands,

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.032
staring at the door.

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:07.312
My siblings and I were waiting
for my mother to come back

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:08.798
from the hospital.

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:12.529
She was there because my grandmother
had cancer surgery that day.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.521
Finally, the doors opened,

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:18.598
and she said,

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:19.830
"She's gone.

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:21.004
She's gone."

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:24.310
She started sobbing and immediately said,

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:26.524
"We must make arrangements.

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:32.193
Your grandmother's dying wish
was to be buried back home in Korea."
