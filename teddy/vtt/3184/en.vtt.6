00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.237
And this was a pivotal realization to me.

00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:08.597
I had failed to find that place
in the world to call home.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:14.141
But how many Japanese-looking Koreans
who speak with a Spanish accent --

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:17.164
or even more specific,
Argentinian accent --

00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:18.845
do you think are out there?

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.254
Perhaps this could be an advantage.

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:24.879
It was easy for me to stand out,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.231
which couldn't hurt in a world
that was rapidly changing,

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:31.302
where skills could become
obsolete overnight.
