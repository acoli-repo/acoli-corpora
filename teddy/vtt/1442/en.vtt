00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This cell phone

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
started its trajectory

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in an artisanal mine

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in the Eastern Congo.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's mined by armed gangs

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
using slaves, child slaves,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what the U.N. Security Council

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
calls "blood minerals,"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then traveled into some components

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and ended up in a factory

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in Shinjin in China.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
already this year.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
