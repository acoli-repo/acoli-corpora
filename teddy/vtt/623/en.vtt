I've been a political cartoonist
on the global stage for the last 20 years.

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.212
Hey, we have seen a lot of things
happen in those 20 years.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.020
We saw three different Catholic popes,

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.346
and we witnessed that unique moment:

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.000
the election of a pope
on St. Peter's Square --

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:24.320
you know, the little white smoke

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:27.641
and the official announcement.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:29.022
[It's a boy!]

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:31.232
