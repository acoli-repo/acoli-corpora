00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
especially at the end of these balloon flights

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
around the world I did with Brian Jones.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I took this picture,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And on the other side there was a rising sun.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, you see that on the other side of ice

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you have the unknown,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you have the non-obvious,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you have the non-seen,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for the people who don't dare
