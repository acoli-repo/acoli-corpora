00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.944
and then stop for half an hour

00:07:00.944 --> 00:07:02.309
and then keep going.

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.591
That's the natural cadence of a trip.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.972
CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:12.614
You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.

00:07:12.614 --> 00:07:15.126
What's unusual about that?

00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:17.486
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:21.126
we have to have sustainable electricity production

00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.774
as well as consumption,

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:26.596
so I'm quite confident that the primary means

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.077
of power generation will be solar.

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.412
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.
