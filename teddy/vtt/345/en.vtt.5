00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.900
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.227
a really energy efficient car,

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.084
so that means making it incredibly light,

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.110
and so what you're seeing here

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.856
is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:40.442
made in North America.

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:43.130
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.747
to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

00:02:46.747 --> 00:02:48.907
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:50.275
of any car of its size.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.940
So as a result, the energy usage is very low,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.156
and it has the most advanced battery pack,

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.740
and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.679
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.
