00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.226
independent of environmental concerns.

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:33.143
In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:36.223
given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.278
we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:44.288
CA: Most of American electricity comes from

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.950
burning fossil fuels.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.565
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?

00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:53.524
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:56.484
One is that, even if you take the same source fuel

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:58.473
and produce power at the power plant

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.367
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.
