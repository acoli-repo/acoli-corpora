00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:33.908
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)

00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.700
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.503
so in roughly 18 years,

00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:42.060
I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.829
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.045
with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:50.822
You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.

00:11:50.822 --> 00:11:53.258
You decided to build a space company.

00:11:53.258 --> 00:11:55.331
Why on Earth would someone do that?

00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:57.511
(Laughter)

00:11:57.511 --> 00:12:00.324
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.
