00:04:58.085 --> 00:05:01.035
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:04.034
Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.

00:05:04.034 --> 00:05:06.138
And our third generation car, which should hopefully

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:07.867
be out in about three or four years

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.522
will be a $30,000 car.

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:13.004
But whenever you've got really new technology,

00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:15.098
it generally takes about three major versions

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:18.318
in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.042
And so I think we're making progress in that direction,

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.314
and I feel confident that we'll get there.

00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:25.223
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,

00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:28.971
you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:33.218
There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.
