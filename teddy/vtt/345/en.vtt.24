00:11:57.511 --> 00:12:00.324
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.

00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:02.583
People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.484
who made a small fortune in the space industry?"

00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:09.732
Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.

00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:12.278
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out

00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:14.565
the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.

00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:17.606
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:22.668
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?

00:12:22.668 --> 00:12:25.850
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.600
We came very close to failure,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.734
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.
