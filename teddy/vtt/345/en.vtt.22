00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:04.046
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:09.844
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,

00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:11.956
and most likely a majority,

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:17.216
and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:20.684
I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.430
EM: More from solar than any other source.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.188
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?

00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:29.588
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:33.908
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)
