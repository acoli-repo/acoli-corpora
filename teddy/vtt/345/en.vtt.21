00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:32.812
is a giant distributed utility.

00:10:32.812 --> 00:10:35.695
I think it's a good thing, because utilities

00:10:35.695 --> 00:10:38.532
have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.

00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:40.627
So effectively it's the first time

00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:43.892
there's been competition for this monopoly,

00:10:43.892 --> 00:10:46.892
because the utilities have been the only ones

00:10:46.892 --> 00:10:49.539
that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:51.430
So I think it's actually very empowering

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.067
for homeowners and businesses.

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:55.425
CA: And you really picture a future

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:59.344
where a majority of power in America,

00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:04.046
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?
