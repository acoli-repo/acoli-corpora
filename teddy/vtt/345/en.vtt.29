CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:36.155
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that

00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:37.697
they're all expendable.

00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:39.959
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:42.093
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,

00:14:42.093 --> 00:14:45.019
but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:47.115
and the parts that were reusable

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:52.171
took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.

00:14:52.171 --> 00:14:55.757
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

00:14:55.757 --> 00:14:57.939
Obviously that doesn't work very well for —

CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?
