00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.679
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.268
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.539
but you think the math can still work out intelligently --

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.675
by combining light body, heavy battery,

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.948
you can still gain spectacular efficiency.

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.780
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.541
to offset the mass of the pack,

00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.570
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.295
And in fact, customers of the Model S

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:24.374
are sort of competing with each other

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:27.393
to try to get the highest possible range.

00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:30.923
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.
