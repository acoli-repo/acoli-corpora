00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.548
which, if we could play that first video --

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:07.492
So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:11.068
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.138
and I should say that I think, actually,

00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:15.596
all modes of transport will become fully electric

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:20.663
with the ironic exception of rockets.

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:23.420
There's just no way around Newton's third law.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.872
The question is how do you accelerate

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.452
the advent of electric transport?

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.900
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with
