00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.734
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:36.884
The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,

00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.838
and in particular to try to crack a problem

00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:40.422
that I think is vital

00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:42.449
for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:47.333
which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:50.424
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?

00:12:50.424 --> 00:12:54.438
So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?

00:12:54.438 --> 00:12:57.817
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?

00:12:57.817 --> 00:12:59.953
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,

00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:01.349
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.
