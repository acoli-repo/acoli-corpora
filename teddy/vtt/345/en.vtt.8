Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:04.382
What is the most surprising thing about the experience

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:05.890
of driving the car?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.368
EM: In creating an electric car,

00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:09.766
the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.453
So we wanted really to have people feel as though

00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:14.556
they've almost got to mind meld with the car,

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:17.730
so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.776
and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:23.610
like the car has ESP.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.106
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.

00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:28.233
You can't do that with a gasoline car.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.215
I think that's really a profound difference,
