00:09:54.783 --> 00:10:00.670
SolarCity raises a chunk of capital

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.340
from say, a company or a bank.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.553
Google is one of our big partners here.

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.977
And they have an expected return on that capital.

00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:13.363
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:16.809
and then charges the homeowner or business owner

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:20.519
a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:24.032
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.

00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:27.796
You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.

00:10:27.796 --> 00:10:29.471
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to

00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:32.812
is a giant distributed utility.
