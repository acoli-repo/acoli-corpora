00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.652
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:35.056
even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:37.528
charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:39.639
CA: That scale delivers efficiency.

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.378
EM: Yes, it does.

00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:44.396
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.799
of power generation anyway, electricity generation.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.868
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:53.333
then it makes sense for us to have electric cars

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.908
as the mode of transport.

00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:57.343
CA: So we've got some video here

00:01:57.343 --> 00:01:59.834
of the Tesla being assembled,

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.548
which, if we could play that first video --
