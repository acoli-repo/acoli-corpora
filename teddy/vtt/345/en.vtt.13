00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.558
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:32.297
hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.

00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:35.654
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:39.630
So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.597
Wait for an hour, but the good news is,

00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:43.036
you're helping save the planet,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.729
and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.593
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people

00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:51.118
to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.

00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:58.846
It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.944
and then stop for half an hour
