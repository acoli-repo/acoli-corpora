00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.367
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:03.346
So if you take, say, natural gas,

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.954
which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:08.952
if you burn that in a modern

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:11.147
General Electric natural gas turbine,

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.985
you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:15.696
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.596
you get about 20 percent efficiency.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:19.176
And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:21.544
you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:23.259
is voluminous,

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.713
and you can take the waste heat

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:26.082
and run a steam turbine and generate

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.866
a secondary power source.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.652
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,
