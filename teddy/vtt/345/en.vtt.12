00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.514
and we've got the Eastern seaboard

00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:02.766
from Boston to D.C. covered.

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:04.148
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive

00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:06.291
from L.A. to New York

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.893
just using the Supercharger network,

00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:12.110
which charges at five times the rate of anything else.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.536
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:19.535
to stop time, of about six or seven.

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:21.765
So if you drive for three hours,

00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:23.403
you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.900
because that's normally what people will stop for.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.020
So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.558
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,
