00:15:29.483 --> 00:15:31.635
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:34.475
roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:37.555
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.

00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:38.995
That's why it's so important.

00:15:38.995 --> 00:15:41.217
Every mode of transport that we use,

00:15:41.217 --> 00:15:44.147
whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,

00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:46.483
is reusable, but not rockets.

00:15:46.483 --> 00:15:49.771
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:51.238
CA: You asked me the question earlier

00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:55.033
of how popular traveling on cruises would be

00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:01.168
if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.
