00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:01.349
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.

00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:03.334
It was really more from the standpoint of

00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:07.204
what are the things that need to happen in order for

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:10.024
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:14.113
And I really think there's a fundamental difference,

00:13:14.113 --> 00:13:15.509
if you sort of look into the future,

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:18.966
between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:22.081
that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,

00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:24.293
and I think that's really exciting,

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:27.464

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:29.752
until some eventual extinction event.

CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building
