00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.412
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:34.646
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:37.538
and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:40.414
for purposes of human civilization.

00:07:40.414 --> 00:07:42.420
What most people know but don't realize they know

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.774
is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.

00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:49.014
If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:51.176
at three degrees Kelvin,

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:54.974
and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.630
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.981
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.245
effectively, thousands of years of sun power
