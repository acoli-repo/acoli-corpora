because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.

00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:05.103
And we've made huge progress in that direction,

00:09:05.103 --> 00:09:08.671
and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.

00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:11.448
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:13.664
don't pay so much up front.

00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:16.344
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.

00:09:16.344 --> 00:09:18.983

00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:22.584
You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:25.828
EM: Typical leases are 20 years,

00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:30.491
but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.
