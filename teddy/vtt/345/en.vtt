Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.642
would persuade you to think of trying

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:09.000
to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.402
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.554
I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.626
to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.118
I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:23.477
and sustainable energy production.

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.522
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.021
is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.226
independent of environmental concerns.
