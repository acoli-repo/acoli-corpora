CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building

00:13:31.504 --> 00:13:34.848
a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:37.127
How on Earth have you done that?

00:13:37.127 --> 00:13:40.238
NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.639
EM: Well, we've made significant advances

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.402
in the technology of the airframe, the engines,

00:13:45.402 --> 00:13:48.623
the electronics and the launch operation.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:51.344
There's a long list of innovations

00:13:51.344 --> 00:13:53.512
that we've come up with there

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:59.187
that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --

00:13:59.187 --> 00:14:02.600
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?
