00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.215
I think that's really a profound difference,

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:33.002
and people only experience that when they have a test drive.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:37.296
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.871
Is there a road map where this becomes

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.450
a mass-market vehicle?

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.010
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.282
to have a sort of three-step process,

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:51.048
where version one was an expensive car at low volume,

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:54.113
version two is medium priced and medium volume,

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:56.402
and then version three would be low price, high volume.

00:04:56.402 --> 00:04:58.085
So we're at step two at this point.

00:04:58.085 --> 00:05:01.035
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.
