I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.011
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:36.601
broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.213
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that

00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:41.027
to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:44.939
and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.829
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.467
if you drive it 65 miles an hour,

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:53.431
under normal conditions,

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.315
250 miles is a reasonable number.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:56.453
CA: Let's show that second video

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.299
showing the Tesla in action on ice.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.967
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.
