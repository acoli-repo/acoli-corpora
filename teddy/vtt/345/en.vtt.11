There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.

00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:36.058
Do you see that coming, really, truly,

than people realize,

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.770
and at Tesla we developed something

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.978
called a Supercharging technology,

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:51.290

We actually have California and Nevada covered,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.514
and we've got the Eastern seaboard
