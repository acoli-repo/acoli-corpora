I'm Michael Shermer,
director of the Skeptics Society,

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.088
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.025
We investigate claims of the paranormal,

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.731
pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,
and claims of all kinds between,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:12.649
science and pseudo-science
and non-science and junk science,

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:15.976
voodoo science, pathological science,
bad science, non-science,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.887
and plain old non-sense.

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.828
And unless you've been on Mars recently,

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.870
you know there's a lot of that out there.

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.916
Some people call us debunkers,
which is kind of a negative term.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.048
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:30.525
We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there --
