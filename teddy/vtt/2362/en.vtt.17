00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.809
pulling in and fanning out

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:33.845
in a way that the eye just can't capture,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.219
or in this case,

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:42.280
a fish throwing up grains of sand.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.670
This is an actual sailfin goby,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.186
and if you look at it in real time,

00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:50.191
it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion

00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:53.362
because it's so quick.

00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:55.634
One of the most precious gifts
that we had underwater

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:57.974
is that we had WiFi,

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:00.190
and for 31 days straight we were able to connect
