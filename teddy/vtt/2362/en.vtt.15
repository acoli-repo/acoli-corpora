00:07:28.613 --> 00:07:30.571
right next to for 31 days

00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.280
and never normally would have paid attention to,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.160
such as hermit crabs.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.175
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology

00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:40.300
that's not really meant for the oceans

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.444
is not always easy.

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:44.992
We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:47.552
cordon it back to the lab,

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.073
and actually man the trigger

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.247
from the lab itself.

00:07:52.247 --> 00:07:54.441
But what this gives us

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.275
is the foresight to look at and analyze

00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.482
in scientific and engineering terms
