00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.482
in scientific and engineering terms

00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:03.646
some of the most amazing behavior

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:04.901
that the human eye just can't pick up,

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.950
such as this manta shrimp

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.718
trying to catch its prey,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:15.217
within about .3 seconds.

00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:18.312
That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,

00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:19.657
and if you ever try to catch a bullet

00:08:19.657 --> 00:08:23.675
in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:24.978
But now we can see things

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:27.648
such as these Christmas tree worms

00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.809
pulling in and fanning out
