I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.974
but until we can go there,

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:07.440
I think the oceans still hold

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.879
quite a few secrets.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.243
As a matter of fact,

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.798
if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:17.429
and dissect it into a living space,

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.824
the ocean represents over 3.4 billion

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.311
cubic kilometers of volume, within which

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.821
we've explored less than five percent.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.080
And I look at this, and I go, well,
