00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:01.673
up to 20,000 frames per second

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:03.052
in a little box

00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:04.693
that's worth 3,000 dollars.

00:07:04.693 --> 00:07:06.937
It's available to every one of us.

00:07:06.937 --> 00:07:09.655
And that particular camera gives us an insight

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:12.280
into what fairly common animals do

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.526
but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.836
Let me show you a quick video

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.906
of what this camera does.

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.741
You can see the silky bubble come out

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.920
of our hard hats.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.252
It gives us an insight

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:28.613
into some of the animals that we were sitting

00:07:28.613 --> 00:07:30.571
right next to for 31 days
