00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:32.634
such as this endangered goliath grouper

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:35.896
who only still resides in the Florida Keys.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.205
Of course, just like any neighbor,

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:40.725
after a while, if they get tired,

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:42.345
the goliath grouper barks at us,

00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.141
and this bark is so powerful

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.800
that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.769
within a split second.

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:50.286
For us, it's just telling us to go back

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:54.918
into the habitat and leave them alone.

00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:58.149
Now, this wasn't just about adventure.

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:59.978
There was actually a serious note to it.

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:03.279
We did a lot of science, and again,
because of the luxury of time,
