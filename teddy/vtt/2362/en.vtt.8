00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.184
This particular animal actually circled

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:05.335
for 31 full days during our mission.

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:07.675
So mission 31 wasn't so much

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:09.587
about breaking records.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:14.021
It was about that human-ocean connection.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.175
Because of the luxury of time, we were able

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:20.134
to study animals such as sharks and grouper

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.384
in aggregations that we've never seen before.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:26.970
It's like seeing dogs and 
cats behaving well together.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.745
Even being able to commune with animals

00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:29.872
that are much larger than us,

00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:32.634
such as this endangered goliath grouper
