00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:31.240
gauges the fluorescence of corals

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.717
as it pertains to pollutants in the water

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:37.103
as well as climate change-related issues.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:40.601
We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,

00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.930
such as this sonde, or what I like to call

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.084
the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde

00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:51.887
itself tests for metabolism rates

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:54.987
in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:57.338
or the redwoods of the [ocean].

00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:58.610
And this gives us a much better gauge

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.928
of what's happening underwater
