00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:31.844
that we have underwater cities,

00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:34.409
and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries

00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:36.343
of adventure and knowledge,

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.584
and we share that knowledge with others out there,

00:09:39.584 --> 00:09:42.731
we can solve all sorts of problems.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:44.189
My grandfather used to say,

00:09:44.189 --> 00:09:47.142
"People protect what they love."

00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:49.741
My father, "How can people protect

00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:54.665
what they don't understand?"

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:58.706
And I've thought about this my whole life.

00:09:58.706 --> 00:10:02.014
Nothing is impossible.
