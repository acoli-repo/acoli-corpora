They didn't find anything 
specifically wrong with me,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.692
other than being slightly 
dyslexic because I'm a lefty.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:39.807
But they didn't test for curiosity.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:42.388
Curiosity, to me,

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.361
is about our connection

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.606
with the world, with the universe.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.496
It's about seeing what's 
around that next coral head

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:51.195
or what's around that next tree,

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.254
and learning more not only about our environment

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.324
but about ourselves.

00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.854
Now, my dream of dreams,

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:01.128
I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,
