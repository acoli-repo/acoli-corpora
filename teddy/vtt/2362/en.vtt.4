00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:02.840
Two years ago, she was staked out

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.684
at the last undersea marine laboratory

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.667
to try and save it,

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.355
to try and petition

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.145
for us not to scrap it

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:13.546
and bring it back on land.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:15.458
We've only had about a dozen or so

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.888
scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.800
There's only one left in the world:

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.021
it's nine miles offshore

00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.355
and 65 feet down.

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:25.010
It's called Aquarius.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.382
Aquarius, in some fashion,

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.631
is a dinosaur,

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.971
an ancient robot chained to the bottom,
