00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.928
of what's happening underwater

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.863
with regard to climate change-related issues,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.651
and how the dynamics of that

00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:08.261
affect us here on land.

00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:10.743
And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:12.671
And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.168
because as we take away some of the predators

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.339
on these coral reefs around the world,

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.904
the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.

00:06:20.904 --> 00:06:22.558
What we realized is

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:25.741
not only do they stop taking care of the reef,

00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:27.665
darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:29.184
and going back into their homes,

00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:31.163
they start spreading out and disappearing
