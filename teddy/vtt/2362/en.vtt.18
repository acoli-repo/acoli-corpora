WEBVTT

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:00.190
and for 31 days straight we were able to connect

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.903
with the world in real time 
from the bottom of the sea

00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:04.735
and share all of these experiences.

00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:06.160
Quite literally right there

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.306
I am Skyping in the classroom

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:09.324
with one of the six continents

00:09:09.324 --> 00:09:12.280

As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.977
with my smartphone from underwater

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:22.508
of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.

00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:27.532
We had never seen that before.

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:29.349
And I dream of the day

00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:31.844
that we have underwater cities,
