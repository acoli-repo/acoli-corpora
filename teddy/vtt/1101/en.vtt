00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The old story about climate protection is that it's costly,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
or it would have been done already.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The new story about climate protection

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is that it's not costly, but profitable.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This was a simple sign error,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as is well known to companies that do it all the time --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity
