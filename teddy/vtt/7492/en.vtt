A traditional job interview

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.166
is basically a one-sided,
high pressure interrogation,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.146
almost guaranteed to create

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.456
significant psychological strain.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.886
Ironically, such stressful procedures

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.575
can totally obscure
a person's true potential

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.176
causing us to overlook a lot of people

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.878
who could be great employees.

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.926
We need a different way
to interview and screen candidates.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.544
One that will reveal
hidden potential and talent.
