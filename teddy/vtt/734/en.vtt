00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:02.785
It's wonderful to be here

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:04.871
to talk about my journey,

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.605
to talk about the wheelchair

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.245
and the freedom it has bought me.

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:11.882
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.016
when an extended illness

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:17.602
changed the way I could access the world.

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.979
When I started using the wheelchair,

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:22.564
it was a tremendous new freedom.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.650
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220
It was like having an enormous new toy.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.250
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
