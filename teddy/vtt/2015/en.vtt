00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There was a time in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when everything seemed perfect.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Everywhere I went, I felt at home.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Everyone I met,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I want to share with you how I came to that place

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and what I've learned since I left it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is where it began.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it raises an existential question,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
why am I not visible in the photograph,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and where is this time and place?
