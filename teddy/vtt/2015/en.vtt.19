00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The first C is cognitive training.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Unlike the smashed glass of my car,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
plasticity of the brain

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
back in the 1970's.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
