00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm looking down,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but let me tell you how I felt at that point.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I felt empty and full, hot and cold,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
euphoric and depressed

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
because the brain is the world's first

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
fully functional quantum computer;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it can occupy multiple states at the same time.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I felt everything simultaneously.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is now flash-forward to the point in time

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
where I've been discharged by the health system.
