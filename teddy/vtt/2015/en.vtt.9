00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And what I've learned since that event

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and during my recovery

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is that consciousness is under threat on this planet

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in ways it's never been under threat before.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
These are just some examples.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And the reason I'm so honored to be here

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to talk today in India

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is because India has the sad distinction

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of being the head injury capital of the world.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
That statistic is so sad.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
There is no more drastic and sudden gap created

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
between potential and actual mind
