00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
one of my father's clients

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
had a husband who worked

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
or movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I'm just going to give you an example today

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
of movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I've brought with me, from Southern California,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the FM device.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This is it being held in the hand.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It weighs less than a gram.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.
