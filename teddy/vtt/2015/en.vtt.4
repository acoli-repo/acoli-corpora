00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on the rim between my life and my death,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of inner space.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
From my family looking in from outside,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what they're trying to figure out

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
as the functioning of the brain

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that is remaining inside my head.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now to put this into a broader context,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien
