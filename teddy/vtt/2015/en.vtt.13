WEBVTT

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
into depression and disassociation

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
when we are potentially confronting

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the next great catastrophic climate shift.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
is are we going to confront and address

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
by growing our consciousness,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
or are we going to continue to retreat?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And that then might lead you

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to watch an episode one day

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
of Cedars-Sinai medical center

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This is a dense array EEG MRI

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
tracking 156 channels of information.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's not my EEG at Cedars;
