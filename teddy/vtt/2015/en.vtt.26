He then held my jaw in the right position

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This affected my entire body.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and rather a bold statement --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
How can the jaw affect the entire body? --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
let me simply point out to you,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
if I ask you tomorrow

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to put one grain of sand between your teeth

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and go for a nice long walk,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
how far would you last

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
before you had to remove that grain of sand?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That tiny misalignment.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
