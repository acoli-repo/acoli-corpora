00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Five of them would still weigh less

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
than a rupee coin.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Where does it go inside the body?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
for over 80 years.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So it goes in and it stays there.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Here are the implantation sites.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
where they're needed.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The main unit will then go inside the brain.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
will send signals in real time

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to the motor points in the relevant muscles
