00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
was miraculous.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And that was when I started to write a book,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
because I didn't think it was miraculous.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I thought there were miraculous elements,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but I also didn't think it was right

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that one should have to struggle and search for answers

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
when this is a pandemic within our society.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So from this experience of my recovery,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I want to share four particular aspects --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I call them the four C's of consciousness --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that helped me grow my potential mind

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The first C is cognitive training.
