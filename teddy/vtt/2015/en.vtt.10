00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
between potential and actual mind

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
than a severe head injury.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which means that India, unless something changes,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is accumulating a need

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
for millennia of rehabilitation.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
What you find in the United States

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
stroke every 40 seconds,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
All of these represent gaps

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
between potential mind and actual mind.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.
