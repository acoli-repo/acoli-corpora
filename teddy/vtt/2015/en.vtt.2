00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to cut apart the vehicle

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to extract the body of the driver.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And when they do, they find that behind the glass,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
they find me.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
all but two of my ribs,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
my pelvis and both arms --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And they get me to that nearby hospital,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Cedars-Sinai,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
45 units of blood --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which means full replacements of all the blood in me --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
before they're able to staunch the flow.
