tracking 156 channels of information.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's not my EEG at Cedars;

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it's your EEG tonight and last night.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's the what our minds do every night

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to digest the day

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm looking down,
