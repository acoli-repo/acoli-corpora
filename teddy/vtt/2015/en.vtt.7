that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000

And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We create an eye --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the eye that evolves through all of our history.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
