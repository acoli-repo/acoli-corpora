00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
gave my memoir a full clinical review,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
which is very unusual.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
But they felt the evidences

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that there was important, valuable information in the book,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That was a fair question

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The answer is yes, and for the first time,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
at ages seven and 11.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.
