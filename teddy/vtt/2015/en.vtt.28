00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I was told at UCLA Medical Center --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
as one sealed system.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and around that pipe are the nerves

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
That's basically it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
it bulges someplace else.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If that some place else where it bulges

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
you get a vascular migraine.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
This is a level of pain that's only known

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to other people who suffer vascular migraines.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Using this technology,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
this is mapping in three dimensions.
