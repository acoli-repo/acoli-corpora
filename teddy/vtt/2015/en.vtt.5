00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
watching the Earth from outer space,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is the Earth channel,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and your favorite show is the Human Show.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is because consciousness is so interesting.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's so unpredictable

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and so fragile.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And this is how we began.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The show began with tremendous special effects,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because there were catastrophic climate shifts --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
