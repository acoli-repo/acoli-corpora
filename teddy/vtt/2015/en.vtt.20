00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
The global perspective

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
is that up to 30 percent of children in school

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
have learning weaknesses

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that are not self-correcting,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but with appropriate treatment,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
they can be screened for and detected and corrected

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and avoid their academic failure.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
who provides that treatment or care.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
when I actually found somebody who could apply it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --
