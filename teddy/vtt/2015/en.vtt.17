00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to map three-dimensional function within the brain.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but in two dimensions I think you can see

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the beautiful symmetry and illumination

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
of a normal mind at work.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here's my brain.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
being destroyed by the stroke.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So my family, as we moved forward

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
had to try to find solutions and answers.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And during that process -- it took many years --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,
