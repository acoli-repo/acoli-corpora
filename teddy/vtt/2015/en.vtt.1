00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and where is this time and place?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is a police photo. That's actually my car.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
called Cedars-Sinai.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the situation is that a car full of paramedics

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on their way home from the hospital after work

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
have run across the wreckage,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and they've advised the police

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that there were no survivors inside the car,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to cut apart the vehicle
