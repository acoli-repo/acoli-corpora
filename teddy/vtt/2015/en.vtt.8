There's the Egyptian god Horus,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And that comes down right way to the present

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
with the dollar bill in the United States,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which has on it an eye of providence.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So watching all of this show from outer space,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you think we get it, we understand

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that the most precious resource on the blue planet

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is our consciousness.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Because it's the first thing we draw;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
we surround ourselves with images of it;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it's probably the most common image on the planet.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
