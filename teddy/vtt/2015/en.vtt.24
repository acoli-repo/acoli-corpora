00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And this person is particularly interesting.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but they still had a neurologic issue.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But that person could be identified

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
as having a learning disability.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And with accommodation, they went on to college

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and had a full life in terms of their opportunities.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Second aspect:

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I still had crushing migraine headaches.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Two elements that worked for me here

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The craniomandibular system is critical to that.
