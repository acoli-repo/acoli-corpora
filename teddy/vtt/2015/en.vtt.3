00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
before they're able to staunch the flow.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm put on full life support,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and I have a massive stroke,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and my brain drops into a coma.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now comas are measured

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
on a scale from 15 down to three.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's essentially there's no sign of life

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
from outside at all.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it is inside that deepest level of coma,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on the rim between my life and my death,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
