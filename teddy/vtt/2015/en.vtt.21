00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
how fast you can acquire information,

That's when I was discharged from the system.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
What does average I.Q. really mean?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It meant that when I was given two and a half hours

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
to take a test that anyone here
