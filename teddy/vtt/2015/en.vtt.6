00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because there were catastrophic climate shifts --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because of the Earth tilting on its axis

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and those catastrophic climate shifts,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we had to figure out how to find better food,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to grow our brains more.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So we actually grew our consciousness

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in response to this global threat.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now you also continue to watch

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as consciousness evolved to the point

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
