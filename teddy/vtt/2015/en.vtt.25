The craniomandibular system is critical to that.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And when I underwent it and found solutions,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Up to 30 percent of the population

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
that affects the entire body.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I was fortunate to find a dentist

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
who applied this entire universe

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of technology you're about to see

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the headaches pretty much resolved,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
He then held my jaw in the right position

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.
