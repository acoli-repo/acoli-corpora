00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is now flash-forward to the point in time

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
where I've been discharged by the health system.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But the system has moved me on

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because, as my family started to discover,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
there is no long-term concept

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in the health care system.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
requires a long-term perspective.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But let's take a look behind my eyes.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is a gamma radiation spec scan

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that uses gamma radiation

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
