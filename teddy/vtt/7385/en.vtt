00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.834
I was in a village in Samoa,
in the South Pacific,

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:07.045
and I don't remember
when the rain started,

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:08.504
just that it didn't stop.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.677
For more than a month,
24 hours a day, it just kept coming.

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:19.932
The rivers rose, and soon
no one or nothing could come in or out.

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:22.977
We were just there, in the flood.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:27.690
Have you or a loved one
ever been affected by flooding?

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:29.609
Think about it.
