00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:32.121
And also, the Senate's other worry,
the appearance of singularity --

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:34.269
well, it was a singularity back then.

00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:37.142
But now, do you know
how many nations have a president?

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.949
A hundred and forty-seven.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:41.523
All because they want
to sound like the guy

00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:44.099
who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.

00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:49.034
And so, in the end, the Senate won

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:51.515
and the House of Representatives lost ...

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:55.079
because nobody's going to feel that humble

00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:56.790
when they're told that they are now

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:59.846
the President of the United
States of America.
