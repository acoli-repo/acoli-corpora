00:03:58.408 --> 00:04:00.424
through the office
of the Chief Magistrate,

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.579
titles of respectability --

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:04.499
not bloody "President."

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:08.104
And that, in the intercourse
with foreign nations,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.257
the majesty of the people
of the United States

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.264
may not be hazarded
by an appearance of singularity --

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.700
i.e., we don't want to look
like bloody weirdos.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.090
Now, you can learn
three interesting things from this.

00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:25.311
First of all -- and this is my favorite --

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.771
is that, so far as I've ever
been able to find out,

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:32.099
the Senate has never formally
endorsed the title of President.
