00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:01.605
"Protector of the Liberties

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.680
of the People of the United States
of America Washington."

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:06.040
Not that catchy.

00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:08.781
Some people just wanted
to call him king --

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:10.311
it was tried and tested.

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:12.065
They weren't even being monarchical,

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.303
they had the idea that you could
be elected king for a fixed term.

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.591
And, you know, it could have worked.

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.473
And everybody got insanely bored,

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:21.571
because this debate
went on for three weeks.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.585
I read a diary of this poor senator
who just keeps coming back,

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.857
"Still on this subject."

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.410
And the reason for the delay
and the boredom

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:32.049
was that the House of Representatives
were against the Senate.
