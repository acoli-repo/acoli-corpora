(Laughter)

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.305
Now, I have no idea
what "talknophical" is.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.131
Something to do with words, I assume.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.430
But it's very important that words
are at the center of politics,

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.659
and all politicians know
they have to try and control language.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.711
It wasn't until, for example, 1771

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.158
that the British Parliament
allowed newspapers to report

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.954
the exact words that were said
in the debating chamber.

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:54.751
And this was actually
all down to the bravery

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:58.084
of a guy with the extraordinary
name of Brass Crosby,

00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.834
who took on Parliament.

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.936
And he was thrown into the Tower of London
