One of my favorite words in the whole
of the Oxford English Dictionary

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.114
is "snollygoster,"

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.784
just because it sounds so good.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.197
And what snollygoster means
is "a dishonest politician."

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.646
Although there was a 19th-century
newspaper editor

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.703
who defined it rather better when he said,

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:19.243
"A snollygoster is a fellow
who seeks office

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.850
regardless of party,
platform or principle,

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.382
and who, when he wins,

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:29.630
gets there by the sheer force
of monumental talknophical assumnancy."

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.183
