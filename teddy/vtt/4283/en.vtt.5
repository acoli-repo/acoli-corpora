00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:32.049
was that the House of Representatives
were against the Senate.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:36.290
The House of Representatives didn't want
Washington to get drunk on power.

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:39.401
They didn't want to call him "king,"
in case that gave him ideas,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.765
or his successor ideas.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.936
So they wanted to give him
the humblest, meagerest,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.607
most pathetic title
that they could think of.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:48.586
And that title ...

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:50.839
was "President."

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:52.927
(Laughter)

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.978
"President." They didn't invent the title.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.324
I mean, it existed before,

00:02:56.348 --> 00:02:59.013
but it just meant somebody
who presides over a meeting.

00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:00.920
It was like the foreman of the jury.
