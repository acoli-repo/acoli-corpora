that care for children.

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:18.488
Others know more about the living conditions there,

but still think they're a necessary evil.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.337
After all, where else would we put all of those children

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:26.488
who don't have any parents?

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.955
But 60 years of research has demonstrated

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.211
that separating children from their families
