00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:34.393
and, no surprise, gender was very rarely
the most predictive thing

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.167
to understand consumer needs.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.184
From a hundred thousand tournaments,

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.601
gender only came out
as the winning variable

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:43.125
in about five percent of them.

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.018
This is true around the world, by the way.

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.559
We did this in places
where traditional gender roles

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:50.934
are a little more pronounced,

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.018
and the conclusions were exactly the same.

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:55.976
It was a little bit more important,
gender, than five percent,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.268
but not material.

00:05:57.292 --> 00:05:59.476
So let's let that sink in for a second.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.851
No matter how you're looking
at a consumer,
