that if you know that,
you know what they need.

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.184
And there's losing variables
that are just not that practical,

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:08.393
and this matters because
in a world of limited resources,

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.809

that actually have the same needs.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.893
So why treat them differently?

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:16.518
So at this point, I know,
suspense is not killing you,

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:18.434
because I told you what the output is,

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.893
but what we found over time

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:25.434
is after 200 projects around the world --
this is covering 20 countries or more --

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:29.309
in essence we ran about
a hundred thousand of these tournaments,

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:34.393
and, no surprise, gender was very rarely
the most predictive thing
