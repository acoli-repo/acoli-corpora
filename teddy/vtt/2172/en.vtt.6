00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.393
that we still talk about this as a segment

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:03.601
when it's most likely carryover bias.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.434
In fact, I don't come
to this conclusion lightly.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:10.226
We have enough data to suggest
that gender is not the best place

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.684
to start for you to design
and target your brands.

00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.726
And I would even go one step further:

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.226
unless you are working in
a very gender-specific product category,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.559
probably anything else

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:24.143
you're hypothesizing
about your consumer right now

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.083
is going to be more useful than gender.

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:30.851
We did not set up to draw
this conclusion specifically.
