00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:30.851
We did not set up to draw
this conclusion specifically.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:32.143
We found it.

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:34.643
As consultants, our job
is to go with our clients

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.143
and understand their business

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:39.684
and try to help them find spaces
for their brands to grow.

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:44.059
And it is our belief that if you want
to find disruptive growth in the market,

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:45.851
you have to go to the consumer

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.101
and take a very agnostic view
of the consumer.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.393
You have to go and look
at them from scratch,

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:54.809
remove yourself from biases and segments
that you thought were important,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.809
just take a look to see
where the growth is.

00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.768
And we built ourselves
an algorithm precisely for that.
