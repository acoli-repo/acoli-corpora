00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.101
so there's going to be
a little bit of tension,

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.601
but that's important to know.

00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:33.893
We'll take a few dates.

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.976
Financial institutions:
that's something where we've heard a lot

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.059
about the difference
between men and women,

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.601
but actually talking about
men and women as different

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:44.226
is distracting you
from the thing that is underneath.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.476
We made it so simple
as "women don't like to invest,"

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.184
"women hate managing their money,"

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.601
"men are great and aggressive
and risk-takers,"

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:53.768
but at the end it's not
about men and women.

00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.601
It is actually a different narrative.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.893
It is about, there are people
that are excited and energized

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.476
and educated to manage their finances
