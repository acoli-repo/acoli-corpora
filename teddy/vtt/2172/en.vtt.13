If you're a food company, for example,
it's actually much more interesting to you

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.726
to know where people are eating,
who they are eating with,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.184
are they very nutritionally oriented.

00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:40.934
All of those things are actually
significantly more powerful and useful

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.393
than knowing if a person
is a man or a woman.

00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:44.809
And that matters, of course,

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:48.101
because then if you're putting
your limited budget into action,

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:51.184
then you're better off creating
solutions for different occasions

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.375
than trying to target women
versus young men.

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:57.226
Another example is alcoholic beverages.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.601
Thirty-five percent to 40 percent
of consumption in alcoholic beverages
