00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:32.184
So if you imagine this kind of blob
of big data about a person --

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.268
I'm going to oversimplify the science here

00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:37.684
but we basically built an algorithm
for statistical tournaments.

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:42.143
So a statistical tournament
is like asking this big thing of data,

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:46.768
"So, data, from everything
you know about consumers at this point,

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:49.476
what is the most
useful thing I need to know

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.518
that tells me more
about what consumers need?"

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.101
So the tournament is going
to have winners and losers.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.518
The winners are those variables,
those dimensions,

00:04:57.542 --> 00:04:59.893
that actually teach you a lot
about your consumer,

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:02.184
that if you know that,
you know what they need.
