00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.601
Thirty-five percent to 40 percent
of consumption in alcoholic beverages

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.768
around the world
actually happens with women,

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.768
but, you know, "women don't drink beer."

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.583
Those are the things
that we typically hear.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:12.601
But actually, when a man and a woman are,
for the most part, in the same location,

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:15.559
the emotional and functional needs
they have at that moment

00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:17.143
are very similar.

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.268
There's only one exception, by the way,

00:07:19.292 --> 00:07:21.059
and the exceptions exist,

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.809
where if you have a man and a woman

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:24.143
on a date,

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:26.518
the man is trying to impress the woman

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:28.851
and the woman is trying
to connect with the man,

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.101
so there's going to be
a little bit of tension,
