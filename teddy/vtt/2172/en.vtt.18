00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:01.226
that gender was not the best place to go,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.559
and actually the argument is

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.934
that at this point
it's not even a feminist push,

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.434
it's just we got used to it.

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:08.851
We got used to using gender,

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:12.018
and it's important for us
to start finding ways

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:14.226
to measure other things about consumers

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.684
so that we don't revert back to gender.

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:18.018
I am not naïve,

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:20.226
and I know there's still
going to be appetite

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.101
and certain ease around using gender,

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.184
but at least this warrants a conversation.

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.101
In your business, you have to inquire,

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:29.101
is this really the best lens
for me to grow.

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:32.643
So, if you are, like me,
a person that is in business,
