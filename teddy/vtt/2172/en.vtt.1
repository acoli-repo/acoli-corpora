00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:30.851
and we decided that one of
the Spanish-speaking networks in the US

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.893
was the best place for us to start.

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:35.851
And it wasn't until a few games
into the tournament

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.393
that a friend of mine
talks to me and says,

00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:40.559
"Why does it feel
like everything I'm seeing

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:43.833
is commercials for makeup and
household cleaning products and diets?"

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:46.768
It did feel a little bit too obvious,

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.018
and I don't know if
we were sensitive about it

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:52.184
or the fact that we were watching
with men and boys in our lives,

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.184
but it did feel a little bit too obvious

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.226
that we're being targeted for being women.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.809
And to be honest there's nothing
necessarily wrong with that.
