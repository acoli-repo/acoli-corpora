00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.768
And we built ourselves
an algorithm precisely for that.

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.351
So imagine that we have a person

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.643
and we know a person is making a choice

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:07.601
about a product or service,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.684
and from this person,
I can know their gender, of course,

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:13.934
other demographics, where they live,
their income, other things.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.143
I know the context where
this person is making a decision,

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.184
where they are, who they're with,

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.018
the energy, anything,

00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:23.101
and I can also put
other things in the mix.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.476
I can know their attitudes,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.143
how they feel about the category,

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:27.559
their behaviors.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:32.184
So if you imagine this kind of blob
of big data about a person --
