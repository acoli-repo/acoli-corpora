So, if you are, like me,
a person that is in business,

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:36.643
that I am constantly worried
about what is my role

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:39.726
in the broader societal discussions,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.726
if you're listening to your business
and you hear things like,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.893
"Oh, my target are women,
my target are men,

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.601
this goes to young girls, young boys,"

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.518
when it's that gender conversation,

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:51.059
unless you are working, again,

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:55.226
in a very specific,
gender-specific product category,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.726
take this as a warning sign,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.601
because if you keep
having these conversations,

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.143
you will keep perpetuating
stereotypes of people
