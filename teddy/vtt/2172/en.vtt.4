I'm not talking even about the backlash
on stereotypes in advertising,

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:05.101
which is a very real thing
that has to be addressed.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.434
I'm saying it's bad business because
you're leaving money on the table

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.226
for your brands and your products.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.351
Because gender is such an easy thing
to find in the market

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.268
and to target and to talk about,

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:17.601
it actually distracts you
from the fun things

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.851
that could be driving growth
from your brands

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.184
and, at the same time,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.851
it continues to create
separation around genders

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.643
and perpetuate stereotypes.

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.851
So at the same time
this activity is bad for your business

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.125
and bad for society, so double whammy.
