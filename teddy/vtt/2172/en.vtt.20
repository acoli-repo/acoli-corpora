00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.143
you will keep perpetuating
stereotypes of people

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.851
and making people think
that men and women are different.

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.684
But because this is business,
and we're running a business,

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.018
and we want to grow it,

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.851
at least kind of challenge
your own instinct to use gender,

00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:15.393
because statistics say that you're
probably not choosing the best variable

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:17.309
to target your product or service.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.559
Growth is not easy at all.

00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:21.934
What makes you think
that growth is going to come

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.351
from going into market
with such an outdated lens like gender?

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.059
So let's stop doing what's easy
and go for what's right.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:31.601
At this point, it's not just
for your business, it's for society.
