00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:10.871
Consider the following sentence:
“This statement is false.”

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:12.163
Is that true?

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.538
If so, that would make
this statement false.

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:16.829
But if it’s false, then the statement 
is true.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:22.121
By referring to itself directly, this 
statement creates an unresolvable paradox.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.788
So if it’s not true and it’s not false—
what is it?

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:29.163
This question might seem 
like a silly thought experiment.

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:33.829
But in the early 20th century,
it led Austrian logician Kurt Gödel
