00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:05.449
In the past several days, I heard people talking about China.

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.403
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:11.866
Something is very challenging to me.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.927
I want to make my friends understand:

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:18.495
China is complicated.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.590
So I always want to tell the story, like,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.046
one hand it is that, the other hand is that.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.832
You can't just tell a one sided story.

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:30.013
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.
