00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:33.759
I was confronting something
that was racially challenging.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.556
But certainly, there were undercurrents
and slights and things like that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.231
that I was attentive to
because she helped me to see.

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:44.360
I'm always amazed by both
young women and people of color

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:47.966
who are 25, 30 years old,
and they'll say things like,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.879
"I've never experienced any sexism,"
"I've never experienced any racism,"

00:06:51.903 --> 00:06:53.847
and I literally want to say to them,

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:56.593
"You just didn't see it. It was there."

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.617
And that's not me being a negative Nellie,

00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.283
it's just the truth
of the world that we live in.
