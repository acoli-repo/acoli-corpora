00:05:56.395 --> 00:06:00.118
but she taught me to be color-brave,
that's right, she did.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.863
Because she didn't make race
a conversation that was taboo,

00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:06.020
she put it right in front of me.

00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:09.098
And she sensitized me to all the issues

00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:13.656
that would come from being
first a black girl and then a black woman

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.569
in America and then the world.

00:06:15.593 --> 00:06:17.143
And as I look back on that now,

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:20.918
I have so much gratitude for her,
that was really a gift that she gave me,

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:24.856
because it really armed me,
it was like a superhero outfit

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.704
that I put on to get ready for the day,

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:29.951
and it wasn't because
every moment of every day

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:33.759
I was confronting something
that was racially challenging.
