00:09:27.638 --> 00:09:30.045
I felt like I had earned
the right to be there,

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.070
despite sometimes having people say things

00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:34.117
like I was an affirmative action baby,

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:37.037
and I've had people say
I took their kid's slot,

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:39.704
you know, those kind of things,
which are crazy.

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:42.244
But I would say
that every day that I was there,

00:09:42.268 --> 00:09:46.720
I had the sense that I was given
this real opportunity

00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:49.093
to learn and do something with it.

00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:51.474
And so I just took advantage of it.

00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:52.872
I really did, I loved it.

00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:55.441
I mean, I would go home early
from Christmas vacation

00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:58.331
to go back to Princeton,
which, who does that?

00:09:58.355 --> 00:09:59.524
I did.

00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:01.982
You know, I'd be
at a basically empty campus.
