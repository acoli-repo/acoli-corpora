and the problems that we have,
again, not only in this country,

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:37.831
but in this world around these issues,

00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:41.554
but distinctly around these issues
in America, given our history.

00:08:41.933 --> 00:08:45.610
CA: There's so much in what you just said,
and we're going to come back to it.

00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:47.651
But for now, I just want to go back to you

00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:50.634
as this black girl
in a mainly white school,

00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:52.806
who nonetheless shone,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.245
and shone partly, from what you just said,

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:59.730
just because of your focus,
your determination to not be poor.
