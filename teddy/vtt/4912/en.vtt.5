My oldest sister is more
than two decades older than me,

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.239
and I have one brother.

00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:34.696
Four sisters and a brother.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.783
They were very fond
of saying that I wasn't planned,

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.982
they used to make jokes all the time
about the fact that --

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.407
they used to say
that I was found on the doorstep.

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:46.984
When you have a sister
who is 25 years older than you,

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:49.617
and you're five years old,
you kind of believe them.

00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.347
And it was very funny, growing up,

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:55.077
I joke with people -- I didn't have
a chicken breast until I was an adult.

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.387
I thought "wing" was the chicken.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.870
(Laughter)

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.273
You know, when you're the youngest kid,
you kind of get the last of everything.
