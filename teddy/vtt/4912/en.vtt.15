00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.204
didn't we win those battles
two or three decades ago?

00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:33.106
Can't we just get on and talk
to each other as human beings?"

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.634
And you believe definitely that it's,

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.801
you know, maybe at some point
in the future that might be possible,

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:42.998
but for now, no, we can't do that.

00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:44.236
MH: We can't do that.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.910
And if anything, our present conversation,

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:50.537
which has devolved
from even my talk in 2014,

00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:54.950
is an indication of how desperately
this country needs to understand

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.165
what has happened.

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:58.927
I can't remember who told me this,
but someone said to me,

00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:01.109
America was born with a birth defect.
