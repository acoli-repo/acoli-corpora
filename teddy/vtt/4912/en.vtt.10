that were less than perfect,

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:09.331
I wouldn't be shocked and amazed
or thrown off my game.

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:11.522
That I would be prepared mentally

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:14.617
for the adversity.

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.641
And that, I'm grateful for.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:19.856

00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:26.575
but my mother was just practical
and she didn't allow us to have fantasies,

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.101
I mean she just didn't.
