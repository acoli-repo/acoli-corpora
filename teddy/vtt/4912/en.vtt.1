00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:30.090
about something that some of us
might find just a bit uncomfortable.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.424
It's a conversation about race.

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:34.209
I'm a white guy.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.923
And most of the white people I know
are progressive souls

00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:40.752
who recognize the centuries
of injustice in many parts of the world.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:42.228
They loathe racism.

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.903
They do not view themselves
as racist in any way.

00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:48.831
In fact, they crave a world
where these issues would go away.

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:53.396
Where we can just look at each other,
one person to another.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.696
That desire for a person's race
to become invisible,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.987
you can call that "color blindness."
