Chris Anderson:
Welcome to the TED Interview.

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:07.757
I'm Chris Anderson

00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:11.148
and this is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:14.004
and we get to dive much deeper
into their ideas

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.123
than was possible during their TED talk.

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.758
Today, my guest is Mellody Hobson,

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.165
a business leader and innovator,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.497
and we're going to attempt
to have a conversation

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:30.090
about something that some of us
might find just a bit uncomfortable.
