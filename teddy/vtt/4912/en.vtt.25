00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:32.623
who had this belief that you should
never sleep past six am on any day.

00:12:33.188 --> 00:12:34.839
And if you did, even on a weekend,

00:12:34.863 --> 00:12:37.550
she would say, "The world
is passing you by."

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:41.065
And she'd want you to look out the window
and see how many lights were on

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:42.724
and give you a sense of you know,

00:12:42.748 --> 00:12:45.542
how many people were getting ahead
while you were sleeping.

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:48.104
And to this day, I still have
that same sensitivity,

00:12:48.128 --> 00:12:51.390
I live in a high-rise in Chicago
and I check the lights

00:12:51.414 --> 00:12:54.484
to see how many lights are on
when I'm waking up,

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:57.309
to see, you know,
are other people getting an edge.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.587
Could I be waking up earlier
and doing more.
