00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.273
You know, when you're the youngest kid,
you kind of get the last of everything.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:05.958
But it was a great family and a great life

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:08.278
and even though
I was the baby of the family,

00:03:08.302 --> 00:03:10.644
I was very independent
and self-sufficient.

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:12.903
I was born focused.

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:15.029
I mean, I really was,
I was one of those kids

00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:19.331
who came out of the womb
very much with the sense of direction

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:21.577
and very much of a sense
of what I wanted to be

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.982
and a lot of it was based upon the fact
that I didn't want to be poor,

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.879
that we lived this life
that was very up and down,

00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:31.651
and sometimes we had an OK existence,
and sometimes we didn't.
