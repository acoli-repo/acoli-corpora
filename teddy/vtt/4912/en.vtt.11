CA: Right there in your childhood,

00:05:30.347 --> 00:05:33.529
you were almost being nudged away
from being color-blind,

00:05:33.553 --> 00:05:35.664
your mother was specifically saying --

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:38.085
you know, she might have
ignored race, if you like,

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.250
but she was making you
pay attention to it.

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.289
Would you encourage
other mothers to do that?

00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:47.601
The issue matters too much
to any child not to do that.

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.046
MH: It's fascinating you say that,
because I never thought of it that way,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.371
and I'm actually a bit overtaken
with emotion, with the thought,

00:05:56.395 --> 00:06:00.118
but she taught me to be color-brave,
that's right, she did.
