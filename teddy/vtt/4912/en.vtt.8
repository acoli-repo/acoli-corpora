CA: Any specific stories of you as a kid

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.561
that might have fueled your sense
around the issue of race,

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.124
racial injustice of some kind,

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:09.720
was that an issue you were
deeply aware of, growing up?

00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:12.847
MH: I was deeply aware of it
because my mother made me aware of it

00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:14.196
at a very young age.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.454
I grew up going to a school
where there weren't a lot of black kids.

00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:22.802
And so my mother, from a very, very
young age, has sensitized me to race.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:24.453
Rightly or wrongly, she just did.

00:04:24.477 --> 00:04:26.038
And she made it very clear to me

00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:29.077
that I wouldn't always be in situations
where I would be welcome

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.903
or where people would treat me well.
