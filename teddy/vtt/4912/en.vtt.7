00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:31.651
and sometimes we had an OK existence,
and sometimes we didn't.

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:35.598
And we used to get evicted
and our car used to get repossessed,

00:03:35.622 --> 00:03:37.451
and our phone used to get disconnected

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:39.141
and we were literally that family

00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:42.217
that had the bounced check
on the wall at the store.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.101
And because of that,
I was desperate to understand money

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.426
which why it's not an accident
I'm in the financial services industry.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.657
And it's probably not an accident

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:56.450
that I had this search
for truth and justice,

00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:59.417
because of some of the inequality
that I saw and lived.
