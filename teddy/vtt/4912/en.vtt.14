00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.283
it's just the truth
of the world that we live in.

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:04.728
And my mother did not let me
walk around with those --

00:07:04.752 --> 00:07:07.166
and I'll bring the pun
all the way forward --

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.608
blinders on.

00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:11.347
CA: Well, this is such
an important conversation,

00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:14.859
because I think there's definitely
plenty of people out there in the world

00:07:14.883 --> 00:07:18.495
who really want the comfort
of color-blind, if you like.

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:22.250
They don't believe themselves
to be racist in any way,

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:24.896
but they are uncomfortable
with the conversation.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.926
It's like, "Couldn't that
all just go away,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.204
didn't we win those battles
two or three decades ago?
