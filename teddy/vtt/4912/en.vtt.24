00:11:58.474 --> 00:12:00.919
I'd always worked really,
really hard as a student,

00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:03.196
I mean hard, just crazy.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.799
Used to lock myself
in the bathroom in my house,

00:12:05.823 --> 00:12:08.347
because there were
no quiet rooms to work in.

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:12.617
And when I went to Princeton,

00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.276
because it was just
a difficult school, you had to,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.037
you get 1,000 pages of reading in a week.

00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:21.299
And you were always drinking
from a fire hydrant.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:23.386
So I was predisposed to the work.

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:27.006
And so when I got to Ariel,
working hard was just normal for me.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.768
I also grew up with a mother

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:32.623
who had this belief that you should
never sleep past six am on any day.
