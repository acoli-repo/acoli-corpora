00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.987
you can call that "color blindness."

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:05.260
Color blindness might seem
to be built on good intentions,

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:08.878
but Mellody argues
that color blindness is dangerous.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.379
Mellody Hobson (TED 2014):
I think it's time for us to be comfortable

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:14.920
with the uncomfortable
conversation about race.

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:19.022
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic,
male, female, all of us.

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:24.029
If we truly believe in equal rights,
in equal opportunity in America,

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:28.133
I think we have to have
real conversations about this issue.

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:33.229
We cannot afford to be color-blind,
we have to be color-brave.
