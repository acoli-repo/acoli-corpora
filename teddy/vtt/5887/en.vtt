It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR,
I'm a new samadhi.

00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:10.954
And I want to go back to the early 90s,
to Poughkeepsie, New York, you know,

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.871
when I was growing up there
every Saturday,

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.538
basically my father would get up really
early and tinker and work on

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:18.663
the house that we lived in.

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:23.538
This is Michael Murphy, and that
house was an old Victorian.

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:27.413
It was designed by this incredible
architect named Horace Trumbo.

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:31.663
You know, the kind with shingles
and stained glass windows,
