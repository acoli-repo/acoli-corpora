00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to do things again, not just represent things.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
at the groundbreaking of the largest project

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I, and my firm, have ever been involved in.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I thought it represented the importance of the architect.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I stayed thrilled until I got home,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
threw the helmet onto my bed,
