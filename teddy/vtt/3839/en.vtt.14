I have lived here in the Zaatari camp
in Jordan for the last year and a half.

00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.931
I have a big family:


00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.697
three brothers, one is a baby.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:15.142
He cries a lot.

00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:20.197
I asked my father if I cried when 
I was a baby and he says I did not.

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:23.821
I think I was a stronger baby
than my brother.

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:26.731
CM: So, when you're inside 
of the headset.

00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:28.351
you're not seeing it like this.

00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:30.423
You're looking around through this world.
