Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.587
I rode this motorcycle everywhere.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.847
And I was there with Evel Knievel; we 
jumped the Snake River Canyon together.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:40.216
I wanted the rocket.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.996
I never got the rocket,
I only got the motorcycle.

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.203
I felt so connected to this world.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:52.440
I didn't want to be a storyteller 
when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.644
I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.027
I had so much empathy for him.

00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:01.358
But it didn't work out. (Laughter)
