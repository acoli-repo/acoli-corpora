00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:01.874
and what I was trying to do was
to build the ultimate empathy machine.

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:05.588
And here's one of the early experiments:

00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:08.412
(Music)

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:10.656
So this is called
"The Wilderness Downtown."

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.712
It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.362
It asked you to put in the address
where you grew up at the beginning of it.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.359
It's a website.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.275
And out of it starts growing these little
boxes with different browser windows.

00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:24.657
And you see this teenager 
running down a street,

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:27.415
and then you see Google Street View
and Google Maps imagery

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.939
and you realize the street
he's running down is yours.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.048
And when he stops in front of a house,
he stops in front of your house.
