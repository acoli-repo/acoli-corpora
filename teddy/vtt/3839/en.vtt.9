00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.848
So now I've got you inside of the frame,

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:39.403
and I saw people having even more
visceral emotional reactions

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.080
to this work than the previous one.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.230
But then I started thinking about frames,
and what do they represent?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.487
And a frame is just a window.

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.566
I mean, all the media that we watch --
television, cinema --

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:53.819
they're these windows into 
these other worlds.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.507
And I thought, well, great. 
I got you in a frame.

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.634
But I don't want you in the frame,
I don't want you in the window,

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.523
I want you through the window,
I want you on the other side,
