It's a group of rectangles that are
played in a sequence.

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.362
And we've done incredible things
with those rectangles.

00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:39.247
But I started thinking about,

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:43.616
is there a way that I can use modern
and developing technologies

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:45.741
to tell stories in different ways

00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.482
and tell different kinds of stories

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:51.793
that maybe I couldn't tell using
the traditional tools of filmmaking

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.964
that we've been using for 100 years?

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.785
So I started experimenting,

00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:01.874
and what I was trying to do was
to build the ultimate empathy machine.
