00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:05.950
Virtual reality started for me
in sort of an unusual place.

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.173
It was the 1970s.

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:12.383
I got into the field very young:
I was seven years old.

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:17.245
And the tool that I used 
to access virtual reality

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.810
was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.201
This is a commercial for 
that particular item:

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.776
(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.767
Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.536
That gyro-power sends him 
over 100 feet at top speed.

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:31.628
Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.
