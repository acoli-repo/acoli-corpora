And when he stops in front of a house,

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:39.417

having an even deeper emotional reaction

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:42.631
to this than the things that 
I had made in rectangles.

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.562
And I'm essentially taking 
a piece of your history

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:49.981
and putting it inside 
the framing of the story.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:51.578
But then I started thinking,

00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:53.430
okay, well that's a part of you,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.731
but how do I put all of you
inside of the frame?

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:01.834
So to do that, I started
making art installations.
