It connects humans to other humans
in a profound way

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:34.873
that I've never seen before 
in any other form of media.

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:38.612
And it can change people's
perception of each other.

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:40.298
And that's how I think

00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:43.734
virtual reality has the potential
to actually change the world.

00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:49.151
So, it's a machine,

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:54.074
but through this machine
we become more compassionate,

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:59.667
we become more empathetic,
and we become more connected.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:03.521
And ultimately, we become more human.
