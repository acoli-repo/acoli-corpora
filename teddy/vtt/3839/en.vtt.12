00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:00.210
This is a camera system that we built

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.235
that has 3D cameras that look
in every direction

00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:05.987
and binaural microphones
that face in every direction.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:11.333
We take this and we build, basically,
a sphere of a world that you inhabit.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.736
So what I'm going to show you
is not a view into the world,

00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:18.107
it's basically the whole world
stretched into a rectangle.

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:21.495
So this film is called 
"Clouds Over Sidra,"

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:25.989
and it was made in conjunction with 
our virtual reality company called VRSE

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:27.755
and the United Nations,

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:30.788
and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.
