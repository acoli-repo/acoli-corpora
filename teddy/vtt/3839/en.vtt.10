00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.523
I want you through the window,
I want you on the other side,

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:05.598
in the world, inhabiting the world.

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.123
So that leads me back to virtual reality.

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:11.344
Let's talk about virtual reality.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:13.934
Unfortunately,


00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:18.423
talking about virtual reality
is like dancing about architecture.

00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:25.340
And this is actually someone dancing
about architecture in virtual reality.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.823
(Laughter)

00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:31.084
So, it's difficult to explain.
Why is it difficult to explain?
