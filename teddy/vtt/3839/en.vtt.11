00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:31.084
So, it's difficult to explain.
Why is it difficult to explain?

00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:34.782
It's difficult because it's a very 
experiential medium.

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:36.698
You feel your way inside of it.

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:38.496
It's a machine, but inside of it,

00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:41.945
it feels like real life,
it feels like truth.

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.466
And you feel present in the world
that you're inside

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.689
and you feel present with the people
that you're inside of it with.


00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.785
So, I'm going to show you a demo
of a virtual reality film:

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.006
a full-screen version of
all the information

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:56.209
that we capture when
we shoot virtual reality.

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:58.034
So we're shooting in every direction.

00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:00.210
This is a camera system that we built
