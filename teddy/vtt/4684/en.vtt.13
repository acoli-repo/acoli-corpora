00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.593
these are all deeply existential threats

00:06:30.617 --> 00:06:33.665
that we have failed to address
with our current ways of thinking.

00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:38.580
Successful paths forward
will require us to develop new tools.

00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:43.014
So how do we incorporate
commons-based logic

00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:46.399
into our global and space institutions?

00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:51.862
Well, here's one attempt
that came from an unlikely source.

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.810
As a young activist in World War II,

00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:58.134
Arvid Pardo was arrested
for anti-fascist organizing

00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:01.340
and held under death sentence
by the Gestapo.
