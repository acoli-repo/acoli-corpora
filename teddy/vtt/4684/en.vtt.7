00:03:29.858 --> 00:03:31.553
some of us were so inspired

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:34.416
that we actually decided
to keep living together.

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:39.130
Now, living with 20 people
might sound kind of crazy,

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:44.665
but over the years, it enabled us
to create a high-trust group

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.228
that allowed us to experiment
with these social technologies.

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:53.273
We designed governance systems
ranging from assigning a CEO

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:55.409
to using a jury process.

00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.420
And as we grew into our careers,

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:01.883
and we moved from DC think tanks
to working for NASA
