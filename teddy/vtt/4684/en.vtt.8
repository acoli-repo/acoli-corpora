to starting our own companies,

00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:06.952
these experiments enabled us to see

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.980
how even small groups
could be a petri dish

00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:13.732
for important societal questions
such as representation,

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:16.016
sustainability or opportunity.

00:04:16.993 --> 00:04:20.741
People often talk about the Moon
as a petri dish

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.610
or even a blank slate.

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:27.797
But because of the legal agreements
that govern the Moon,

00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:30.989
it actually has something
very important in common
