00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.354
That's greater than the size of Lake Erie,

00:01:01.378 --> 00:01:05.351
and enough water to support
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.505
living and working on the Moon.

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:11.099
So although official plans
are always evolving,

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:13.738
there's real reason to think
that we could see people

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.555
starting to live and work on the Moon

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.789
in the next decade.

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:22.148
However, the Moon is roughly
the size of the continent of Africa,

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:24.934
and we're starting to see
that the key resources

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.232
may be concentrated in small areas

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.562
near the poles.

00:01:29.053 --> 00:01:34.062
This raises important questions about
coordinating access to scarce resources.
