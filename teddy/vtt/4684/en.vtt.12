00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.551
important aspects
of our survival and well-being,

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:02.970
like climate or the oceans.

00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:07.748
Commons-based approaches offer
a greenfield for institution design

00:06:07.772 --> 00:06:09.581
that's only beginning to be explored

00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:12.741
at the global and interplanetary level.

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.445
What do property rights look like?

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.208
And how do we manage resources

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:20.668
when the traditional tools
of external authority and private property

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:21.902
don't apply?

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:24.687
Though we don't have all the answers,

00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.822
climate, internet governance,
authoritarianism --

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.593
these are all deeply existential threats
