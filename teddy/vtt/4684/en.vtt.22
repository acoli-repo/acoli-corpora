00:10:56.705 --> 00:11:00.900
can we prototype
new institutions at global scale

00:11:00.924 --> 00:11:04.903
in a self-contained environment
with the exact design constraints needed

00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:07.721
for our biggest challenges here on Earth?

00:11:09.197 --> 00:11:11.042
Back in 1999,

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:14.546
the United Nations taught
a group of young space geeks

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.731
that we could think bigger,

00:11:16.755 --> 00:11:19.899
that we could impact nations
if we chose to.

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:24.340
Today, the stage is set for the next step:

00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:28.340
to envision what comes after
territory and borders.

00:11:29.227 --> 00:11:30.379
Thank you.
