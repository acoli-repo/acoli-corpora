00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:30.989
it actually has something
very important in common

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:33.608
with our global challenges here on Earth.

00:04:34.343 --> 00:04:40.538
They both involve issues that require us
to think beyond territory and borders,

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:43.166
meaning the Moon is actually
more of a template

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.778
than a blank slate.

00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:51.288
Signed in 1967, the Outer Space Treaty
is the defining treaty

00:04:51.312 --> 00:04:53.466
governing activities in outer space,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.829
including the Moon.

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:57.804
And it has two key ingredients

00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:02.357
that radically alter the basis
on which laws can be constructed.
