00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.821
If there are no rules on the Moon,

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:35.737
then won't we end up
in a first-come, first-served situation?

00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:38.464
And we might,

00:10:38.488 --> 00:10:40.700
if we dismiss this moment.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.732
But not if we're willing to be bold
and to engage the challenge.

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:49.538
As we learned in our communities
of self-governance,

00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:54.099
it's easier to create something new
than trying to dismantle the old.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.681
And where else but the Moon

00:10:56.705 --> 00:11:00.900
can we prototype
new institutions at global scale
