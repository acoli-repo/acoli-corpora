00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.165
the idea of the Moon as just a destination

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.997
embodies these problematic qualities.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.119
It conjures a frontier attitude

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:09.537
of conquest,

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.913
big rockets and expensive projects,

00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:13.812
competition and winning.

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.305
But what's most interesting about the Moon

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.870
isn't the billionaires with their rockets

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:22.927
or the same old
power struggle between states.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.140
In fact, it's not the hardware at all.

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:28.700
It's the software.

00:02:28.724 --> 00:02:31.244
It's the norms, customs and laws.
