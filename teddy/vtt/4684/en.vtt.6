I've spent the last two decades
working on international space policy,

00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:05.608
but also on small community projects
with bottom-up governance design.

00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:07.870
When I was 17,

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:11.206
I went to a UN conference
on the peaceful uses of outer space

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.403
in Vienna.

00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:17.429
Over two weeks, 160 young people
from over 60 countries

00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:20.861
were crammed into a big hotel
next to the UN building.

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.412
We were invited to make recommendations

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.603
to Member States

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:27.565
about the role of space
in humanity's future.

00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:29.834
After the conference,

00:03:29.858 --> 00:03:31.553
some of us were so inspired
