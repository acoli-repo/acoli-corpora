WEBVTT

00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:31.588
is built on the idea of state sovereignty,

00:05:31.612 --> 00:05:34.919
on the appropriation of land
and resources within borders

00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:38.744
and the autonomy to control free access
within those borders.

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:41.839
By doing away with both of these,

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:45.132
we create the conditions
for what are called the "commons."

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.912
Based on the work of Nobel
Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom,

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:53.743
global commons are those resources
that we all share

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.645
that require us to work together
to manage and protect

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.551
important aspects
of our survival and well-being,
