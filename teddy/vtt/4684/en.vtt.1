in unprecedented ways.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.244
There are over a hundred
launch companies around the world

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.919
and roughly a dozen private
lunar transportation companies

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:41.905
readying robotic missions
to the lunar surface.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:46.619
We have reusable rockets
for the first time in human history.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:49.716
This will enable the development
of infrastructure

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.707
and utilization of resources.

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:54.767
While estimates vary, scientists think

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.354
That's greater than the size of Lake Erie,
