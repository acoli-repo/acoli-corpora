00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:30.316
and what consent looks like.

00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:33.751
And these are questions
of social technology,

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:35.789
not rockets and hardware.

00:09:36.703 --> 00:09:40.818
In fact, these conversations
are starting to happen right now.

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:44.589
The space community is discussing
basic shared agreements,

00:09:44.613 --> 00:09:49.264
such as how do we designate
lunar areas as heritage sites,

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:52.184
and how do we get permission
for where to land

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:54.456
when traditional external authority

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.098
doesn't apply?

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:59.096
How do we enforce requirements
for coordination

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.197
when it's against the rules
to tell people where to go?
