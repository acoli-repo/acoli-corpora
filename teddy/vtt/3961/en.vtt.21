were starting out as young adults

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.136

and high achievement

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.096
were what they needed to go after
to have a good life.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.296

our study has shown

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.976
that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships,
