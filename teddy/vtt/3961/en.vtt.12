00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.816
The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this:

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.040
Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.816
We've learned three big lessons
about relationships.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.936
The first is that social connections
are really good for us,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.456
and that loneliness kills.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.136
It turns out that people
who are more socially connected

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.256
to family, to friends, to community,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.976
are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer
