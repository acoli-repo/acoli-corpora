00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.536
"There isn't time, so brief is life,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.720
for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.536
There is only time for loving,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.280

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.136
The good life is built
with good relationships.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.376
Thank you.
