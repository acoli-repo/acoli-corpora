00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.056
have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.160
telling you that
the study still continues.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.896
Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.976
calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.120
yet one more set of questions
about their lives.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.616
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.520
"Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.976
The Harvard men never ask that question.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.200
