00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.256
And the sad fact
is that at any given time,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.880
more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.696
And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.376
and you can be lonely in a marriage,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.536
so the second big lesson that we learned

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.656
is that it's not just
the number of friends you have,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.176
and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.840
but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.336
It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health.
