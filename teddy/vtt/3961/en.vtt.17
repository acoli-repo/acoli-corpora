Our most happily partnered men and women

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.535
reported, in their 80s,

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.496

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.480
their mood stayed just as happy.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.656
But the people who were
in unhappy relationships,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.616
on the days when they
reported more physical pain,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.680
it was magnified by more emotional pain.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.736

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.016
is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies,
