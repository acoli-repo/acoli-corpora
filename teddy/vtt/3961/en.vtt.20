this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.880
Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.016

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.856
What we'd really like is a quick fix,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.576
something we can get

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.360
that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.656

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.536
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
