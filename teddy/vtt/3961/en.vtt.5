00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.536
But through a combination of luck

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.256
and the persistence
of several generations of researchers,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.840
this study has survived.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.016
About 60 of our original 724 men

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.336
are still alive,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.536
still participating in the study,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.600
most of them in their 90s.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.456
And we are now beginning to study

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840
the more than 2,000 children of these men.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
