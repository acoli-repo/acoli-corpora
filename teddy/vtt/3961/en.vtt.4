00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.856
year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.256
and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.720
were going to turn out.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.896
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.976
Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.176
because too many people
drop out of the study,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.096
or funding for the research dries up,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.376
or the researchers get distracted,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.
