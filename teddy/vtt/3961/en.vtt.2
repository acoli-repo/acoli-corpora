00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.936
of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.840
those pictures
are almost impossible to get.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.136
Most of what we know about human life

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.616
we know from asking people
to remember the past,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.416
and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.136
We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.040
and sometimes memory
is downright creative.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.176
But what if we could watch entire lives

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.056
as they unfold through time?
