in the less developed market.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So for the past few years, the coastal areas,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
they found themselves in a shortage of labor.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
These diagrams show

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The first one is the Engels coefficient,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
which explains that the cost of daily necessities

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
all through the past decade,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But then in the last two years,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
it goes up again to 39 percent,
