00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
送你葱

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that ordinary stuff.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It means "green onion for free."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Why did she say that?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Because it was a line

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a 50-some year-old woman,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
who loves singing Western opera,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but she didn't understand

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
any English or French or Italian,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so she managed to fill in the lyrics

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with vegetable names in Chinese.
