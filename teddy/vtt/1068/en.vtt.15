00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is sometimes very strong, active

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and even violent.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So through microblogging,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So how are they different?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
First of all, most of them were born

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in the 80s and 90s,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
under the one-child policy.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And because of selected abortion

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
by families who favored boys to girls,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
now we have ended up

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
with 30 million more young men than women.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That could pose

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a potential danger to the society,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but who knows;
