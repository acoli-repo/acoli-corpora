00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it's not me --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it's a movie star,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
under 30 years old.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And because, as you know,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
social media offers an opening

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to let the steam out a little bit.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But because you don't have many other openings,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the heat coming out of this opening

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is sometimes very strong, active

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and even violent.
