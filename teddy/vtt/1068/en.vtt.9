00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And sometimes I have young people approaching me

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
say, "Lan, you changed my life,"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and I feel proud of that.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But then we are also so fortunate

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to witness the transformation of the whole country.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I was representing the Shanghai Expo.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I saw China embracing the world

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and vice versa.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
But then sometimes I'm thinking,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
what are today's young generation up to?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
How are they different,
