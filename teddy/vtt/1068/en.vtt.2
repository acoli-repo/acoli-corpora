WEBVTT

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so she managed to fill in the lyrics

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with vegetable names in Chinese.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that she was singing in the stadium

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was "green onion for free."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
80,000 live audience sang together.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That was hilarious.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I guess both Susan Boyle

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
belonged to otherness.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They were the least expected to be successful
