00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the first ever open audition

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by national television in China --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with another thousand college girls.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The producer told us

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
they were looking for some sweet, innocent

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and beautiful fresh face.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"Why [do] women's personalities on television

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and, you know, supportive?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Why can't they have their own ideas

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and their own voice?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I thought I kind of offended them.
