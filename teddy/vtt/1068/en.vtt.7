and their own voice?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I thought I kind of offended them.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But actually, they were impressed by my words.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And so I was in the second round of competition,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then the third and the fourth.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
After seven rounds of competition,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I was the last one to survive it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So I was on a national television prime-time show.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And believe it or not,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that was the first show on Chinese television

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that allowed its hosts

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to speak out of their own minds

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
without reading an approved script.
