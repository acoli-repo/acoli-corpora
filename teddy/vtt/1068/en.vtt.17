00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and about to be 15 percent

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
by the year of 2030.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And you know we have the tradition

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that younger generations support the elders financially,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and taking care of them when they're sick.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So it means young couples

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
will have to support four parents

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So making a living is not that easy

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
for young people.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
College graduates are not in short supply.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In urban areas,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
college graduates find the starting salary

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,
