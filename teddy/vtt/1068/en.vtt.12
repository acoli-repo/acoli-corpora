WEBVTT

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we know that she herself made up that title --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
All those expensive items

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
were given to her as gifts

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
by her boyfriend,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
who used to be a board member

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It's very complicated to explain.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It is still boiling.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It shows us a general mistrust

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of government or government-backed institutions,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
which lacked transparency in the past.
