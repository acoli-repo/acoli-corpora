WEBVTT

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
while the average rent

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
is above $500.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So what do they do? They have to share space --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
squeezed in very limited space

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to save money --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and they call themselves "tribe of ants."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And for those who are ready to get married

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and buy their apartment,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
they figured out they have to work

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for 30 to 40 years

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to afford their first apartment.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
That ratio in America

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
would only cost a couple five years to earn,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but in China it's 30 to 40 years
