00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000

I summoned my courage and poise and said,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in a five-star hotel.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Around the same time,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was going through an audition --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the first ever open audition
