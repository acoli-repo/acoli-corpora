The night before I was heading for Scotland,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was invited to host the final

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Guess who was the performing guest?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Susan Boyle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She sang beautifully,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
