00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to job losses,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
subject to inflation,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
tightening loans from banks,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
appreciation of the renminbi,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
or decline of demand

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
from Europe or America

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
for the products they produce.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Last year, though,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
an appalling incident

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
13 young workers

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in their late teens and early 20s

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
committed suicide,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
just one by one like causing a contagious disease.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But they died because of all different personal reasons.
