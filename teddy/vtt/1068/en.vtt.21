00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
just one by one like causing a contagious disease.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But they died because of all different personal reasons.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But this whole incident

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
aroused a huge outcry from society

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
about the isolation,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
both physical and mental,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of these migrant workers.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
For those who do return back to the countryside,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
they find themselves very welcome locally,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
because with the knowledge, skills and networks

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they have learned in the cities,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
with the assistance of the Internet,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
they're able to create more jobs,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
upgrade local agriculture and create new business

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in the less developed market.
