00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
without reading an approved script.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And my weekly audience at that time

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Well after a few years,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to pursue my postgraduate studies,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and then started my own media company,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And sometimes I have young people approaching me
