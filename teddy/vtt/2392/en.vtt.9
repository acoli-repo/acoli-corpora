00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.803
we've actually been building instruments

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.699
in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.900
based right here at Stanford Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.683
Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:42.312
humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:43.909
Now the reason we have these

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.379
is so that for the instruments that we create

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.603
out of the laptop, we want the sound to come

00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:51.123
out of somewhere near the instrument

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:52.491
and the performer,

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.193
kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:57.079
Like, if I were to play a violin here,

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.190
the sound would naturally not come out of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.964
the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.
