00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:00.143
This thing I have in front of me

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:03.355
actually used to be a commodity gaming controller

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:05.145
called a Gametrak.

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:07.021
This thing actually has a glove
you can put on your hands.

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:08.581
It's tethered to the base,

00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:11.110
and this will track the position of your hands

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.163
in real time.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.537
It was originally designed as a golfing controller

00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:17.453
to detect the motion of your swing.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:19.984
That turned out to be a rather large

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:21.688
commercial non-success,

00:06:21.688 --> 00:06:25.442
at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,

00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:27.450
at which point computer music researchers

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.508
said, "This is awesome!

00:06:29.508 --> 00:06:32.257
We can prototype instruments out of this."
