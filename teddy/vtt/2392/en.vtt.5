00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.187
Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:31.931
and then just change some of these numbers,

00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.891
220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.331
and .5 and 880.

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.693
By doubling the frequency,

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.210
we're actually going up in successive octaves,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.547
and then we have this sequence --

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:45.674
(Tones) — of tones.

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:47.580
Okay, great, now I can imagine creating

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.022
all kinds of really horrible

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:51.420
single sine wave pieces of music with this,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.332
but I'm going to do something
that computers are really good at,

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:56.156
which is repetition.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:57.860
I'm going to put this all in a while loop,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.156
and you actually don't need to indent,

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.280
but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.
