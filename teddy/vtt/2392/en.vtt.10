00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.964
the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:05.171
So these speakers are meant to emulate that.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.500
In fact, I'm going to show you

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.243
how we actually built them.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.307
The first step is to go to IKEA

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:12.687
and buy a salad bowl.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.917
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.

to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.236
And the first step is you turn it upside down,

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.711
and then you drill holes in them,

00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.220
six holes per hemi,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.934
and then make a base plate,
