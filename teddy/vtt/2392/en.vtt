00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:03.108
I want to talk to you about one thing

00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:04.864
and just one thing only,

00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:08.620
and this has to do with when people ask me,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.867
what do you do?

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.767
To which I usually respond,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.907
I do computer music.

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:18.852
Now, a number of people

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.089
just stop talking to me right then and there,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.502
and the rest who are left usually have

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.750
this blank look in their eye,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.919
as if to say, what does that mean?

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.137
And I feel like I'm actually depriving them
