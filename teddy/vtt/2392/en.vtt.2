00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:01.283
And I think we'll begin with just this question:

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:02.620
What is computer music?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.400
And I'm going to try to do my
best to provide a definition,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.131
maybe by telling you a story

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.778
that goes through some of the stuff

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.704
I've been working on.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.516
And the first thing, I think, in our story

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:16.064
is going to be something called ChucK.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:21.437
Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:24.146
and it's open-source, it's freely available,

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.066
and I like to think that it crashes equally well

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.410
on all modern operating systems.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.370
And instead of telling you more about it,
