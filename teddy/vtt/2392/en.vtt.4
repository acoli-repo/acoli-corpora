00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:00.937
And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:02.091
Now this is kind of the abstraction

00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.699
for the sound output on my computer. Okay?

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:07.899
So I've connected myself into the speaker.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.491
Next, I'm going to say my frequency

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.459
is 440 hertz,

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.278
and I'm going to let time advance

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:18.000
by two seconds through this operation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.068
All right, so if I were to play this --

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:24.740
(Tone) —

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.161
you would hear a sine wave
at 440 hertz for two seconds.

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.187
Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,
