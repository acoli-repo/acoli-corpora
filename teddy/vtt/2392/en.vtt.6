00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.280
but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.884
It's good practice.

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.464
And when we do this —

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:08.961
(Tones) —

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.134
that's going to go on for a while.

00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:11.628
In fact, it's probably not going to stop

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:13.411
until this computer disintegrates.

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.110
And I can't really empirically prove that to you,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.779
but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.655
Next, I'm going to replace this 220

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.461
by math.random2f.

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:25.739
I'm going to generate a random number

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.879
between 30 and 1,000 and send that

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.965
to the frequency of me.
