00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.965
to the frequency of me.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.065
And I'm going to do this every half a second.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.007
(Tones)

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.668
Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:43.290
(Tones)

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.745
One hundred.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.357
(Tones)

00:03:46.357 --> 00:03:47.591
All right.

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.535
At this point, we've reached something

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:50.605
that I would like to think of as

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.626
the canonical computer music.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.443
This is, to me, the sound that mainframes

00:03:58.443 --> 00:03:59.565
are supposed to be making

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:02.807
when they're thinking really hard.
