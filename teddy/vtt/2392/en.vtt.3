00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.370
And instead of telling you more about it,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.196
I'm just going to give you a demo.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.352
By the way, I'm just going to nerd out

00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:35.981
for just a few minutes here,

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.779
so I would say, don't freak out.

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.850
In fact, I would invite all of you to join me

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.034
in just geeking out.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:45.096
If you've never written a line
of code before in your life,

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:46.282
do not worry.

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:49.799
I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.218
First thing I'm going to do is to make

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:53.051
a sine wave oscillator,

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.085
and we're going to called the sine wave generator

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.847
"Ge."

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:00.937
And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.
