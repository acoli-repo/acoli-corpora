00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.934
and then make a base plate,

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:33.614
put car speaker drivers in them

00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:36.205
along with amplifiers in the enclosure,

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.559
and you put that all together and you have

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.333
these hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:40.896
Add people, add laptops,

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:43.584
you have a laptop orchestra.

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:47.114
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.033
Well, let me give you a demonstration

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:52.268
of about 200 instruments we've created so far

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.511
for the Laptop Orchestra.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.938
And what I'm going to do is
actually come over to this thing.

00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:00.143
This thing I have in front of me
