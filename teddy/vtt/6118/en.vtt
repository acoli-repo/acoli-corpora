The story starts:
I was at a friend's house,

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.380
and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.616
which is the manual of mental disorders.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.910
It lists every known mental disorder.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.967
And it used to be, back in the '50s,
a very slim pamphlet.

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:19.616
And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.722
and now it's 886 pages long.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.090
And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.

00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:28.832
So I was leafing through it,

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:31.773
wondering if I had any mental disorders,
