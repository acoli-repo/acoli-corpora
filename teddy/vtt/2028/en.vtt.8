00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and interstate war.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And you can think back to 1941

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when the government of Japan

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's worth noticing

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that a non-state actor

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
attacking the United States in 2001

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
killed more Americans

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
than the government of Japan did in 1941.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You might think of that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
as the privatization of war.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So we're seeing a great change

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in terms of diffusion of power.
