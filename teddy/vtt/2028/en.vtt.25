00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of managing this power transition

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
of the shift toward the East is fear.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
from a different context,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We don't have to fear the rise of China

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
or the return of Asia.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And if we have policies

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in which we take it

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
in that larger historical perspective,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we're going to be able

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to manage this process.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Let me say a word now

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
about the distribution of power

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and how it relates to power diffusion
