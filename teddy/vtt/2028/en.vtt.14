00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you'll see the cycles of belief

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in American decline

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In 1958,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
after the Soviets put up Sputnik,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it was "That's the end of America."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
In 1973, with the oil embargo

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and the closing of the gold window,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that was the end of America.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In the 1980s,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
between the rust belt economy of the midwest

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to the Silicon Valley economy of California,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that was the end of America.
