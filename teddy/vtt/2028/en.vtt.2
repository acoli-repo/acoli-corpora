00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It really should be called

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the recovery or return of Asia.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we looked at the world

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in 1800,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you'd find that more than half of the world's people

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and they made more than half the world's product.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now fast forward to 1900:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but they're now making

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
only a fifth of the world's product.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What happened? The Industrial Revolution,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which meant that all of a sudden,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Europe and America
