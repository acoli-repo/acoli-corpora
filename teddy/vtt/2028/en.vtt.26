00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
about the distribution of power

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and how it relates to power diffusion

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and then pull these two types together.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
it's distributed much like

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a three-dimensional chess game.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Top board:

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
military power among states.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The United States is the only superpower,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and it's likely to remain that way

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
for two or three decades.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
