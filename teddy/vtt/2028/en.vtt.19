00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
until somewhere in the latter part,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
after 2050, of this century.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The other point that's worth noticing

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is how one-dimensional

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
this projection is.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You know, it looks at economic power

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
measured by GDP.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Doesn't tell you much about military power,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
doesn't tell you very much about soft power.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's all very one-dimensional.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
or return of Asia

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
as I called it a little bit earlier,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.
