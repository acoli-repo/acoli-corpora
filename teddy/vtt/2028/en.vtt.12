00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it's also whose story wins.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and whose narrative is going to be effective.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now let me go back

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to the question

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of power transition

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
between states

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and what's happening there.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the narratives that we use now

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
tend to be the rise and fall

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of the great powers.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the current narrative is all about

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the rise of China

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and the decline of the United States.
