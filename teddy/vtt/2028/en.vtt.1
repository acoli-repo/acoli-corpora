00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the way power is moving

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from all states West or East

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to non-state actors.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Those two things

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are the huge shifts of power

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in our century.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I want to tell you about them each separately

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then how they interact

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and why, in the end, there may be some good news.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When we talk about power transition,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we often talk about the rise of Asia.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It really should be called

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the recovery or return of Asia.
