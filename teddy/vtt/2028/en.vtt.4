00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
put this in your mind:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
computing and communications costs

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
have fallen a thousandfold

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
between 1970

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the beginning of this century.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now that's a big abstract number.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But to make it more real,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
if the price of an automobile

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
had fallen as rapidly

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as the price of computing power,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you could buy a car today

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
for five dollars.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now when the price of any technology

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
declines that dramatically,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the barriers to entry go down.
