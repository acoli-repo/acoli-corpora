00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and the decline of the United States.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
many people said this was

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000

If you look at history, in recent history,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you'll see the cycles of belief
