00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in terms of diffusion of power.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now the problem is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So let me step back

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and ask: what's power?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Power is simple the ability

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to affect others

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to get the outcomes you want,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and you can do it in three ways.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You can do it with threats

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of coercion, "sticks,"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you can do it with payments,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
"carrots,"

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or you can do it by getting others

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to want what you want.
