00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Traditionally, the way people thought about power

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was primarily in terms of military power.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
For example, the great Oxford historian

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
defined a great power

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
as a country able to prevail in war.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But we need a new narrative

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
if we're to understand power in the 21st century.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's not just prevailing at war,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
though war still persists.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's not whose army wins;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it's also whose story wins.
