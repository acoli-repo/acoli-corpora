00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and the fear it created in Sparta.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Notice both halves of that explanation.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Many people argue

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that the 21st century

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
is going to repeat the 20th century,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
in which World War One,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the great conflagration

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in which the European state system

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
tore itself apart

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and destroyed its centrality in the world,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that that was caused by

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the rise in the power of Germany

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and the fear it created in Britain.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So there are people who are telling us

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
this is going to be reproduced today,
