00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the facts, not the myths,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
you may have policies which are very dangerous.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Let me give you an example from history.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The Peloponnesian War

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
was the great conflict

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in which the Greek city state system

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
tore itself apart

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
two and a half millennia ago.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
What caused it?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
said it was the rise in the power of Athens

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and the fear it created in Sparta.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Notice both halves of that explanation.
