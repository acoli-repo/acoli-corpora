00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And what that means

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is not that the age of the State is over.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The State still matters.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But the stage is crowded.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Some of that's good:

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oxfam,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
a great non-governmental actor.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Some of it's bad:

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But think of what it does

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We think in terms of war

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and interstate war.
