00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now someday,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with a billion point three people getting richer,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
they are going to be bigger than the United States.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But be very careful about these projections

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
such as the Goldman Sachs projection

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
as though that gives you an accurate picture

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of power transition in this century.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
First of all, it's a linear projection.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You know, everything says,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
here it goes -- straight line.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
History is not linear.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.
