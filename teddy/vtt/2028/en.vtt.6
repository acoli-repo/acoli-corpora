00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
maybe the Catholic Church --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
but you had to be pretty wealthy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, anybody has that capacity,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which previously was restricted by price

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
just to a few actors.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and if you have Skype, it's free.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So capabilities

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that were once restricted

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
are now available to everyone.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And what that means

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is not that the age of the State is over.
