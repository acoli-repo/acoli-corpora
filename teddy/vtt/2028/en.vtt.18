There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The second thing is

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that the Chinese economy

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
