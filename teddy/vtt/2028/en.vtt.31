00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Wars persist. Power persists.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Military power is important.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Keeping balances is important.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
All this still persists.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Hard power is there,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and it will remain.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But unless you learn how to mix

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
hard power with soft power

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
into strategies that I call smart power,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
that we're facing.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is how do we work together

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to produce global public goods,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
things from which all of us can benefit?
