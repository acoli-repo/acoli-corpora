Anne Helen Petersen:
I'm a person who gets stuff done.

00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:06.366
Like, I always have,
I've never filed late, you know.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.526
If something needs to be done, I do it.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.876
My job is my entire identity.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.306
Adam Grant: Anne Helen Petersen
is a senior culture writer at Buzzfeed.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.806
She covers a wide range of topics,
from Hollywood to The White House.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.716
And sometimes, when Annie writes a story,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.546
the internet trolls
come out of the woodwork.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.570
AHP: I write articles for the internet,

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:27.806
but I'm also told
to kill myself, that I'm fat,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.176
or that someone's going to come
and slit my dog's throat.
