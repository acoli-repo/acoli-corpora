00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:03.768
in Wuhan, they've been
locked down for 11 weeks

00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:06.643
and only now has the Chinese
government decided

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:09.583
they're ready to start letting people
move freely around.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.268
WPR: And to your point earlier

00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:15.851
about some of the possible missteps
in terms of reporting,

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.601
I mean, there are still reports now

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:21.768
that we might not be getting
an accurate number of cases

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:23.976
that we're seeing in Wuhan or beyond,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.518
we're hearing some people say
there are no new cases,

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.643
other people saying
that there actually are cases.

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:33.559
So do you feel like there is
accurate spread of information
