00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:00.309
And I think before we dive into things,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.643
I'd love to hear
about just how things have been

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.934
for you personally,

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.684
your loved ones, those close to you,

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.500
how have you been experiencing this?

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.101
GL: It's complicated.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.851
So we're here in Hong Kong,

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:15.059
I'm working from home,
like much of Hong Kong.

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:18.726
I'm actually self-quarantined
in our apartment here in Hong Kong,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.518
because there was a confirmed case
in our workplace.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.726
So over the course of the last week plus,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.309
and likely for at least another week plus,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.393
the entire organization
has been distributed

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.434
and working from home.
