00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.518
And so a lot of the information
that we're using

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:34.684
to piece together what happened in China
is still not fully complete.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.059
And so with every passing day,
every passing week,

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.351
there's more information

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:41.434
that allows us to retroactively
make sure that we get the picture

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.684
of what happened early on
in those early days

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:44.976
at the end of 2019,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.184
get that picture right.

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.434
And there's still a lot
that's happening today,

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:51.476
even though I think
the information sharing

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.351
is much more open than it was early on,

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.768
there's still a lot of stuff
that we need to parse.

00:04:56.792 --> 00:04:58.518
And the second important caveat here

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.601
is that I think learning
sometimes suggests
