00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.393
so that was the first time
we actually heard about something

00:10:30.417 --> 00:10:31.768
that was going on in Wuhan.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:33.351
The very next day, December 31,

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.726
was the first time
that any Chinese officials --

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.018
and on that day,

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:40.184
it happened to be the actual
provincial and the city officials --

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:42.726
acknowledged that there were 27 people,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.018
at that moment in time,

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:47.934
who had been diagnosed
with this mysterious pneumonia,

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.226
and they reported the cases
to the World Health Organization.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.643
That was also the day
that Dr. Li was reprimanded,

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:55.434
officially reprimanded.

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:57.101
So that was really the discovery,

00:10:57.125 --> 00:10:59.893
the end of the discovery and denial phase,

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:01.893
because what we know now
