00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.768
and therefore not included
in official numbers.

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:34.101
Now, I don't think that this is an example

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.602
of the Chinese government
trying to hide information.

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:37.976
This is a definitions issue,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.684
which countries have been debating

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:42.351
and people are doing it in different ways.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:43.643
But like I said,

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.643
there really have been
three very distinct phases.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:48.268
We are in the third phase

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:51.351
that I would call recovery
and rehabilitation,

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:54.809
rehabilitation being
the rehabilitation of China's image.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:58.643
But the first part was discovery
and a lot of denial.

00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:01.726
And then there was this
two-and-a-half-month period
