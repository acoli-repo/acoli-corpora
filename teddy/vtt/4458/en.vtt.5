and working from home.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.976
You know, when Hong Kong
got its first confirmed case,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.393
I was actually back
in the United States with my wife,

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:41.601
we were taking a small break
in the Rockies,

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:45.476
and we came back to Hong Kong
pretty soon after that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.518
to make sure we got back into Hong Kong
before the airports shut.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:50.809
And at that point,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.559
it was all of our family
in the United States and friends

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.351
texting us and worrying
about how things were in Hong Kong

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.893
as the situation in China
started escalating,

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:02.268
and people were sending us,
or trying to send us, supplies.
