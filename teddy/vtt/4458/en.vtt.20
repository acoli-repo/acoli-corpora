And Li Wenliang, Dr. Li,

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:04.143
posted to a private WeChat
group on December 30.

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.726
These were some of his old
classmates from med school.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.143
And he said, "Hey, I'm in Wuhan,
I'm at the hospital,

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.434
there is a SARS-like illness,"

00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:15.976
SARS being the epidemic from 2002 to 2003,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.726
"There's a SARS-like illness

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.101
that is spreading through
these hospitals in Wuhan."

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:22.393
A private message.

00:10:22.417 --> 00:10:23.684
Somebody forwarded it,

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:26.184
and it went viral
across the Chinese internet.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.476
The very next --

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.393
so that was the first time
we actually heard about something
