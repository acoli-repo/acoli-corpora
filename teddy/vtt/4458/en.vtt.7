00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.143
over just the last couple of weeks.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.434
WPR: And you know,

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.226
I think that's actually
a really interesting place to start

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.559
and probably a question that a lot
of people who aren't in China have,

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.726
you know, I think
from the outside looking in,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.268
it seems as if what's happened in China

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:43.601
is kind of miraculous.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.434
That to go from, you know,

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.893
you have a country with more
than a billion people there,

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:55.601
to go from as many as 80,000 cases
to nearly zero new cases now,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:58.726
you know, what can you tell us
about how this happened,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.601
to help us understand
the current situation
