00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.601
to help us understand
the current situation

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.708
and just really how China ended up there?

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:06.934
GL: Yeah, a lot has happened.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.601
China has been dealing with this
for several months now.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.018
Several-month head start,
that's not a good thing,

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:14.851
but they have gone through
several different phases.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.795
I think, Whitney, before I jump into it,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.838
there are a couple of caveats
that are really important to make.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:23.143
The first one is that we're still
parsing what happened in China.

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.018
The information system, as everyone knows,

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.601
is still relatively closed.

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.518
And so a lot of the information
that we're using
