00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.768
I'd like to welcome to join me
my cohost here,

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:03.917
Whitney Pennington Rodgers.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.809
She's our current affairs curator.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.923
Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
We're going to be looking a little bit

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.184
at China's response today.

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.559
When news surfaced
about a strange viral outbreak

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:14.851
in Wuhan, China

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.393
at the very last days of 2019,

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.059
I think a lot of people were confused
about what was going on there,

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:23.268
and in the months that followed,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:26.851
we learned more about the disease
that's now known as COVID-19,

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.143
we watched the situation
in China quickly worsen
