00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.601
is that I think learning
sometimes suggests

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.851
that everything China did
was right and good,

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:06.518
and hopefully, other countries
can take it and apply it,

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.476
but that's not 100 percent the case.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.559
China, of course,
did a lot that was right,

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:12.476
and if we walked through the time line,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.184
I think it would be pretty apparent

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:17.851
the decisions that they made
kept the coronavirus

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:20.434
from really exploding
across the entire country

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:25.059
and really limited it to one province
and mostly one city.

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:27.268
But there were also many, many missteps,

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.434
and those are things that I think
the world can also learn from,
