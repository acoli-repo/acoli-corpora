00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.059
we understand now
that they are not included,

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:03.351
since February 7,

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.851
they have not been included
in the official numbers.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.976
Or at the very least, on February 7,
they changed that definition,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.434
and they're not included
in those official numbers.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.518
And that could be another 50 percent

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.726
on top of the numbers
that we're seeing today.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.393
So what we've found,

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:21.768
our reporters have gotten their hands
on some classified government documents

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.059
and government data

00:08:23.083 --> 00:08:29.518
that suggests that a third of total
actual positive tests are asymptomatic,

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.768
and therefore not included
in official numbers.
