00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:03.059
I don't think a lot of people
around the world knew the city of Wuhan,

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.726
but it's extremely important.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.226
It is considered the most important city
in the center of China

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.559
for many different reasons,

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:10.851
but one of the key reasons

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:14.351
is that it is one of the key
transportation hubs of the country.

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:15.934
So all of the major train lines,

00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.383
the high-speed train lines,
the normal train lines,

00:16:18.413 --> 00:16:19.601
the trade lines,

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.518
they all kind of converge on Wuhan.

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:25.309
So you can imagine if 400 million
people start moving around

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.518
for Chinese New Year on January 24,

00:16:27.542 --> 00:16:30.059
a huge number of them
were going to go through Wuhan.
