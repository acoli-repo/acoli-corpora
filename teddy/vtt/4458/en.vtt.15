00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:33.559
So do you feel like there is
accurate spread of information

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:37.542
about the current state of the virus
in China right now?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.893
GL: Generally, yes,

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:43.934
with the caveat that it is based
on the Chinese government's definition.

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.934
And this is one of the problems right now

00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.726
that even the World Health
Organization is struggling with,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.143
is that the definition
of what is a confirmed case,

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:52.434
what is an infection,

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:54.268
is different from country to country.

00:07:54.292 --> 00:07:56.018
As an example, in China,

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.934
the folks that have tested positive
but are asymptomatic,

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.059
we understand now
that they are not included,
