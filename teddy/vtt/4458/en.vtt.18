00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:01.726
And then there was this
two-and-a-half-month period

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.726
of response and containment.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.184
And that I think,
the response and containment part

00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:09.184
is the most interesting
to the rest of the world.

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:11.494
WPR: And so maybe we can break
some of that down,

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:13.768
you know, thinking about China's response.

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:15.893
What were some of the specific things

00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:18.101
that you think China did right,

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.601
both as a nation,
individuals in the country,

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:25.101
what were some of the things
that you saw that worked really well?

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:27.684
GL: OK, so let me walk
through the time line,

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:30.976
I want to try and get these dates right,
because the dates do matter,
