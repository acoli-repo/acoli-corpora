he was one of the central figures
during SARS 17 years ago.

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.643
On January 20, he visited Wuhan.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.059
And he admitted, for the first time,

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.393
that human-to-human
transmission was possible.

00:13:10.417 --> 00:13:11.684
Now this was important,

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.476
because prior to that,
officials who had spoken up

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.393
had said that human-to-human
transmission was not likely,

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:20.184
was not possible.

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:21.476
And previous to that,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.059
all of the cases,
the majority of the cases

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:28.476
were tied to this seafood
and wildlife marketplace

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.768
that was in the city of Wuhan.
