00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:02.268
and people were sending us,
or trying to send us, supplies.

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:04.476
Masks and sanitizer and stuff like that.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.018
And now it's the opposite.

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:08.809
New York City is our home,

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:10.309
so we certainly empathize

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.476
with what you guys
are dealing with right now

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.976
and going through in the city.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.018
And we are seeing
our friends and our family

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:19.768
back home in New York and in California

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.309
and checking in on them,

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.101
trying to send equipment
and materials back to them,

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:27.559
so the script has flipped
actually pretty fast

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.143
over just the last couple of weeks.
