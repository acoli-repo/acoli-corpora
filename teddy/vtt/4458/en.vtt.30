00:14:56.875 --> 00:15:01.059
it sounds like, although
there was a slow period

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:03.101
of getting the information out initially,

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:07.643
eventually there was quick reaction
from the Chinese government

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:10.809
to respond to this, lock folks down.

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:14.809
And it seems like that had
a real impact on flattening the curve

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:16.101
in China, in Wuhan.

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:17.393
GL: A real impact.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.684
WPR: Yeah and I --

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:19.976
GL: Absolutely.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.559
WPR: Yes, please go ahead, Gary.

00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:25.143
GL: The date of January 23
was not by coincidence.

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:29.809
Because the Chinese New Year holiday
started on January 24,

00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.226
the very next day.
