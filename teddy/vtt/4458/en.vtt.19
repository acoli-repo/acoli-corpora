00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:30.976
I want to try and get these dates right,
because the dates do matter,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.309
I think again, for context,

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:35.101
how many weeks it took
from one step to another.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.649
Let me actually back up
into that initial first phase,

00:09:37.673 --> 00:09:39.684
that discovery and denial phase.

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:43.726
The first time we heard
about the coronavirus,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.518
this mysterious respiratory disease
that looks somewhat like SARS,

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.101
was on December 30.

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:52.143
That was the day that there was a doctor,

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.476
whose name is known all over the world

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.893
for the unfortunate reason

00:09:55.917 --> 00:09:58.059
he ended up eventually dying,

00:09:58.083 --> 00:09:59.851
named Li Wenliang.

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:01.393
And Li Wenliang, Dr. Li,
