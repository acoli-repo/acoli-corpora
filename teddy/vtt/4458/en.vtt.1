00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:30.851
in the only way that we know how,

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:34.476
which is by having wise humans coming on,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.684
talking to each other,
listening to each other

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:38.809
trying to learn from each other.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.101
We are apart,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.059
but we can use this moment
to build community together,

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:45.833
and that's what we're trying to do.

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:50.809
So this is being produced
by a virtual TED team

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.518
scattered around New York,

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:56.643
currently one of the epicenters
of this pandemic.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.393
So it's definitely a scary time
for people here.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.768
I'd like to welcome to join me
my cohost here,
