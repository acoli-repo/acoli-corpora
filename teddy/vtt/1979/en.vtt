The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The best minds in the best institutions

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
generally get it wrong.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And it's clearly in the area of finance.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
With institutions established to think about the future,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Over 20,000 economists

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
couldn't see what was happening.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Globalization is getting more complex.
