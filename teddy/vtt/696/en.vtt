00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.381
So, I have a strange career.

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:05.521
I know it because people come up to me,
like colleagues, and say,

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.411
"Chris, you have a strange career."

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:09.078
(Laughter)

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:10.421
And I can see their point,

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:14.976
because I started my career
as a theoretical nuclear physicist.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.164
And I was thinking about quarks
and gluons and heavy ion collisions,

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.976
and I was only 14 years old --

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:24.280
No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:26.976
But after that,

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:29.737
I actually had my own lab

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.876
in the Computational
Neuroscience department,
