00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:31.735
one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --

00:13:31.735 --> 00:13:34.480
normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.583
But in this case it happened in real life.

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.202
And it happens in real life all the time.

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.416
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:45.129
It's a meeting or job interview or first date

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:46.803
or some relationship that gets lubricated

00:13:46.803 --> 00:13:50.183
because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:52.734
You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."

00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:54.367
Or your alma mater or your job,

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.284
and I know just a little something about it,

00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:57.833
enough to get the ball rolling.

00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.702
People love that shared connection that gets created

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:01.994
when somebody knows something about you.
