I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.369
and holding my own, back when that was a fad.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.417
There's a weird sense of mastery you get

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:12.662
when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:16.218
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.202
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:26.386
the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.202
I never had a guidance counselor

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:30.586
who thought this was a legitimate career path,
