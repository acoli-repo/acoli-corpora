00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:31.355
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:34.701
I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.826
we'll enter a new golden age of leisure

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:39.119
when we'll all have time for the things we really love

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:46.091
because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.805
I've heard other people say quite the opposite,

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.021
that this is yet another tier of the middle class

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:55.055
that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:56.619
and that this is actually something ominous,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.124
something that we should worry about.

00:08:58.124 --> 00:08:59.973
I'm not an economist myself.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:03.245
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
