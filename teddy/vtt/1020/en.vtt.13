00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:32.632
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,

00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:34.932
and there's the thing in the middle of their court.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:38.168
And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:40.065
cheering on their little darling,

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:42.431
having poured millions of dollars into this

00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.369
hoping against hope that the humans screw up,

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:47.166
and holding up "Go Watson" signs

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:51.814
and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.

00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:57.681
I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.

00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:03.085
If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,
