00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.578
So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.

00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:02.369
And at first, it was very low.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.736
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.920
But then you see the line start to go up.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.403
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.

00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:12.077
And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:18.202
some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.770
And thought, what are these?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.662
"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."

00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:25.854
And I saw this line coming for me.

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:26.954
And I realized, this is it.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.994
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.937
(Laughter)
