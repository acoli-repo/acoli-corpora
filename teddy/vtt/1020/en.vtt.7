00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.918
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:36.152
And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:38.018
People playing computers on game shows

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:41.070
was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.618
and now I could be on the stage with it.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:43.702
I was not going to say no.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:44.835
The third reason I said yes

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.435
is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.571
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.

00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.901
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.101
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program

00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.661
that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English
