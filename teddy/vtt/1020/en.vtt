00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.270
In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.370
of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.220
I mean, nine years is a long time.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.138
And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:12.430
I think what that means

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.621
is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:17.804
(Laughter)

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:19.243
But not all, a few are still alive.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:21.756
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.458
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.912
I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:29.103
For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:32.337
as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
