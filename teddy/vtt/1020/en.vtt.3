00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.912
I was going to miss my game shows.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.602
And later, in the mid-'80s,

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.213
when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:39.286
I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:44.788
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.202
And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:49.619
where there was only one English language TV channel.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.869
There was Armed Forces TV,

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.035
and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:56.351
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."

00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.352
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:04.535
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s
