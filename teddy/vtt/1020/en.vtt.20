And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.953
gets smaller and dumber.

00:10:01.953 --> 00:10:05.744
And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better

00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:09.244
at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?

00:10:09.244 --> 00:10:13.320
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.087
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?

00:10:17.087 --> 00:10:20.959
As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:28.183
this was a terrifying idea to me.

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:33.160
The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.
