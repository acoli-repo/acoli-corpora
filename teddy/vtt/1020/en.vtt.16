And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:05.661
because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.

00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:08.169
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.302
I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score

00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:13.086
from a baseball or football game

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:15.662
and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.087
and was commenting on it.

00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:21.086
And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job

00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:22.521
as the humans they're replacing,

00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:26.338
but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:31.355
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
