00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.339
when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.662
"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:09.746
they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.244
Are you up for this?"

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:12.834
This was the first I'd heard of it.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.502
And of course I said yes, for several reasons.

00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:17.754
One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:21.395
It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.430
(Laughter)

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.835
And I would do it for nothing.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.568
I don't think they know that, luckily,

00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:29.786
but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.918
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
