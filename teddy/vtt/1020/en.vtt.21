The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.369
The things we know are still important.

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.371
I came to believe there were two advantages

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.042
that those of us who have these things in our head have

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:46.868
over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:49.536
There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.

00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:51.092
The advantage of volume, first,

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:53.724
just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.141
There's so much information out there.

00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:56.425
Being a Renaissance man or woman,

00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:58.591
that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.857
Now it's really not possible

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:02.941
to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
