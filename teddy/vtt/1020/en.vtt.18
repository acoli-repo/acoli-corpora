00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:03.245
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.

00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:06.305
And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.536
Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:12.689
and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:15.222
and thousands of processors working in parallel

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.306
and they could do the same thing.

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:20.537
They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,

00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:23.272
and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:27.005
And it made me think, what does this mean,

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:28.744
if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,

00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:32.369
not just lower unimportant brain functions.
