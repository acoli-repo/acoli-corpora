I started to get occasional updates from them,

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.870
and I started to get a little more worried.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.953
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:42.870
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.521
tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.803
with their performance plotted on number of --

00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:52.869
I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.828
clues responded to --

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:57.219
versus the accuracy of those answers.

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.578
So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.
