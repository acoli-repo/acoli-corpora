00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.937
(Laughter)

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:33.119
It's not the Terminator's gun sight;

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.286
it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.421
the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.173
And when the game eventually happened about a year later,

00:05:45.173 --> 00:05:48.036
it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.537
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:52.803
Watson does not travel.

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:53.903
Watson's actually huge.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:58.436
It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.854
trillions of bytes of memory.

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:02.287
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.
