00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:02.941
to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.

00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:04.545
There's just too much.

00:11:04.545 --> 00:11:07.042
They say that the scope of human information

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.091
is now doubling every 18 months or so,

00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.627
the sum total of human information.

00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:15.209
That means between now and late 2014,

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:18.676
we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,

00:11:18.676 --> 00:11:22.756
as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.

00:11:22.756 --> 00:11:24.827
It's doubling every 18 months now.

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:28.186
This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:31.462
require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.
