00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.848
I felt obsolete.

00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:33.899
I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:36.750
seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.841
I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete

00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:45.620
under this new regime of thinking computers.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.577
And it hasn't been the last.

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:50.219

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.911
and I see this all the time --

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.669
that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.078
without actually needing a human pharmacist.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.269
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals
