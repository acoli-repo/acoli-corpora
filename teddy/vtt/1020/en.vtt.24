00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.685
of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:05.652
cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.

00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:08.218
If you can't do that first step,

00:12:08.218 --> 00:12:11.253
are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know

00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:14.219
to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?

00:12:14.219 --> 00:12:15.484
Quite probably not.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.801
At some point you're just going to be like,

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.668
"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."

00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:20.468
And you'll make a less informed decision.

00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:23.952
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.886
if you have all these things at your fingertips.

00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:29.302
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.

00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:31.985
She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England
