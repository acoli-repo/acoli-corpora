00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:02.287
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:05.912
The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.270
You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.327

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:29.965
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:32.632
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,
