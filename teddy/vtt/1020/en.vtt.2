00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.140
with whatever great fact I had just read about --

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.841
Haley's comet or giant squids

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.770
or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.987
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:14.088
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.

00:01:14.088 --> 00:01:15.588
(Laughter)

00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:18.421
And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:21.827
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.352
because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.685
that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.912
I was going to miss my game shows.
