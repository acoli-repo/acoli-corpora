00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then I was an entertainer, I guess.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I never wound up going into college.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's really cool.
