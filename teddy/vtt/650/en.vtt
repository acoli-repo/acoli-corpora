Hi.

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:05.183
You might have noticed
that I have half a beard.

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:07.746
It's not because I lost a bet.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.723
Many years ago, I was badly burned.

00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:12.810
Most of my body is covered with scars,

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:14.682
including the right side of my face.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:17.474
I just don't have hair.
That's just how it happened.

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:19.865
It looks symmetrical, but almost.

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:22.976
Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.878
let's move to social science.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:32.143
And in particular, I want us to think
about where is the potential for humanity
