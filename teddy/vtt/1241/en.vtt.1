00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at the moment in computer games.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We already saw that briefly yesterday.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's one of the most successful games of all time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They pretty much look the same.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And you can see he looks always the same.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The reason for that is that these characters

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are actually not real characters.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They are a graphical visualization of a character.
