00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we think is going to change the way that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That technology is simulating humans.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's simulated humans with a simulated body

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a simulated nervous system to control that body.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, before I talk more about that technology,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at the moment in computer games.
