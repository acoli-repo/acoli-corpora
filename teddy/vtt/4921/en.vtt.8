he pursued Spartacus 
with eight new legions,

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:05.645
eventually trapping the rebels 
in the toe of Italy.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.842
After failed attempts to build rafts,

00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.522
and a stinging betrayal by local pirates,

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:14.612
the rebels made a desperate run 
to break through Crassus’s lines–

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:16.232
but it was no use.

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:19.592
Roman reinforcements were returning 
from the Pontic wars,

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:23.312
and the rebels’ ranks and 
spirits were broken.

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:27.783
In 71 BCE, they made their last stand.

00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:33.359
Spartacus nearly managed to reach Crassus 
before being cut down by centurions.
