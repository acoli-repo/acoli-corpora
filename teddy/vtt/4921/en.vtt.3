00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:32.039
the Senate was too busy with wars in 
Spain and the Pontic Empire

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.859
to worry about some unruly slaves.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.719
Unconcerned, praetor Claudius Glaber took 
an army of three thousand men

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.299
to the rebel’s refuge at Mount Vesuvius,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.599
and blocked off the only passage 
up the mountain.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.639
All that remained was to wait and 
starve them out–

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.419
or so he thought.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:51.447
In the dead of night,

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:56.277
the rebels lowered themselves down the 
cliffside on ropes made from vines,

00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:59.627
and flanked Glaber’s unguarded camp.

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:04.197
Thus began the legend of Rome’s 
defiant gladiator.
