00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:33.359
Spartacus nearly managed to reach Crassus 
before being cut down by centurions.

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:34.949
His army was destroyed,

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.289
and 6000 captives were crucified 
along the Appian Way–

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.179
a haunting demonstration 
of Roman authority.

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.567
Crassus won the war,

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.337
but it is not his legacy which echoes 
through the centuries.

00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:49.777
Thousands of years later,

00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:53.487
the name of the slave who made the 
world’s mightiest empire tremble

00:04:53.487 --> 00:04:55.737
has become synonymous with freedom–

00:04:55.737 --> 00:04:58.397
and the courage to fight for it.
