stealing Varinius’s own horse 
to aid their escape.

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:41.070
Thanks to his inspiring victories 
and policy of distributing spoils equally,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.700
Spartacus continued attracting followers,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.630
and gained control of villages

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.470
where new weapons could be forged.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.060

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.710

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.280
the Senate retaliated with 
the full force of two legions.
