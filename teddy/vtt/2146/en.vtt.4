00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.076
Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.976
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.521
did you catch it? --

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:06.976
is that leadership is over-glorified.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.777
Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first,

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:11.310
and he'll get all the credit,

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:13.124
but it was really the first follower

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.976
that transformed the lone nut
into a leader.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.739
So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.355
that would be really ineffective.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.783
If you really care
about starting a movement,

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:25.976
have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.614
And when you find a lone nut
doing something great,

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:31.976
have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in.
