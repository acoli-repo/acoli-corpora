00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:02.576
It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.496
because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.572
Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after,

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:10.976
three more people.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.420
Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point.

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.221
Now we've got a movement.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:16.245
(Laughter)

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.976
So, notice that, as more people join in,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.564
it's less risky.

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:22.819
So those that were sitting
on the fence before

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.353
now have no reason not to.

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.717
They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed,

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.550
but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry.
