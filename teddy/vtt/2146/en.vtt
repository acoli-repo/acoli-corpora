Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:05.413
and how to make a movement.

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:07.851
So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish,

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.119
in under three minutes

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:10.976
and dissect some lessons from it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.358
First, of course you know,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.800
a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.261
What he's doing is so easy to follow.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.649
Here's his first follower
with a crucial role;

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.976
he's going to show everyone
else how to follow.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.555
Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.524
Now it's not about the leader anymore;

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:29.976
it's about them, plural.
