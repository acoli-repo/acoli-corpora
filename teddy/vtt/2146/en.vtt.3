00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.550
but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:33.306
(Laughter)

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.845
So, over the next minute,

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.631
you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.916
because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.917
And that's how you make a movement.

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.917
But let's recap some lessons from this.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.976
So first, if you are the type,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.976
like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.976
remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.450
so it's clearly
about the movement, not you.

00:01:57.474 --> 00:01:58.536
(Laughter)

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.076
Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here.
