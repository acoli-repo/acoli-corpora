00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.251
William Golding was losing 
his faith in humanity.

00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:13.876
Serving aboard a British destroyer 
in World War II,

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:18.380
the philosophy teacher turned Royal Navy 
lieutenant was constantly confronted

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.060
by the atrocities of his fellow man.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.078
And when he returned to England 
to find Cold War superpowers

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:27.973
threatening one another 
with nuclear annihilation,

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:31.915
he was forced to interrogate 
the very roots of human nature.
