00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about ethnic conflict

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and civil war.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
nor do they generally generate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the kind of good news

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that this conference is about.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yet, not only is there at least some good news

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to be told about fewer such conflicts now

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
than two decades ago,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but what is perhaps more important

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is that we also have come

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to a much better understanding of what can be done
