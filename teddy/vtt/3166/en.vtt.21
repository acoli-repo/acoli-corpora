Well, if you combine our cognitive biases
with the nature of news,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.656
you can see why the world

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.640
for a very long time indeed.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.936

Of course we should be aware
of suffering and danger

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.096
wherever they occur,
