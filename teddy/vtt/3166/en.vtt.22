00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.096
wherever they occur,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.136
but we should also be aware
of how they can be reduced,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.656
because there are dangers
to indiscriminate pessimism.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.336
One of them is fatalism.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.536
If all our efforts at improving the world

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.856
have been in vain,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.736
why throw good money after bad?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.332
The poor will always be with you.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.576
And since the world will end soon --

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.456
if climate change doesn't kill us all,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.936
then runaway artificial
intelligence will --

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.576
a natural response is
to enjoy life while we can,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.360
eat, drink and be merry,
for tomorrow we die.
