00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.736
Much suffering remains

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.496
and tremendous peril,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.256
but ideas on how to reduce them
have been voiced,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.175
and an infinite number of others
are yet to be conceived.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.616
We will never have a perfect world,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.896
and it would be dangerous to seek one.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.455
But there's no limit
to the betterments we can attain

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.359
if we continue to apply knowledge
to enhance human flourishing.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.896
This heroic story
is not just another myth.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.976
Myths are fictions, but this one is true,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.936
true to the best of our knowledge,
which is the only truth we can have.
