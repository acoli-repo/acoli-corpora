00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.456
Progress is not some mystical force
or dialectic lifting us ever higher.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.056
It's not a mysterious arc of history
bending toward justice.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.816
It's the result of human efforts
governed by an idea,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.856
an idea that we associate
with the 18th century Enlightenment,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.216
namely that if we apply reason and science

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.296
that enhance human well-being,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.960
we can gradually succeed.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.136
Is progress inevitable? Of course not.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.176
Progress does not mean
that everything becomes better

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.136
for everyone everywhere all the time.
