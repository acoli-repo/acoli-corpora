00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.376
is not a matter of faith

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.216
or having an optimistic temperament
or seeing the glass as half full.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.080
It's a testable hypothesis.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.096
For all their differences,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.496
people largely agree
on what goes into human well-being:

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.216
life, health, sustenance, prosperity,
peace, freedom, safety, knowledge,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.216
leisure, happiness.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.136
All of these things can be measured.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.496
If they have improved over time,
that, I submit, is progress.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.136
Let's go to the data,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.776
beginning with the most
precious thing of all, life.
