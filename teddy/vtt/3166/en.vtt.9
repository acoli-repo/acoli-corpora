beginning with the most
precious thing of all, life.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.376
For most of human history,
life expectancy at birth was around 30.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.176
Today, worldwide, it is more than 70,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.136
and in the developed parts of the world,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.360
more than 80.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.176
250 years ago, in the richest
countries of the world,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.216
a third of the children
did not live to see their fifth birthday,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.576
before the risk was brought
down a hundredfold.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.856
Today, that fate befalls
less than six percent of children

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.720
in the poorest countries of the world.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.016
Famine is one of the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.
