WEBVTT

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.896
We are endowed with the power
to combine ideas recursively,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.376
to have thoughts about our thoughts.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.296
We have an instinct for language,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.760
allowing us to share the fruits
of our ingenuity and experience.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.416
We are deepened
with the capacity for sympathy,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.560
for pity, imagination,
compassion, commiseration.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.256
These endowments have found ways
to magnify their own power.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.296
The scope of language has been augmented

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.160
by the written, printed
and electronic word.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.296
Our circle of sympathy has been expanded

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.400
by history, journalism
and the narrative arts.
