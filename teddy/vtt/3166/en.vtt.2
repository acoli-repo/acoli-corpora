What does the trajectory
of the world look like

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.616
when we measure well-being over time
using a constant yardstick?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.336
Let's compare the most recent
data on the present

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360
with the same measures 30 years ago.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.456
Last year, Americans killed each other

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.856
had seven percent
of their citizens in poverty

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.136
and emitted 21 million tons
of particulate matter

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.256
and four million tons of sulfur dioxide.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.416
But 30 years ago, the homicide rate
was 8.5 per hundred thousand,
