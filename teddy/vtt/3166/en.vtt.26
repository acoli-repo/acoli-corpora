00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.056
like Deep Decarbonization
for climate change

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.280
and Global Zero for nuclear war.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.656
Finally, does the Enlightenment
go against human nature?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.976
This is an acute question for me,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.416
because I'm a prominent advocate
of the existence of human nature,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.856
with all its shortcomings
and perversities.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.296
In my book "The Blank Slate,"

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.456
I argued that the human prospect
is more tragic than utopian

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.216
and that we are not stardust,
we are not golden

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.776
and there's no way
we are getting back to the garden.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.296
