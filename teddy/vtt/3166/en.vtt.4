00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.776
37 percent of the world population
in extreme poverty

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.600
and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.735
True, last year was a terrible year
for terrorism in Western Europe,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.976
with 238 deaths,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.200
but 1988 was worse with 440 deaths.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.976
What's going on?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.496
Was 1988 a particularly bad year?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.576
Or are these improvements a sign
that the world, for all its struggles,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.240
gets better over time?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.600
Might we even invoke the admittedly
old-fashioned notion of progress?
