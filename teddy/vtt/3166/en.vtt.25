00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.136
for everyone everywhere all the time.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.416
That would be a miracle,
and progress is not a miracle

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.640
but problem-solving.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.216
Problems are inevitable

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.920
and solutions create new problems
which have to be solved in their turn.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.456
The unsolved problems
facing the world today are gargantuan,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.256
including the risks of climate change

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.896
and nuclear war,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.456
but we must see them
as problems to be solved,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.896
not apocalypses in waiting,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.176
and aggressively pursue solutions

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.056
like Deep Decarbonization
for climate change
