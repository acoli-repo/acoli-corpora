Boring.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.216
At the same time, the most common response
I have received from readers is gratitude,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.616
gratitude for changing
their view of the world

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.176
from a numb and helpless fatalism

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.856
to something more constructive,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.616
even heroic.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.816
I believe that the ideals
of the Enlightenment

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.856
can be cast a stirring narrative,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.696
and I hope that people
with greater artistic flare

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.736
and rhetorical power than I

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.776
can tell it better and spread it further.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.240
It goes something like this.
