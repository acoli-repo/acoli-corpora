00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.216
with the rah-rah spirit
of boardroom ideology,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.296
Silicon Valley
and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.176
You are a practitioner of Whig history,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.336
a naive optimist, a Pollyanna
and, of course, a Pangloss,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.016
alluding to the Voltaire
character who declared,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.376
"All is for the best
in the best of all possible worlds."

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.896
Well, Professor Pangloss,
as it happens, was a pessimist.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.576
A true optimist believes
there can be much better worlds

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.136
than the one we have today.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.816
But all of this is irrelevant,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.616
because the question
of whether progress has taken place

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.376
is not a matter of faith
