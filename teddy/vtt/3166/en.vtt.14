00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.416
89 percent less likely
to be killed by an act of God,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.376
such as a drought, flood,
wildfire, storm, volcano,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.056
landslide, earthquake or meteor strike,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.336
presumably not because God
has become less angry with us

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.096
but because of improvements
in the resilience of our infrastructure.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.376
And what about
the quintessential act of God,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.896
the projectile hurled by Zeus himself?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.160
Yes, we are 97 percent less likely
to be killed by a bolt of lightning.
