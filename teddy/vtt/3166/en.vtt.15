Before the 17th century,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.696
no more than 15 percent of Europeans
could read or write.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.856
Europe and the United States
achieved universal literacy

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.816
by the middle of the 20th century,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.336
and the rest of the world is catching up.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.776
Today, more than 90 percent
of the world's population

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.240
under the age of 25 can read and write.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.416
In the 19th century, Westerners
worked more than 60 hours per week.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.360
Today, they work fewer than 40.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.856
Thanks to the universal penetration
of running water and electricity
