00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.871
About a dozen years ago,
I was on an airplane,

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:04.656
early, early morning flight
on my way to Ecuador.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.402
And normally, I would just
put on my headphones

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:12.357
and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,

00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:14.140
but I decided to take a little risk,

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:17.022
and I started a conversation
with the man sitting next to me.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:20.253
I introduced myself,
and I learned that he was a publisher.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.036
Interesting.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.308
We ended up having
a fascinating conversation.

00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:28.125
I learned all about the future
of the publishing industry.

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.340
So about three quarters
of the way through the flight,
