00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:33.097
But it was the winds
that we didn't expect in the first place.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:36.374
Over the course
of the last couple of years,

00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:39.406
I've come up with
some tactics for my own life

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.707
to help me really foster appreciation.

00:07:42.287 --> 00:07:45.835
My favorite is that at the end
of every single day,

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:49.605
I look at my calendar
and I review all the people I met with,

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.685
and I send thank-you notes
to every single person.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:54.883
It only takes a few minutes,

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.686
but at the end of every day,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.979
I feel incredibly grateful
and appreciative,
