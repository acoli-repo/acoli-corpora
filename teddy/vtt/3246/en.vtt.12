that they could be spending
on themselves or someone else,

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:03.619
and you need to acknowledge
what they're doing.

00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:08.941
Now, I run three fellowship
programs at Stanford,

00:06:08.965 --> 00:06:11.062
and they are very competitive to get into,

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:14.327
and when I send out the letters
to those students who don't get in,

00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:17.352
I always know there are going to be
people who are disappointed.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:20.556
Some of the people who are disappointed
send me notes, complaining.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.183
Some of them send notes

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.655
saying what could I do to make myself
more successful next time around?

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:26.990
And every once in a while,

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:30.353
someone sends me a note
thanking me for the opportunity.
