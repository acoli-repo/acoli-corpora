00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:02.174
and he decided to do a project
on looking at leadership in that context.

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:06.165
We got to know each other
incredibly well through that quarter,

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:08.594
and he took the project
that he started working on

00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:09.928
in the independent study

00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:14.432
and turned it, ultimately,
into a company called Play for Tomorrow,

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:17.427
where he teaches kids
from disadvantaged backgrounds

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.257
how to, essentially,
craft the lives they dream to live.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:24.178
Now, the important thing about this story

00:07:24.202 --> 00:07:27.322
is that we both ended up catching
the winds of luck

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.558
as a result of his thank-you note.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:33.097
But it was the winds
that we didn't expect in the first place.
