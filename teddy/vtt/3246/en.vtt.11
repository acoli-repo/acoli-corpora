The second thing you want to do

00:05:34.552 --> 00:05:37.261

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:46.556
is playing a huge role
in getting you to your goals.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.191

00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:53.262
but you're missing an opportunity.

00:05:57.914 --> 00:06:01.114
that they could be spending
on themselves or someone else,
