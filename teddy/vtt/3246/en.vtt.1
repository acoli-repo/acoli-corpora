00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:31.842
Apparently.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.501
That's the operative word.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.542
It looks like it's chance

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:41.724
because we rarely see all the levers
that come into play to make people lucky.

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:44.741
But I've realized, by watching so long,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.098
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.876
isolated and dramatic.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.815
It's much more like the wind,

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.405
blowing constantly.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.998
Sometimes it's calm,

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:58.123
and sometimes it blows in gusts,

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:02.372
and sometimes it comes from directions
that you didn't even imagine.
