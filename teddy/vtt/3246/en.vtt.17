And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas
are often something truly remarkable.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.418
One of my favorite exercises
in my classes on creativity

00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:39.504
is to help students foster an attitude
of looking at terrible ideas

00:08:39.528 --> 00:08:42.683
through the lens of possibilities.

00:08:43.337 --> 00:08:45.474
So I give them a challenge:

00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:48.723
to create an idea
for a brand new restaurant.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.174
They have to come up
with the best ideas for a new restaurant

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.767
and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:58.250
So the best ideas are things like
a restaurant on a mountaintop

00:08:58.274 --> 00:08:59.809
with a beautiful sunset,

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.729
or a restaurant on a boat
with a gorgeous view.
