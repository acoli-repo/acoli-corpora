00:10:58.288 --> 00:11:02.240
But the winds of luck are always there,

00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:05.319
and if you're willing to take some risks,

00:11:05.343 --> 00:11:08.851
if you're willing to really go out
and show appreciation

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:13.296
and willing to really look at ideas,
even if they're crazy,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.089
through the lens of possibilities,

00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:19.515
you can build a bigger and bigger sail
to catch the winds of luck.

00:11:19.872 --> 00:11:21.023
Thank you.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:26.095
