00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.363
to get out of their comfort zone
and take some risks.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:03.132
How do I do this?

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:07.028
Well, I start out by having them
fill out a risk-o-meter.

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:09.832
Now, it's basically a fun thing
we developed in our class

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:12.886
where they map out what risks
they're willing to take.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.814
And it becomes clear very quickly to them

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:17.914
that risk-taking is not binary.

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:22.073
There are intellectual risks
and physical risks and financial risks

00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:26.085
and emotional risks and social risks
and ethical risks and political risks.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.894
And once they do this, they compare
their risk profiles with others,

00:02:29.918 --> 00:02:33.220
and they quickly realize
that they're all really different.
