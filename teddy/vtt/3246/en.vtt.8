00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.852
and I said, "Mark, would you
like to come to my class?

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:03.630
I'm doing a project
on reinventing the book,

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:04.963
the future of publishing."

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:06.845
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.204
So he came to my class.
We had a great experience.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.327
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.017
This time, I sent him
a bunch of video clips

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.279
from another project my students had done.

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:19.694
He was so intrigued

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.900
by one of the projects
the students had done,

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.898
he thought there might be a book in it,

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:26.065
and he wanted to meet those students.

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:28.587
I have to tell you,
I was a little bit hurt.

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:29.612
(Laughter)

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.661
I mean, he wanted to do a book
with my students and not with me,
