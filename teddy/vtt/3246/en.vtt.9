00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.661
I mean, he wanted to do a book
with my students and not with me,

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:33.836
but OK, it's all right.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.367
So I invited him to come down,
and he and his colleagues came to Stanford

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.835
and met with the students,
and afterwards, we had lunch together.

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.463
And one of his editors said to me,

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:46.288
"Hey, have you ever
considered writing a book?"

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:48.915
I said, "Funny you should ask."

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.034
And I pulled out the exact same proposal

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.422
that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

00:04:55.446 --> 00:04:57.866
Within two weeks, I had a contract,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.771
and within two years, the book had sold
over a million copies around the world.
