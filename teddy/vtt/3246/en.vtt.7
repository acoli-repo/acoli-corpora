00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.340
So about three quarters
of the way through the flight,

00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:33.145
I decided to take another risk,

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:37.129
and I opened up my laptop
and I shared with him a book proposal

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:41.129
I put together for something
I was doing in my class.

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:42.877
And he was very polite, he read it,

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.663
and he said, "You know what, Tina,
this isn't right for us,

00:03:45.687 --> 00:03:47.354
but thank you so much for sharing."

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:49.411
It's OK. That risk didn't work out.

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:51.201
I shut my laptop.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:54.226
At the end of the flight,
we exchanged contact information.

00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.186
A couple of months later,
I reached out to him,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.852
and I said, "Mark, would you
like to come to my class?
