and sometimes it comes from directions
that you didn't even imagine.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.869
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:08.375
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:11.795
So I'm going to share
three things with you

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:17.003
that you can do to build a sail
to capture the winds of luck.

00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.586
The first thing you want to do

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.115
is to change your relationship
with yourself.

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.251
Be willing to take small risks
that get you out of your comfort zone.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.671
Now, when we're children,
we do this all the time.
