00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.878
We have to do this if we're going
to learn how to walk or talk

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.060
or ride a bike

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.028
or even quantum mechanics. Right?

00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:39.976
We need to go from someone one week
who doesn't ride a bike

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.783
to, next week, someone who does.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:44.361
And this requires us to get
out of our comfort zone

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:46.188
and take some risks.

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:48.331
The problem is, as we get older,

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:50.236
we rarely do this.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.507
We sort of lock down
the sense of who we are

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.329
and don't stretch anymore.

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:55.951
Now, with my students,

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:58.831
I spend a lot of time
giving them encouragement

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.363
to get out of their comfort zone
and take some risks.
