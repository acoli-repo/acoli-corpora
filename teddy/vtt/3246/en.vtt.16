So first, you need to take some risks
and get out of your comfort zone.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.476
Second, you need to show appreciation.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.396
And third, you want to change
your relationship with ideas.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.698
Most people look at new ideas
that come there way and they judge them.

00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:20.478
"That's a great idea"
or "That's a terrible idea."

00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:23.486
But it's actually much more nuanced.

00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.058
Ideas are neither good or bad.

00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:30.888
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas
are often something truly remarkable.
