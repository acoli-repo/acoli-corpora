00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.135
I've spent nearly two decades

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.712
observing what makes people
luckier than others

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.299
and trying to help people
increase their luck.

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.747
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.320
and we all know
that most new ventures fail,

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:20.977
and innovators and entrepreneurs
need all the luck they can get.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:23.316
So what is luck?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.380
Luck is defined as success or failure
apparently caused by chance.
