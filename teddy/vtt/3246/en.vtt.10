00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.771
and within two years, the book had sold
over a million copies around the world.

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:04.381
(Applause)

00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:06.437
Now, you might say,

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.810
"Oh, you're so lucky."

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.105
But of course I was lucky,

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.453
but that luck resulted
from a series of small risks I took,

00:05:13.477 --> 00:05:15.747
starting with saying hello.

00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:18.160
And anyone can do this,

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.947
no matter where you are in your life,

00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:21.831
no matter where you are in the world --

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:25.141
even if you think
you're the most unlucky person,

00:05:25.165 --> 00:05:29.454
you can do this by taking little risks
that get you out of your comfort zone.

00:05:29.478 --> 00:05:31.807
You start building a sail to capture luck.
