00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A month ago today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I stood there:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
90 degrees south, the top of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Together we had just broken the world speed record

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for a trek to the South Pole.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It took us 33 days,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We shaved five days off the previous best time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And in the process, I became the first person in history
