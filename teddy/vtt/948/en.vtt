00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few months ago

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the Nobel Prize in physics

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was awarded to two teams of astronomers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for a discovery that has been hailed

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as one of the most important

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
astronomical observations ever.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And today, after briefly describing what they found,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for explaining their discovery,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
namely the possibility

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that way beyond the Earth,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we may find that our universe

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is not the only universe,
