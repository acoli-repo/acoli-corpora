00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:12.686
Your mortal enemy has captured you
and hooked you up to a bizarre experiment.

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:17.254
He’s extended your nervous system 
with one very long neuron

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:20.844
to a target about 70 meters away.

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.122
At some point, 
he’s going to fire an arrow.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:28.439
If you can then think a thought 
to the target before the arrow hits it,

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.079
he’ll let you go.
