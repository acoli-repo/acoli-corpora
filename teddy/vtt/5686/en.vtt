00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.479
About three years ago,

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:03.860
I lost my daughter.

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.146
She was sexually assaulted and murdered.

00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:10.465
She was my only child

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:11.932
and was just 19.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.439
As the shock wore off

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:18.431
and the all-consuming grief took over,

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.565
I lost all meaning and purpose in life.

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:24.446
Then my daughter spoke to me.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.379
She asked me to keep living.

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:29.719
If I am not around,

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:32.305
she will have one less heart
to continue to live in.
