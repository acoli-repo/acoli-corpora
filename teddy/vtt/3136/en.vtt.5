00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.960
About the size of the state of New Jersey.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.136
Well, you either make
a decision to go further,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.456
without much economic return,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.960
or go back to the dock.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.096
As a scientist, I have access
to high-tech equipment

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.976
that we can put over the side
of the research vessel,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.856
and it measures oxygen
and many more things.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.176
We start at the Mississippi River,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.696
we crisscross the Gulf of Mexico
all the way to Texas,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.360
and even I sneak into Texas
every now and then and test their waters.
