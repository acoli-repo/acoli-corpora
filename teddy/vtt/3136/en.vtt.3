00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640
stimulate the growth of microscopic plants
called phytoplankton.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.336
And small animals called zooplankton
eat the phytoplankton,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.296
small fish eat the zooplankton,
large fish eat the small fish

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.096
and it goes on up into the food web.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.656
The problem is that there's just too much
nitrogen and phosphorus right now,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.896
too much phytoplankton
falling to the bottom

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.416
and decomposed by bacteria
that use up the oxygen.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.200
That's the biology.
