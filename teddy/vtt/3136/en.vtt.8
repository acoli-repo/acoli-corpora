00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.800
And you know you're in the dead zone.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.296
So, what's the connection
between the middle of the United States

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.416
and the Gulf of Mexico?

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.800
Well, most of the watershed is farmland.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.480
And in particular, corn-soybean rotation.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.616
The nitrogen that is put in fertilizers
and the phosphorus goes on the land

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.616
and drains off into the Mississippi River

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.840
and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico.
