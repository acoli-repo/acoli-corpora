00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.800
lead to the formation
of areas called dead zones.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.560
Now, dead zone is a quite ominous word

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.936
if you're a fish or a crab.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.496
(Laughter)

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.496
Even a little worm in the sediments.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.576
Which means that there's not enough oxygen

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.240
for those animals to survive.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.416
So, how does this happen?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.656
The nitrogen and the phosphorus

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640
stimulate the growth of microscopic plants
called phytoplankton.
