But I truly believe that, as a scientist,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.656
using mostly federal funds
to do the research,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.816
I owe it to the public,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.336
to agency heads and congressional people

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.936
to share my knowledge with them

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.856
so they can use it,
hopefully to make better decisions

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.040
about our environmental policy.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.416
(Applause)

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.696
Thank you.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.416
(Applause)
