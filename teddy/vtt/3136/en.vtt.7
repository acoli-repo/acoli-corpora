00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.936
And when you get into the water,
there's a lot of fish.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.856
Tons of fish, all kinds of fish,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.096
including my buddy here,
the barracuda that I saw one day.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.496
Everybody else swam this way
and I went this way with my camera.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.536
(Laughter)

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.176
And then, down at 30 feet
you start to see fewer fish.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.376
And then you get to the bottom.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.616
And you don't see any fish.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.296
There's no life on the platform,
there's no life swimming around.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.800
And you know you're in the dead zone.
