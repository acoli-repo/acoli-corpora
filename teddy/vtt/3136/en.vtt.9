00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.256
There's three times more
nitrogen in the water

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.056
in the Mississippi now,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.296
than there was in the 1950s.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.736
Three times.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.776
And phosphorus has doubled.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.880
And what that means is more phytoplankton
and more sinking sails and lower oxygen.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.000
This is not a natural feature of the Gulf;
it's been caused by human activities.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.656
The landscape is not what it used to be.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.616
It used to be prairies and forests
and prairie potholes
