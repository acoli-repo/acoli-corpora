00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.416
you might find something like this

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.936
which looks like spilled green paint
and smells like it,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.496
growing on the surface of the water.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.376
This is a toxic blue-green algal bloom

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.440
and it is not good for you.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.616
Similarly, in Lake Erie,
couple of summers ago

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.536
there was hundreds of miles
of this blue-green algae

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.896
and the city of Toledo, Ohio,
couldn't use it for their drinking water

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.776
for several days on end.
