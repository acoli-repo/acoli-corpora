Good evening, welcome to New Orleans.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.776
I don't know if you knew this,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.136
but you are sitting within 15 minutes
of one of the largest rivers in the world:

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.440
the Mississippi river.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.800
Old Man River, Big Muddy.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.056
And it goes as far north
as the state of Minnesota,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.416
as far east as the state of New York,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.096
as far west as Montana.
