00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.616
And I said, "Well, you know,
there's the proof."

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.336
And we've go to do something about it.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.096
At the same time,
Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.016
was having trouble with harmful
algal blooms in the Gulf of Maine.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.936
They joined forces -- it was bipartisan --

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.256
(Laughter)

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.736
(Applause)

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.656
And invited me to give
congressional testimony,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.736
and I said, "Oh, all I've done
is chase crabs around south Texas,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.176
I don't know how to do that."

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.416
(Laughter)

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.656
But I did it.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.176
(Cheers)
