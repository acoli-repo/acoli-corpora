00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.616
It feeds a lot of chickens, hogs, cattle

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.896
and it generates ethanol

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.296
to put into our gasoline,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.320
which is regulated by federal policy.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.640
We can do better than this.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.640
We need to make decisions

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.000
that make us less consumptive

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.080
and reduce our reliance on nitrogen.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.096
It's like a carbon footprint.
