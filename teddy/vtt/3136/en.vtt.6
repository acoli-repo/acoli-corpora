00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.360
and even I sneak into Texas
every now and then and test their waters.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.296
And you can tell by the bottom oxygen --

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.496
you can draw a map
of everything that's less than two,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.200
which is the magic number
for when the fish start to leave the area.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.960
I also dive in this dead zone.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.016
We have oxygen meters
that we have to deploy offshore

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.440
that tell us continuous measurements
of low oxygen or high oxygen.
