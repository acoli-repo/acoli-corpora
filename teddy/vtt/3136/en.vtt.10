00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.616
It used to be prairies and forests
and prairie potholes

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.736
and duck areas and all kinds of stuff.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.040
But not anymore -- it's row crops.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.736
And there are ways that we can address
this type of agriculture

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.056
by using less fertilizer,
maybe precision fertilizing.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.496
And trying some sustainable agriculture

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.056
such as perennial wheatgrass,
which has much longer roots

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.696
than the six inches of a corn plant,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.320
that can keep the nitrogen on the soil
and keep the soil from running off.
