as far west as Montana.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.456
And 100 miles from here, river miles,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.080
it empties its fresh water and sediments
into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.256
That's the end of Geography 101.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.376
(Laughter)

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.336
Now we're going to go
to what is in that water.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.320
Besides the sediment, there are dissolved
molecules, nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.280
And those, through a biological process,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.800
lead to the formation
of areas called dead zones.
