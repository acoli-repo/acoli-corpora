00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.200
That's the biology.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.256
Now, you can't see it
from the surface of the water,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.736
you can't see it in satellite images,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.936
so how do we know it's there?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.736
Well, a trawler can tell you,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.096
when she puts her net over the side
and drags for 20 minutes

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.936
and comes up empty,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.256
that she knows she's in the dead zone.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.616
And she has to go somewhere else.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.496
But where else do you go
if this area is 8,000 square miles big?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.960
About the size of the state of New Jersey.
