00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.096
It's like a carbon footprint.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.136
But you can reduce
your nitrogen footprint.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.560
I do it by not eating much meat --

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.456
I still like a little
every now and then --

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.960
not using corn oil,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.656
driving a car that I can put
nonethanol gas in

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.480
and get better gas mileage.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.056
Just things like that
that can make a difference.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.736
So I'm challenging, not just you,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.176
but I challenge a lot of people,
especially in the Midwest --
