00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.056
because it is the end
of the 30-year cycle,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.336
and it's the birthday
of the global food system.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.576
That's the first birthday
I want to talk about.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.336
If we really think that this is something
that's happened in the last 30 years,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.616
there's hope in that.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.496
It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.456
and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets,
high-fructose corn syrup,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.736
the farm crisis in America

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.896
and the change in how we've addressed
agriculture internationally.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.776
So there's a lot of reasons
to take this 30-year time period

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.256
as sort of the creation
of this new food system.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.416
I'm not the only one who's obsessed
with this whole 30-year thing.
