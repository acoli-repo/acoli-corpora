The icons like Michael Pollan
and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.096
both addressed this last
three-decade time period

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.136
as incredibly relevant
for food system change.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.736
Well, I really care about 1980

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.896
because it's also the 30th
anniversary of me this year.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.576
And so in my lifetime,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.536
a lot of what's happened in the world --

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.496
and being a person obsessed with food --

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.376
a lot of this has really changed.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.496
So my second dream is that I think
we can look to the next 30 years

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.936
as a time to change the food system again.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.896
And we know what's happened in the past,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.096
so if we start now
and we look at technologies
