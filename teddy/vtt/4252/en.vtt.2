While I was working at the UN,
I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.067
And she had this really awesome idea
to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" --

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.536
which is really beautifully ironic
because you can strap on the Feed Bag.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.296
But each bag we'd sell would provide

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.856
a year's worth
of school meals for one kid.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.776
It's so simple, and we thought, OK,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.176
it costs between 20 and 50 bucks
to provide school feeding for a year.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.256
We could sell these bags
and raise a ton of money and awareness

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.696
for the World Food Programme.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.776
But at the UN,
sometimes things move slowly

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.136
and they basically said no.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.776
And we thought, this is such a good idea,
it's going to raise so much money.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.136
So we said screw it,
we'll start our own company,
