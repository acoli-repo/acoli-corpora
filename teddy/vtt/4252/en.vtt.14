WEBVTT

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.096
so if we start now
and we look at technologies

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.296
and improvements
to the food system long-term,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.416
we might be able
to recreate the food system

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.776
so when I give my next talk
and I'm 60 years old,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.936
I'll be able to say
that it's been a success.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.616
So I'm announcing today
the start of a new organization,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.656
or a new fund within the FEED Foundation,
called the 30 Project.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.416
And the 30 Project is really focused

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.256
on these long-term ideas
for food system change.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.776
And I think by aligning international
advocates that are addressing hunger

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.216
and domestic advocates
that are addressing obesity,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.576
we might actually look
for long-term solutions

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.016
that will make the food system
better for everyone.
