00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.536
as bifurcated problems
that are very separate,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.456
it's really important
to look at them as one system.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.856
We get a lot of our food
from all around the world

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.056
and people from all around the world
are importing our food system,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.096
so it's incredibly relevant
to start a new way of looking at it.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.376
I've learned --
and the technology people here,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.896
which I'm totally not one of --

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.856
but apparently, it really takes 30 years

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.696
for a lot of technologies
to become really endemic to us,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.216
like the mouse
and the Internet and Windows.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.856
You know, there's 30-year cycles.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.016
I think 2010 can be
a really interesting year

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.056
because it is the end
of the 30-year cycle,
