And agriculture is where food comes from.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.216
Agriculture in America's very interesting.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.976
It's very consolidated

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.936
and the foods that are produced
lead to the foods that we eat.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.136
The foods that are produced are,
more or less, corn, soy and wheat.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.816
And that's three-quarters
of the food that we're eating:

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.376
processed foods and fast foods.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.416
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.896
we haven't done a good job
in the last three decades

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.256
of exporting those technologies
around the world.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.616
So African agriculture, which is the place
of most hunger in the world,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.336
has actually fallen precipitously
as hunger has risen.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.456
So somehow we're not making the connect
