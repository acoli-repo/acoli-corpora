WEBVTT

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.136
So we said screw it,
we'll start our own company,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.589
which we did, three years ago.

00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:36.416
That was my first dream,
to start this company called FEED,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.336
and here's a screenshot of our website.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.016
We did a bag for Haiti
just a month after the earthquake

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.096
to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.336
So FEED's doing great.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.336
We've so far provided 55 million meals
to kids around the world

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.776
by selling now 550,000 bags,
a ton of bags, a lot of bags.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.536
All this time you're really --

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.416
hunger is a hard thing to think about,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.296
because what we think about is eating.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.576
I think about eating a lot
and I really love it.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.216
And the thing that's strange
about international hunger
