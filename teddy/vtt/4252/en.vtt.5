00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.416
is that both hunger and obesity
have really risen in the last 30 years.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.016
Unfortunately, obesity's
not only an American problem.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.376
It's actually been spreading
all around the world

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.456
and mainly through our kind
of food systems that we're exporting.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.896
The numbers are pretty crazy.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.016
There's a billion people
obese or overweight

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.416
and a billion people hungry.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.696
So those seem like
two bifurcated problems,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.936
but I kind of started
to think about, you know,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.296
what is obesity and hunger?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.936
What are both those things about?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.416
Well, they're both about food.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.416
And when you think about food,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.256
the underpinning of food in both cases
is potentially problematic agriculture.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.176
And agriculture is where food comes from.
