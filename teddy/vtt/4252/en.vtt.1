00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.696
So I took a job at the United Nations
World Food Programme

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.976
as a way to try to address
these security issues

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.416
through food security issues.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.933
There, I came across what I think
is the most brilliant of their programs.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.582
It's called School Feeding
and it's a really simple idea

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:45.186
to get in the middle
of the cycle of poverty and hunger

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.303
that continues for a lot of people
around the world, and stop it.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.296
A free school meal gets kids into school,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.696
which is education,
the first step out of poverty,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.216
but it also gives them the micronutrients
and the macronutrients they need

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.936
to develop mentally and physically.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.376
While I was working at the UN,
I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.
