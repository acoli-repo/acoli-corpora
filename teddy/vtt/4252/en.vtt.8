Most hungry people in the world
are subsistence farmers.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.136
And most of those people are women --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.056
which is a totally other topic
that I won't get on right now,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.536
but I'd love to do
the feminist thing at some point.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.136
I think it's really interesting to look
at agriculture from these two sides.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.856
There's this large, consolidated farming
that's led to what we eat in America,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.856
and it's really been since around 1980,
after the oil crisis,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.696
when, you know -- mass consolidation,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.936
mass exodus of small farmers
in this country.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.576
And then in the same time period,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.576
we've kind of left Africa's farmers
to do their own thing.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.456
Unfortunately, what is farmed
ends up as what we eat.
