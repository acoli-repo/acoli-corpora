00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.056
especially in cities,
which are growing really rapidly --

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.376
people are eating
American processed foods.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.736
And in one generation,
they're going from hunger

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.736
and all of the detrimental
health effects of hunger

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.376
to obesity and things like diabetes
and heart disease in one generation.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.056
So the problematic food system
is affecting both hunger and obesity.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.256
Not to beat a dead horse,
but this is a global food system

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.376
where there's a billion people hungry
and a billion people obese.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.456
I think that's the only way to look at it.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.336
And instead of taking these two things

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.536
as bifurcated problems
that are very separate,
