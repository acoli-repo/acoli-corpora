And how are we going
to get those kids those nutritious foods?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.296
Another thing that's become incredibly

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.056
Understanding how to produce protein

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.096

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.376
and healthy for people

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.536

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.856

And I also think that thinking
about processed foods in a new way,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.616
where we actually
price the negative externalities
