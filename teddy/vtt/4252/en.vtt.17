00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.616
where we actually
price the negative externalities

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.336
like petrochemicals
and like fertilizer runoff

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.176
into the price of a bag of chips --

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.856
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes
inherently more expensive than an apple,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.056
then maybe it's time for a different sense
of personal responsibility in food choice

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.016
because the choices are actually choices

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.976
instead of three-quarters of the products
being made just from corn, soy and wheat.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.416
The 30Project.org is launched

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.376
and I've gathered a coalition
of a few organizations to start.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.576
And it'll be growing
over the next few months.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.936
But I really hope
that you will all think of ways

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.696
that you can look long-term
at things like the food system
