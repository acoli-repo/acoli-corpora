00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.456
So somehow we're not making the connect

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.816
between exporting
a good agricultural system

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.096
that will help feed people
all around the world.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.416
Who is farming?
That's what I was wondering.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.056
So I went and stood
on a big grain bin in the Midwest,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.456
and that really didn't help me
understand farming,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.376
but I think it's a really cool picture.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.336
And the reality is
that between farmers in America --

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.296
who actually, quite frankly,
when I spend time in the Midwest,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.056
are pretty large in general.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.896
And their farms are also large.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.896
But farmers in the rest of the world
are actually quite skinny,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.635
and that's because they're starving.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.296
Most hungry people in the world
are subsistence farmers.
