00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.016
that will make the food system
better for everyone.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.816
We all tend to think
that these systems are quite different

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.616
and people argue whether or not
organic can feed the world,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.056
but if we take a 30-year view,
there's more hope in collaborative ideas.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.056
So I'm hoping that by connecting
really disparate organizations

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.816
like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.216
which don't seem right now
to have much in common,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.096
we can talk about holistic,
long-term, systemic solutions

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.056
that will improve food for everyone.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.509
Some ideas I've had is like,
look, the reality is --

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.976
kids in the South Bronx
need apples and carrots

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.656
and so do kids in Botswana.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.616
And how are we going
to get those kids those nutritious foods?
