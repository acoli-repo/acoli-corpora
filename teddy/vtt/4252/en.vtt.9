Unfortunately, what is farmed
ends up as what we eat.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.496
And in America, a lot of what we eat
has led to obesity

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.496
and has led to a real change

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.160
in sort of what our diet is,
in the last 30 years.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.856
It's crazy.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.736
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.736
Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.736
But people do, because it's so cheap,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.016
and so our whole food system
in the last 30 years has really shifted.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.736
I mean, you know,
it's not just in our own country,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.696
but really we're exporting
the system around the world,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.616
and when you look at the data
of least developed countries --

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.056
especially in cities,
which are growing really rapidly --
