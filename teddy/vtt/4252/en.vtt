00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.536
I'm Ellen and I'm totally
obsessed with food.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.560
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.

00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:08.036
I started out obsessed
with global security policy,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.516
because I lived in New York during 9/11
and it was a very relevant thing.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.493
I got from global security policy to food

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.236
because I realized when I'm hungry,
I'm really pissed off,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.436
and I'm assuming
the rest of the world is too.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.156
Especially if you and your kids are hungry
and your neighbor's kids are hungry

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.036
and your whole neighborhood is hungry.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.216
And actually, it looks like
the areas of the world that are hungry

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.936
are also the areas of the world
that are pretty insecure.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.696
So I took a job at the United Nations
World Food Programme
