00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.216
And the thing that's strange
about international hunger

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.096
and talking about international issues

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.736
is that most people want to know:

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.216
"What are you doing for America's kids?"

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.256
There's definitely hunger in America:

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.816
49 million people
and almost 16.7 million children.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.216
I mean that's pretty dramatic
for our own country.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.776
Hunger definitely means
something different in America

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.216
than it does internationally,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.416
but it's incredibly important
to address hunger in our own country.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.136
But the bigger problem
that we all know about is obesity,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.416
and it's dramatic.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.936
The other thing that's dramatic

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.416
is that both hunger and obesity
have really risen in the last 30 years.
