Whatâ€™s the best country 
in the world to live in?

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.885
Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.386
The best weather?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.183
For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.476
to answer that question.

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:25.688
This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy.

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:28.149
But it was never intended
for its current purpose;

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.071
and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever.
