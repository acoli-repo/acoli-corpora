Melatonin is a hormone,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:05.209
often called the hormone of darkness,

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:10.590
simply because melatonin tells your brain
and your body that it's nighttime

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.091
and that it's time to sleep.

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.762
Melatonin is naturally
produced by your brain,

00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:19.682
and it's released by a very small gland
deep within your brain,

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:21.392
called the pineal gland.

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:25.354
However, you can also buy melatonin
in certain countries,

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.941
and some people will try
to use it as a sleep aid.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.404
But melatonin isn't quite
as effective as you may think.
