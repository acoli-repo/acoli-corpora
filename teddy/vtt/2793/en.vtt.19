00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.736
without impeding its flow.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.040
And this is exactly how our system works
on a much, much smaller scale.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.456
The idea here is that
the separation process for screening

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.536
could be as simple as processing
a sample of urine, blood or saliva,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.856
which is a near-term possibility
within the next few years.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.176
Ultimately, it could be used
to isolate and detect target exosomes

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.416
associated with
a particular type of cancer,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.880
sensing and reporting
their presence within minutes.
