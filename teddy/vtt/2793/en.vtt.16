WEBVTT

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.776
a process requiring
expensive laboratory equipment,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.056
a trained lab tech

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.120
and about 30 hours of time
to process a sample.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.256
We've come up with a different approach
for achieving automated exosome isolation

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.720
from a sample such as urine.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.816
We use a chip-based, continuous flow
separation technique

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.816
called deterministic lateral displacement.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.216
And we have done with it

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.696
what the semiconductor industry has done
so successfully for the past 50 years.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.776
We shrunk the dimensions
of this technology

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.440
from the micron scale
to the true nanoscale.
