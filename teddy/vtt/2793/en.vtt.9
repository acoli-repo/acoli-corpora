00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.776
your doctor can take
a simple, noninvasive urine sample,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.040
or other liquid biopsy,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.244
and present you with the results
before you even leave the doctor's office.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.336
Such a technology could
dramatically reduce the number of people

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.600
who slip through the net
of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.656
My research team
of engineers and biochemists

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.720
is working on exactly this challenge.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.456
We're working on ways to frequently
activate an early-stage cancer alarm

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.816
by enabling regular screenings
that would start when a person is healthy

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.136
so that action could be taken
to stop cancer the moment it emerges,
