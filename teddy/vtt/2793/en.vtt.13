00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.176
which contain surface receptors,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200
proteins and other genetic material
collected from their cell of origin.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.176
When absorbed by a neighboring cell,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.016
exosomes release their contents
into the receiving cell,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.256
and can set in motion
fundamental changes in gene expression --

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.496
some good,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.256
and this is where cancer comes in,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.856
some bad.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.656
Because they are clothed
in the material of the mother cell,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.616
and contain a sample of its environment,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.720
they provide a genetic snapshot
of that cell's health and its origin.
