00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.906
or they may develop breast cancer

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.050
before the middle age recommendation
for having a mammogram.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.816
So, there's still
a lot of room for improvement,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.096
even for cancers
that do have screening options,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
and, of course, considerable benefits
for those that don't.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.416
A key challenge then
for cancer researchers

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.736
is to develop methods

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.296
that make regular screening
for many types of cancers

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.560
much more accessible.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.976
Imagine a scenario
where during your regular checkup,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.776
your doctor can take
a simple, noninvasive urine sample,
