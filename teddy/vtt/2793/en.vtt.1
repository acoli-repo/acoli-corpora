00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.936
roughly one-third
of cancer survivors here in the US

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.696
will go into debt from treatment.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.456
And they're at least two and a half times
more likely to declare bankruptcy

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.720
than those without cancer.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.056
This disease is pervasive.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.656
It's emotionally draining

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.896
and, for many,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.320
financially destructive.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.440
But a cancer diagnosis
doesn't have to be a death sentence.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.776
Finding cancer early,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.016
closer its genesis,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.656
is one of the critical factors
to improving treatment options,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.656
reducing its emotional impact
