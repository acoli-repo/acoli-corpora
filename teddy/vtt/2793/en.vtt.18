00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.080
The net result is a complete separation
of these two particle populations.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.136
You can visualize this separation process

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.016
similar to traffic on a highway
that separates into two roads,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.496
with one road going into
a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.576
and the other road going around it.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.376
Here, smaller cars
can go through the tunnel

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.696
while larger trucks,
carrying potentially hazardous material,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.480
are forced to take the detour route.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.696
Traffic is effectively separated
by size and contents

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.736
without impeding its flow.
