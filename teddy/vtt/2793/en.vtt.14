00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.720
they provide a genetic snapshot
of that cell's health and its origin.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.336
All of these qualities
make exosomes invaluable messengers

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.976
that potentially allow physicians

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.920
to eavesdrop on your health
at the cellular level.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.736
To catch cancer early, however,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.696
you have to frequently
intercept these messages

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.216
to determine when cancer-causing
troublemakers within your body

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.056
decide to start staging a coup,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.096
which is why regular
screening is so critical

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.960
and why we're developing
technologies to make this possible.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.776
While the first exosome-based diagnostics
emerged on the market just this year,
