Having the convenience and accessibility
of regular screening options

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.016
that are affordable, noninvasive
and could provide results much sooner,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.480
would provide us with a formidable
weapon in the fight against cancer.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.816
An early warning would allow us
to get out ahead of the disease

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.576
instead of merely
following in its relentless wake.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.576
And this is exactly what I've been doing.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.736
For the past three years,
I've been developing technologies

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.496
that could ultimately aid clinicians

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.440
with rapid, early-stage
cancer diagnostics.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.776
And I've been fueled
by a deep scientific curiosity,
