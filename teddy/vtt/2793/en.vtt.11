00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.880
they're extremely attractive
for noninvasive liquid biopsies.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.616
There's just one problem.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.936
An automated system for rapidly sorting
these important biomarkers

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.560
is not currently available.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.976
We've created a technology
that we call nano-DLD

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120
that is capable of precisely this:

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.616
automated exosome isolation

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.120
to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.576
Exosomes are the newest
early-warning weapon, if you will,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.656
to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.
