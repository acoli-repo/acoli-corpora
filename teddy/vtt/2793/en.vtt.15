While the first exosome-based diagnostics
emerged on the market just this year,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.080
they are not yet part
of mainstream healthcare options.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.176
In addition to their recent emergence,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.656
another factor that's limiting
their widespread adoption

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.616
is that currently, no automated
exosome isolation system exists

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.840
to make regular screening
economically accessible.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.536
The current gold standard
for exosome isolation

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.496
includes ultracentrifugation,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.776
a process requiring
expensive laboratory equipment,
