00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.656
to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.976
And they're really, really small.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.520
They measure just 30 to 150
nanometers in diameter.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.576
This is so tiny

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.240
that you could fit about a million
of them into a single red blood cell.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.136
That's roughly the difference
between a golf ball

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.880
and a fine grain piece of sand.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.616
Once thought to be little bins
for unwanted cellular waste,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.616
it has been found
that cells actually communicate

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.776
by producing and absorbing these exosomes

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.176
which contain surface receptors,
