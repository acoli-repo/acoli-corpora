00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.656
reducing its emotional impact

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640
and minimizing financial burdens.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.775
Most importantly,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.056
finding cancer early --

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.976
which is one of the primary
aims of my research --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.160
greatly enhances your odds of survival.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.856
If we just look at the case
of breast cancer for example,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.376
we find that those who are diagnosed
and treated at stage one

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.160
have a five-year survival rate
of nearly 100 percent --

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
odds that decrease to just 22 percent
if treated at stage four.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
And similar trends are found
for colorectal and ovarian cancer.
