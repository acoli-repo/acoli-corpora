00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.136
so that action could be taken
to stop cancer the moment it emerges,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.840
and before it can progress
beyond its infancy.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.656
The silver bullet in this case
are tiny vesicles,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.120
little escape pods regularly shed
by cells called exosomes.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.416
Exosomes are important biomarkers

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.720
that provide an early-warning system
for the development of cancer.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.136
And because they're abundantly present
in just about every bodily fluid,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.656
including blood, urine and saliva,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.880
they're extremely attractive
for noninvasive liquid biopsies.
